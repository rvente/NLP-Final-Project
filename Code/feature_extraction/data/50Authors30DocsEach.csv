-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"Thought I should get a tire quote at the Walmart across from Canadian Tire on Macleod Trail.  Parking was a bit messy today, as Christmas shopping is well into its inertia.  A woman formally greeted people at door and with me she greeted me in my native language which was surprising and a nice personal gesture.

I got to the tire counter and there was no one around for 15 minutes, there was also a note on the door revealing that they were fully booked today for appointments and this was on a Sunday.  A saleslady finally appeared out of nowhere and punched in my specs on the computer but didn't have enough expertise to fully find me the right tire.  Although she was friendly and polite, it was very low service compared to the full service I received at Canadian Tire where the salesman there actually pointed out tires to me and gave me good recommendations.  

So counter service is definitely lacking here.  I went away with a print out but I still didn't not know if the price she quoted me were the prices specific for my vehicle and usually she said there would be a two week waits for tires there as their stock is limited.  I guess I could come back and check but why would I come back here in the future?  When what I will expect is the same ambiguous answers about my vehicle; what a waste of time that would be.

So I walked out of the store a little disappointed but at least I had an answer. While I was leaving, I noticed how disorganised Walmart was that day, I don't know if it is the fluorescent lighting or the lower ceilings with that tacky ceiling tile; but everything seemed a bit in disarray.  

Shopping at Coop or Costco or the Superstore just has a more spacious airy feeling.  I suddenly felt claustrophobic and had to get out.  

The woman at the door was the only refreshing element at Walmart that day who bid me goodbye again in my native language."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"Okay, when I first moved to Calgary I knew I needed three things, Wi-Fi internet, good coffee and a good hairstylist.  It was recommended I go to Chatters Salon at the Market Mall but specifically to the owner there.  When I arrived the only appointment they could schedule me in was with another stylist but I thought what the heck, my friend's hair seemed fierce, I trust the owner hired competent stylists, so I took it.

While I waited I needed some sort of guidance, no problem; picture books.  Salons always had the latest styles in magazines in their shop.  Well guess what? Not a magazine about hair in sight.  There was the latest who is sleeping with who garbage but nothing else that spoke of hair or even fashion for that matter.  

I then started to be aware of the hair stylists working at the salon and I started to get scared, there was not one modern hairstyle in the whole sea of stylists there, and not a shred of fashion sense.  They say the best marketing you can do is show off the product on yourself, I thought if the staff here have no taste, would that translate into their work?

Finally seated, my hairstylist took a spray bottle and wet my hair, hey where was the shampooing and the fine smelling Aussie conditioner? Where was the complimentary coffee and head massage for that matter? What I got was spray, spray, spray and then cut, cut, cut.  It was the worse haircut I have ever gotten in my life, it basically was a shortening of the hairstyle I originally had except minus an inch.  There was no layering, no pinning up, no shearing, nothing.  In fact, to top it all that disappointment off, was this ludichrist price tag at the end for what I had just received.  I mean it felt like a very expensive Magic Cuts.

So sorry Chatters, I don't know how you are still managing a cliental, perhaps the convenience of being at a mall.  I honestly don't get it."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"My mother handed my cousins and I her credit card and said go enjoy your cousin's birthday.  What she did was the worst mistake a mother can do, offer the open option agreement.  I believe in her head she thought we would modestly go for pizza or perhaps if a little daring Chinese.  Oh no of course not, we headed directly to Ruth's Chris.  

Ruth's Chris Steak House sits directly at the base of the Calgary Tower; I don't need a view to enjoy what I know to be a very expensive meal.  Entering the restaurant, we were literally giggling, I mean my cousins and I are well beyond our late twenties.  But giggling?  

Of course we started our first course with martinis, whisky and white wine.   Appetizers of shrimp, and salads were soon ordered.  What another round of drinks? Sure! And of course what RC's is known for, top of the line Alberta Grade A beef, I mean this is a steak house.  Be careful though, if you do order one of the many sides, (baked potato, mashed potato etc) just get one because these are big portions and can be an even bigger dent to the pocket book if ordered per person.

The ambience in this place is dressed for Calgary's elite; a very classy deco interior, with brass and dark wood detailing, staff is formal, friendly and pristine.  Dressed to the tens with the best service this city should offer, we were absolutely delighted.  

So the ticket price of 3, enjoying drinks, appys and a steak meal at RC's?  Well it's 40 for 50 dollars a steak, so round it off $300 and don't forget the 20% gratuity.  

In this yelpers opinion, is it worth the hype? If you want to impress a very important business associate perhaps,   but for you're out of town guests or that special steak meal, R.C's is not my personal first choice, I can enjoy a nice meal at the Keg or Cattle Baron for half the price.

Needless to say my mother never offered her credit card again."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"I can't believe this place didn't have people here on a Monday night; Imagine we were the only people in the whole restaurant.   This place needs more traffic, it is definitely underrated as I had a very nice huge meal, the service was excellent and my arm was sore from throwing a bowl into the fire pit.

Mykonos is hard to miss, sitting directly on Centre Street with a huge looming neon light.   There are two places to venture into the lounge and the restaurant.  My stomach growled the restaurant, so we picked a nice spacious table for two in the blue and white motif.  A candle was lit and we were brought menus right away by our very nice server Wayne.

The bread that is placed on your table is worth the meal in itself, this is high quality fibrous bread that is delicious and almost has sweetness to it.  I ordered the Souvlaki Dinner which had two tremendous skewer portions of pork marinated in herbs and spices, a large Greek salad and hearty roasted potatoes.  My friend had the Lamb Shish Kabob which was marinated chunks of lean tender meat, green peppers, onions and tomatoes, roasted potatoes and rice pilaf.  Both platters were big enough to keep us from conversation and full enough from ordering the Chocolate Lava Cake.

Wayne was both warm and friendly and we found out later that he was tending bar plus serving us so his service must have been immaculate because we didn't even notice.  Then when we asked for the bill,  two bowls were set for us to throw at the fire pit and yell ""Opa"" for good luck.  

This is an exciting prospect, I have never hurled anything for no reason so to pitch a fine chuck and crash was so exhilarating for both my friend and I.  I think Wayne noticed our glee that he gave us two more bowls but we decided instead to keep them as tokens of our fine meal and experience in Mykonos.

Definitely an amazing and non forgettable meal to say the least."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"Well we had a huge family reunion today at Milestones at the South Centre; without a reservation we asked for a table for 12 and were seated fairly quickly.  

The waitress looked overwhelmed she was expecting another party of 10 beside us, but it didn't seem to affect her service.  

This Milestone is classically designed, nice chocolate brown palette with comfortable seating and dimmed lighting.  Perhaps a modern take on European art nouveau.  

Menu design was really nice too; a threefold menu with leather covers, it was easy to read and was very elegant to hold. I decided on the night's special of Sirloin Steak with shrimp and lobster topping, everyone else was in a steak mood, so there were many orders of rib eyes, and prime ribs at our table.  

We settled for two nice Australian bottles of red wine, and  I made a note that our waitress was both sweet and efficient. 

There was not ever a lull in the courses, mine however was the only one that included a very large Cesar Salad, which was really yummy, I could taste the shredded fresh garlic and it had a slight hint of anchovy.  

It wasn't long before our entrees came and were passed out rapidly at our table.  My steak although medium rare was a little tough and others commented that it wasn't the best steak that they had tasted.  

The garlic mashed potatoes however were very nice, but my special order came with only 3 shrimps and a very small piece of lobster, definitely disappointing.

Four or five desserts were then ordered and these were all priced quite reasonably at seven dollars, were served in good portions and were very tasty.  

All in all for 12 people it was $500 including the tip, not bad, but  Milestone would not be the first choice for me to eat steak in the future.

All in all however, Milestones South Centre is a nice location, very near to South Centre Mall, has a classy interior and pleasant service."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"I recently answered a job offer on Craigslist which stated ""In the chaos of unpacked boxes you orchestrate a home masterpiece!"" which I quickly answered and got.  Basically I curated this woman's art, sacred objects and artifacts collection and needless to say it was a very memorable week working in what you can imagine to be a very eclectic home.  When the job finished my client invited the crew and I to a celebration dinner which brought us to a restaurant in Inglewood on 9th avenue S.E. called Sugo Caffe Italia.

Just sitting outside Sugo I felt underdressed and so did my co-workers but our appetites and curiosity managed to find our way into the restaurant where our reservation of 6 was warmly greeted by the staff.  The decor in this restaurant is exquisite, simple and clean with accents of contemporary earthy art pieces on warm muted walls.  Jarred tomatoes and jams are illuminated upwards with mini lights shining brightly from beneath them and antique chandeliers hang above dripping with crystal raindrops and lined pearl beads.  There is no corner that has not been thought out decoration wise here and the table settings are complete with artisan ceramics and fine crystal glassware.

An average meal is between 20 to 40 dollars but once you savour the many dishes on a menu that changes every evening and the many cheese options that I couldn't pronounce you are completely titillated.  Every meal's presentation has been evoked with an artist's touch and the freshest ingredients are presented in front of you to tantalize your palate.  I was extremely impressed by an ample Scotch list, over 15 choices and the huge portions of deserts that were presented in the most elegant formations that look like one could almost wear them as head pieces.

I was so impressed by Sugo the first time that I took my partner there to have our own celebration dinner the very next evening.

Absolutely 5 stars without a question."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"The Deane House on 9th avenue S.E. sits very pretty alongside the Elbow River and has been on my list of places to visit for months, finally the other day I ventured over for lunch, only to find that this house also has tons of history.  Nearly 100 years old the Victorian house was home to the first RCMP in Calgary and is also part of Fort Calgary's Interpretive Center.  The Deane house offers brunch and lunch which consists of salads, pasta dishes and steak but for $25 you can also have a lunch menu of 4 courses which I believe changes every day.

You have the option of sitting indoors and looking at the river from the window or sitting near the garden, so my friend and I opted to sit in the backyard near the garden.  The home is quite quaint and there were many passersby that day which made the meal even more enjoyable.  Many wild ducks and geese are known to come from the shores of the Elbow River to take advantages of the wonderful crabapples that fall from the trees just in front of the house.

The waitress was very friendly and it wasn't long before we received our meals.  The cheeseburger there which according to the waitress is the best burger she has ever had in her life is I must admit quite up there in ranks for me as well.  The beef is grade A and it is garnished withe usual toppings but flourished with sun dried tomatoes and the option of a baked potato or potato wedges.  Delicious!

The Deane House is also home to local theatre companies who  perform ""Mystery Dinners"" where clients take part in staged murders that happen during the meal.  I was quite intrigued by this until my friend informed me that the Deane House is also well known as being a place of strange happenings, its haunted reputation is well visited by patrons because of this.  I thought it was a joke until we walked back to my car in the parking lot and I could swear I saw the curtain move upstairs.

I will definitely visit again during Halloween.  Moo HaHa"
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"Diner Deluxe is just what it states it is, a deluxe diner, set on the Edmonton Trail and right next door to the Urban Baker.  

Be prepared to be flung into the time, as the interior decor is all 50's.  Chrome tables and chairs, 50s lamps, and 50's island tables that surely came out of some Jetson episode.  There is a great mismatch of retro coffee cups and teapots here even the high chairs that line the hallway to the bathroom are authentically 50s.

The restaurant was not busy today which is from what I heard a slight miracle, so there was a really nice chill atmosphere to the sounds of 50's lounge music in the background.

Staff is very nice here and they tried desperately to get the permission of the owner to take photos of the restaurant; first she said yes and then she changed her mind and said no.  I don't really understand this idea, don't you want your restaurant to be known and isn't any publicity good especially if it is free, whether it be by word of mouth or via a review.  I mean it is a compliment if someone finds your place interesting enough to photograph it.  Enuf said.

Let's stick to the highlights then; The Menu. 

Seems there are tons of breakie reviews here so I will concentrate on the supper menu.  The supper menu or ""Classic Mains"" are around 17 dollars and all the offerings sound so delicious.

The Macaroni has sun dried tomatoes and basil, pesto and white cheddar.  Grilled New York Steak has caramelized onions, and potato wedges. Lamb shank has horse radish and Dijon, root vegetables and mashed potatoes.

I myself dove into the Meatloaf which had Dijon and mashed potatoes, pan gravy, and red pepper jelly. Yummy!

From beginning to end you are taken on a gastronomic voyage, it surely is worth the visit, and is I imagine a huge icon here in Calgary.  

I however take out one star for the hesitancy to promote what you have been working for, plus I was treated with such suspicion. Looks like other yelpers have done it anyways."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"I was elated upon hearing that there was a Mac Cosmetics store here in Calgary.  I have been an actor in the Film and TV industry for years and most productions have used Mac Cosmetics on us as on-camera makeup.  My skin never reacted badly to it, and it always gave me a very natural glow, so I continued using it as my own personal makeup.

The store in Chinook is a nice space, it's a smaller store than what I am used to and this affects the stock that they can carry.  The girl assisting us was extremely friendly and informative and even so I couldn't help but notice that the staff here had overt amount of makeup on, and dare I say it, they looked like clowns.  Mac always prides itself on having natural looking makeup so I don't know why these girls were packing on the goods; the lighting is also very bright in this location so the results are even more heightened.  Perhaps this is intentional on Mac's part, I am not quite sure.  I have used Mac for years so I know the benefits of MC but if you are new to MC these faces may scare customers off.

There are also mirrors and make up chairs in the store, and MC offers make-up makeovers free of charge if make-up stylists in store are free and have the time to make you over.   For $55 you can make an appointment for a personal makeover and you get a free mascara or for $110 you can actually have MC teach you how to apply your own make-up.  Making over one half of your face and you are encouraged after the class to apply your own make-up on the other half of your face from what you learned.  With this $110 package you also get a free mascara.

Another perk that Mac offers is a 30 to 40 % discount to professional artists, you just need to ask for an application, be reviewed by Mac Pro central and upon approval they then can send you a Mac Pro card.

Chinook is a convenient location, I would like to compare it to the other stores in Calgary and to the counter at the Bay, but all in all the service was good."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"Winter is around the corner folks and you know what that means, WINTER tires! Well I have been avoiding getting new tires ever since I bought my used vehicle but a friend recommended getting them now while they are still available and cheap.

Decided to do some pricing and this is what I found at the local Canadian Tire.  First of all, free parking and a huge store.  I have forgotten how lovely CT is;  I mean it carries everything not only automotive stuff, there is the household area, toys, sporting goods, weights, there is already even ten rows for Xmas decorations.  I was so distracted by other things that I needed to buy that I totally forgot about my first intention for coming.

Once focused I ventured to the automotive area, and there was a full service staff there attending to customers.  I finally found George and I knew it was him as CT now has plasma TVs that proudly display mug shots of their service workers.  It was funny talking to George as his photos sat grimly behind him over his right shoulder.  ""Ignore it"" he said ""the only thing it lacks is the line of numbers on the bottom and a profile shot"".  I instantly took a liking to this guy.

He explained that winters tires are seasonal especially studded ones, and that by city law you could only drive winter tires with studs from now until May.  I would be looking at buying another set of tires in 6 months.  To save money he said to go with the all season tire and that if I wasn't planning on doing much driving I would be okay with the most economical one.  We talked for at least 30 minutes, George showing me many examples of tires, the difference in grade and wear and the CT guarantee.  He gave me quotes and printed my options; it was the best service I had ever gotten at an automotive store. Not once did I see George TIRE!  Hee hee

All in all exceptional service and great prices.  CT has always been consistent for this, I have dealt with CT all my driving life, so get your tires here and don't be left out of the cold literally."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"The Barking Lot Groom, is grrrooooming with not just puppy dog clients, the cats dig this service too.

I went the other day to check out prices for a friend and out ran an animal that looked like part tiger and part dog... I guess it was Charlie who just got a lion cut.  He was so happy and he was so soft. He was really excited to see his mother and she paid all of a $40 for his sleek trim.  At BLall cuts are done by hand. (see photos).  His mother said she has been a client for years and totally recommends the services here, she know she can count on BL for the love and attention that Charlie needs.

Accordingly to the very nice grrrroomer there, BL has been around for 30 years, they are located in the Shawnessy area however which is really lucky for Shawnessy and surrounding residents because this groomer was one of the nicest people.  She has been doing it for 9 years and really loves working with her clients but most of all the animals.

She mentioned so many things that I didn't know, for example when an animal gets longer haired the hair can get matted which is can get really heavy for the animal. Also having a haircut allows oxygen to get into their scalp which is very important it helps maintain them physically and is just a natural thing that should be done every 3 or 4 months.
Prices here can range from $40 up to $200.  She even took the time to show me before and after photos of the animals, which was so kind of funny because it was like a pictorial makeover series. First you saw the animal looking so ferociously furry and the next photo you don't even recognise them, they look like another animal.  What I saw from the photos however was very good work and the animal looked so much healthier and lighter.

The place has many grooming stations and is very clean; they have tons of clients and a food and product store just across the parking lot. The most impressive component for me is that the grooming is done by hand, no noisy trimmers and it just means more personable and caring service for the animal."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"Silly me, I lost my cell phone yesterday and it felt like I had literally lost my right arm.  I can't believe how dependant I am on that thing, for socialising, work and just common errands, last night it dawned on me that it really is close to being a best friend.  

Well the first thing I did last night was temporarily deactivate my account which you can easily do by calling in with your phone number and your code.  But all night I prayed that someone did not pick it up and insanely make long distance calls until I suspended my number.  I couldn't sleep properly the whole night dreaming about Fido bills and large amounts but I did manage to wake up at the crack of dawn and drive myself to the Fido store at the Chinook Centre.

This store although quite petite, carries all the current models of Fido, some accessories and here you can pay your bill or complain about your phone if it is not working.  I wasn't too excited about the models that Fido is carrying right now, they all seem to be plastic casings and one drop from me and I know that would be it for my phone.  The last one I had was a Motorola and it was slightly metal so I liked the weight of it and the feel of it in my hand.  

I finally settled on a streamlined Nokia flip and with the Fido dollars I had accumulated my new phone cost me $17 which could be added to my next bill. Wow, I love this!

Dexter the sales clerk was great, he showed me all the models, explained the pros and cons of each one. LG had really nice designs but he warned me against those as they have already had problems with them.  He got me a new SIM card, got my new cell phone activated within minutes, and at the moment we turned it on, I was already receiving some business phone calls.

Losing a phone with is awful but reinstating it with Fido was a breeze, I was really amazed about the customer service, the quickness of the whole thing and the security protection you automatically get.

Plus I am still wagging my tail at 2000 minutes a month for 40 bucks, thanks Dexter and thanks Fido."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"Man I love Filipino parties, I love the chaos and the silly chismis (gossip), the bad karaoke but most of all I love the food.

Usually at Filipino parties that I venture everyone cooks, we bring our platters and then we all dive in, but at Liza's birthday party I went to on Saturday, it had a different slant in that it was catered by a Chinese restaurant.

I was introducing myself with people but in my periphery I had my eye on the food.  I know it is rude but I have perfected this socialization skill so that people don't notice. The presentation of the 10 uniform pans and the smell was way too distracting.

Caterer of choice today at Liza's birthday was Home Food Inn Peking Cuisine.  There were 10 large pans all lined up on the food table, about 10 by 14 inches, and all were brimming with oriental goodness.
Sweet and Sour Pork, Ginger Grade A Beef, Pineapple Sweet and Sour Chicken, Salt and Pepper Squid, Honey and Garlic Ribs, Beef and Broccoli just to name a few.

Highlights for me this evening was the Salt and Pepper Squid; these are large squid portions deep-fried just perfectly with a hint of pepper, you couldn't taste the salt and served with red onion and of course the Pineapple Sweet and Sour Chicken which were also larger portions accompanied with diced carrots, the pineapple not to sweet but blended tastefully with the sour of the carrots.

Liza told me that each pan serves approximately 10 people and vary in price from 32 to 39 dollars.  . She also informed me that if you do order quite a large number of entrees they will give you a deal and deliver it to your party free of charge. Nice one Home Food Inn!

Not bad, so around $350 for 40 guests that showed up that evening, and there was still tons of food left over.  And you know Filipinos love leftovers so the crowd was just overjoyed.  

It really makes up for the next stage that every Filipino party has and one that I consistently have to endure ... the Karaoke.  But as much as I resist this cultural ritual I notice I am usually the one handling the mike at the end of the evening."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"Hippy New Years everyone!!  Welcome to 2010!

The hotspot of choice for this yelper to bring in the new years was The VIN Room in the Mission Area.

There was an awkward reservation/table misunderstanding at the beginning but that was very easily cleared up, and we found ourselves upstairs at a swagger table for two by the window.   Very elegantly dressed and extremely cozy.

The top floor stays in keeping with the decor of first floor, with black wallpapered walls with just a hint of floral design.  Deep chocolate brown highlights and a punch of aquamarine blue in the glass candle holders to rightly bring all that class together.

Bursts of black accents embracing light fixtures and a modern fireplace with sleek mosaic work at the far end of the room.  It was all so perfect for setting a tone for a great New Year's to come.

Tonight VIN offers a 4 course New Years Eve Dinner with a wine pairing list if you choose to step it up a notch. I wanted to ease down on the drinking this year and decided to try a couple of 2 oz glasses of red instead which were both full bodied and smoky.

The first course was served immediately upon sitting, a simple combination of capresse skewers with pita and white bean dip.  
The second course were these extremely delicious cod cakes.  These just melted in my mouth.  With these two courses we were already full but when the lamp chops were presented in front of me, of course I found room for them.  These were grilled to perfection and accompanied with a wonderful mint sauce. 

All courses were served at the appropriate intervals, and Phoebe the owner checked in on us periodically which is always a nice personal touch.

And finally to bring everything together a nice smooth Crème Brule for dessert.  

The New Years Eve Dinner was only $45, which was amazing considering the quality and portions of all four courses.

It was such a wonderful evening overall, and we still had enough time to dance the night away.

Again I insist in review number three, that Vin Room serves it up as one of the best spots for wine, food and ambiance."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"I got an entertainment coupon book for Christmas so occasionally I will try a random restaurant from there.  I have been slightly disappointed in Mexican restaurants here in Calgary but I decided to give this one a chance.

Boy, am I glad, the gold and red curtains were all too incongruent with Mexican motiff but when I entered the restaurant I must admit with the mural, the tacky Mexican ceramic decorations and the Chivas and Americas Football poncho, I really did feel like I was in a restaurant in Guadalajara.

According to the owner there, his father owns a restaurant in Zapopan and they are trying to do the same dishes here as they do there.  He explained all this while serving me a complementary tortilla chip basket with authentic Mexican salsa and another jalapeño pepper and carrot mix.  I was uber glad because this was a really good sign as both were pretty authentic tasting.

He then told me the cooks were both from Mexico, one from Mexico City and the other from Sinaloa, again a good sign.  There are many ingredients he cannot get here, like Oaxaca or Requesón Cheese, so they have to substitute it with others.   But he assured me that the mole here was the same, they do use the cacao chocolate from Oaxaca and he has cheeses like ""queso de chipotle"".

I ordered the Chimichangas and the Burritos, both lunch orders were huge and under $9.  I couldn't believe the pricing here, not bad.  Dinner menu sees bigger portions and higher prices but both of my meals were delicious and I was very full.

The tacos that Mexicans actually eat are about 2 inches in width that are double layered then sprinkled with whatever topping you want, chicken or beef, pork or chorizo, then you have the choice to add onion, cilantro and salsa.  The larger tacos you see being served here are actually Tex Mex and really are a huge bastardization of the Mexican taco.

Here at Los Mariachis they have tacitos the way they should be small, delicious and potent.  I am elated; finally a Mexican restaurant that I can come and speak bad words in Spanish and eat a decent meal.  K RICO!!!"
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"I am super stuffed; it is Chinese New Years and my cousin's restaurant of choice is the Shangai Palace.  Not an empty seat in the whole restaurant tonight, and our 13 person family table certainly didn't help matters.

But let me tell you, we had a feast, an absolutely amazing feast; the only thing lacking was if we had actually eaten this on a candlelit table under a clear night outside in Shangai!  We started with an amazing Peking duck which was so perfect.  It was sliced thinly with just enough crunchy skin to insert into our tortillas with that spicy sweet sauce.  

Second course were two types of shrimp, one with some mayonnaise dressing, which I felt was too rich and a sweet and sour version.
Course 3, sweet and sour pork, with fresh cucumber, sliced carrots, this was a huge portion, and in fact all plates were huge.

Course 4, a nice sour soup with crab, the remains of our duck and shitake mushrooms, by this point I was certainly getting full

Course 5, a whole fish, nicely steamed, with tons of herbs and lemon.

Course 6, a noodle dish, after all noodles in Phillipino represent long life.

Course 7, abalone and huge mushroom caps the size of my palm, these were amazing, so fresh and so succulent

Course 8, crab and lobster, this came with nut cracking thongs so you could really get yourself dirty.

Course 9 Cruncy tender chicken, this was just as good as the duck and super tasty.

According to my nephew rice is place on the table at the end of the meal so that the chef knows that he has done well, but we are a Filipino family and this was demanded around course 4.

Wait there is more, during the whole meal, our waters and Chinese teas were frequently filled, the wait staff was amazing, we rounded everything off with the desert buffet.

There was jello, and smiling fortune cookies and a mocha layered cake.  By this point, they had to roll me to my car, and I swear a couple of people mistook my tummy for Buddha's and rubbed it.

I did not know the total, my cousin is very discreet all I know is at the Shangai palace it is the next best thing to being in Shangai."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"I have mixed feelings about CPA.

First of all the pros.  It seems to be a well thought out system; the parking stands marked numerically, there is no paper work involved simply an entering of your license plate which then gets computerised somewhere in CPA cosmos.  They seem to be easy to find, you have an option of using change or your credit card, which is convenient.

I have received parking retributions in the mail, a photo of my lovely SUV and the appropriate time to pay which I think is clever, although there should be a 10 minute loading zone by this post office where I went to pick up a package and I don't agree with paying $2.50 do to that, but whatever, I paid the $40.00 repercussion.

So great diligence on parking surveillance team, photos were clear and I believe there were even two angles.

When I went down to pick up a parking pass for my residence, folks there were both pleasing friendly and humorous and I was able to get my sticker and a guest pass at no cost.

Cons, what's with these atrocious parking prices, are we in Toronto or New York for that matter?  Why must I pay 5.00 an hour to go to Chinatown or to Eau Claire market to see a movie? I am already paying 13.00 for the movie itself, so my movie outing is over 23.00?

And why are these parking stalls never working, change is always jammed up in the change slot, and they are more often out of order than working.  When I call an attendant, I get a machine so I am left to make a rapid decision of should I not pay here at this stall or risk the $40 I will get in the mail simply because of a computer malfunction?  Why isn't there diligence on parking stall maintenance, can they transfer some of the great organised energy form surveillance to keeping these stalls up to par.  After all 5.00 an hour, aren't we paying more than enough to actually own one of these?

Last but not least, why doesn't City Hall know where the CPA is? No one at information, nor at city planning has any idea nor phone number as to where to pay for parking fines, get permits etc.  I believe I was handed a number by some passerby working at the business permits area who overheard my conversation.

Okay this is the end of my official rant on Calgary Parking Authority."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"I have been avoiding Mexican restaurants like the plague here in Calgary.  I lived in Mexico for the last 8 years and refused to experience one as long as I possibly could just in case it would be pseudo Mexican or bad Tex Mex.  Tonight, however I have been saved.  I randomly turned off into a plaza that had a Mexican restaurant and thought well, good or bad I have to review it.  But to my surprise, Salt and Pepper on Macleod trail was amazing.  This is authentic Mexican food folks, yes hombres it is the real enchilada.

Salt and Pepper celebrates their 20th anniversary this year, owners are from Oaxaca Mexico and after cooking for everyone else decided to open this restaurant 20 years ago.  I ordered tacos tacos tacos, and a coffee and was quite relieved when I tasted the cinnamon in my coffee, it hurled me back into time.  While waiting, Mexican rock from a very popular Mexican group played in the background and I felt hopeful.  Imagine my elation when my tacos were served to me the right way.  Tacos in soft tortillas rolled, sprinkled with shredded lettuce and cheese.  Served in big platter with Mexican rice and frijol beans on the side. Que Bueno!!!  

But the real test.  Do you have any salsa I inquired? And yes she did.  In front of me was the salsa I have been eating at every taco stand, every restaurant and cafe in Mexico for the last 8 years.  Chopped tomato, onion, cilantro, lemon and jalapeno.  I smothered my meal with it; the chicken, ground beef and chorizo were perfection rolled.  Que Rico.

This restaurant is simple and clean, with Mexican decorative details, there are only 14 tables in this place but by 6 pm, the place was full.
If you want to eat authentic, Mexican food, this is the place to come folks.  

Expect to pay between 13 to 20 for the main dishes, which is a bit of a shock to me so therefore I take away one star.  I used to pay 50 cents a taco but I guess that is the standard rate you pay now at any restaurant here in Canada.  Better to pay these prices and get a good meal instead of an awful one.

For their 20th anniversary Salt and Pepper celebrates with half priced margaritas on Monday and all you can eat tacos on Tuesday nights.  Come in out of the cold and feel the heat.  ANDALE!"
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"I have tried to avoid going to any Casinos in Calgary simply because I love them and I know once I start I will go all the time.  I used to dress up in a black dress and wear lipstick and go to the casino in Montreal till wee hours in the morning pretending I was a big high roller from China, I am afraid I may have to start this obsession again because last night we went to this one.

Wow, this is like 10 blocks from my home and it has free parking; this is an all together huge seduction tactic for me, imagine me getting into my car and leaving it in underground heated parking that is free and sauntering directly to a slot machine at any hour of the given night.

They took my coat last night at the lobby and we were able to circulate the slot area.  Now I like to venture into a casino in intervals, checking out each section.  I obviously haven't been to a Casino for a long time as I was perplexed that the slots did not take your change, you could just slip your bill in and cash out getting a computerized stub which you could reinsert into any other machine of your choice.  

2 cents slot machine, I was absolutely tantalized until I realised you had to play these x 25.  

My honey and friends were Casino green so we decided on the nickel slots and I didn't play much as I was so entertained by their enthusiasm.  There were squeals of delight from winning ten credits, huge total earning of 50 cents and then tormented sounds from losing 5 dollars.  At one point my honey was aimlessly walking around with a 25 cent vouture trying to find that lucky machine.  It was really serious situation and it was all too funny in the end.

This place is really nice, it is only one level but it is spacious enough.   The staff here are really nice but they don't take kindly to photos being taken.  The place is fairly clean and elegant plus I would really love to take in the Asian buffet here.  

Soda pop is free while you play and the seats are fairly comfortable.  We left and everyone had actually won a little something so our green Casino friends had already made plans to return for another evening very very soon.

This idea makes me very happy; I am slowly taking out the lipstick from my makeup kit and setting it aside for these special outings."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"I am a very new yelper and let me just say how much I love you Yelp.  I wanted to go for an unforgettable meal with my partner to celebrate simply how amazing we are together.  And I researched the highest rated restaurants in the city.  I wanted something funky, avant garde and breathtaking and thanks to the Yelp crew I found it.

Raw Bar at Hotel Arts has to be one of the best dining experiences I have had in my life.  And I have travelled the world folks so this statement says a lot.  From the moment you enter the doors until you leave you are transported into a culinary journey.  

The foyer of this hotel is so well decorated with modern art and welcoming staff.  It is like visiting a very posh, stylish and hip place in New York City, yet it is not pretentious and is most affordable.  

We were led past corridors of abstract art and furniture to the alcove entrance of the Raw Bar; we were immediately seated in this moody, red lit, modern restaurant, with the most impressive layout. 
 
The waitress was delightful and quirky, water with cranberries and lemon were brought to the table.  And we splashed our palates with: for my sweetie a canton swizzle (whole lychees and fresh grapes that are pulverised with fresh lime and ginger ale) and I a lemon tree (a flute of sparkling plum wine blitzed with a fresh lemon sorbet).  My drink had a good amount of alcohol in it, Raw Bar is very generous when pouring drinks.

We started the evening with delightful salad of beets, pear, pine nuts and camembert cheese. My partner had the Pad Thai and I had the Brazened Rib with an artistic rouse of creamed potatoes and scallops.  We then rounded off the meal with coffee and a pumpkin, white chocolate cheesecake with dribbled caramel sauce.

All this in total came to under 100 dollars; which was unheard of, I nabbed 5 business cards to hand out to friends.  By the time it was 10 the place was full with bling and fashion.   Everyone there was in the high spirits and we realised that we were amidst Gemini award celebrations which gave the evening an even more Celebrity tone.

I will return many times to this establishment.  It is truly one of the finest hotspots in Calgary, thanks so much fellow yelpers you are doing a truly amazing job of highlighting the best we have to offer here."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"After reading amazing reviews about this place I was eager to enjoy it for myself, so I made sure to call beforehand to make sure that the place was open for lunch.  Parking is just 1 dollar an hour and it is located in the same building of Sushi Kai 609 just left of the door and up the ramp.

The restaurant seemed very inviting and the woman there was very friendly.  She sat us at a table for two right away and our table was adorned with ceramic plates, chopsticks and retro cups. The decor of the place was simple but nice and two plasma TVs loomed on two walls facing us.  I assumed these were the karaoke screens.

There is a very nice luncheon bento box for 10.95 by which you can choose two options from a list of 7: beef don, teriyaki chicken don, sashimi six pieces, sushi three pieces and roll, sushi six pieces, sushi twelve pieces, and dumplings.  This luncheon special comes with salad and a miso soup.

Everything was going fine until I asked about the sushi and the rolls; the waitress informed us that there was no sushi rice available at 3 as they were closing soon.  I was terribly confused; did I not phone and ask if they were open for lunch?  And she said she realised that she said yes but did not inform me that they would close at three.  I was a bit shocked; imagine a sushi restaurant without sushi rice.  So to save the meal I ordered the Fuji roll which thankfully didn't have rice.  We also decided to share a bento box.

The meal was delicious and the Sashimi of 6 pieces was incredibly fresh with large portions, but before we had a chance to order dessert, the waitress brought over the bill.  I did not ask for that yet, in fact I wanted to try one of the desserts that a yelper had recommended and she apologised again and said they were closing and could not serve this specific dessert.  Needless to say it was an anticlimactic meal, a bit of a rollercoaster. Full of unfulfilled promises plus they charged us for the chinese tea.

I really wanted to give this place a great review but I am afraid I can't, the woman had every opportunity to inform me on the phone that they would be closing at 3 and before getting settled at the table that they would be closing soon and had no rice.  The prices and presentation of the food was however very nice but I did not go away enjoying my meal experience there."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"This is a massive building behind Staples in the downtown area; it has a huge sign on it and reminds me of a grain elevator that you can see from miles away.

This place does carry grain; in fact it carries grains, organic vegetables, every type of tofu, tortilla chip and rice cake imaginable, and all type of natural food products.  But...let's not limit this place just to food, there is an area with yoga mats and clothing, there is an area of water bottles, there is a multivitamin and supplement area, there is a natural beauty product area, there is even a little buffet with tables as you come in.

Community Natural Foods ltd appeals to the community, a conscious community but a community that can afford its produce.  There were many people in today, the aisles were crowded; I did see a mother shopping with her two little girls and CNF has these little shopping carts so that little humans can shop here too...sooo cute.

The woman at the information desk was very very nice, explaining the concept of the store to me, they try to buy as much produce locally, but of course products are from all over, they do however carry locally bought organic meat and poultry which is a plus.  

I checked out the frozen products section and I saw items here that I have never seen in other food stores, even in the huge uber ""super"" stores:  frozen chicken butter curry, a vast assortment of bean burritos, oriental ginger chicken.  The concept of heating up an exotic meal in seconds is quite attractive and I must admit as I walked around looking at all the food that was good for me, I did start to feel a little more healthy inside.

But just as a few fellow yelpers have stated, why is this supposedly healthy food is so expensive, why again is it only available to people who can afford it, why shouldn't it be accessible for everyone.  If you do want these type of products I would recommend Sunnyside Natural Market in Kensington, of course the selection is limited but the prices are more affordable.

CNF has free parking in a lot outside and a community board with tons of services like massage and yoga etc, which again is good for you and overpriced.  

If you don't mind paying more money than usual for organic and natural products then this is your definite one stop place to visit.  

Community Natural Foods Ltd, for the rich community that is!"
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"Boogies have been around since the 70s; in fact they still have their original menu posted on their very blue walls. Can you imagine paying $1.10 for a burger, $1.25 for a banana split, 40 cents and 60 cents for an ice cream cone and one dollar for a milkshake?  

So here we are forty years later and inflation didn't really take much of its toll on Boogies.  Assorted burgers for fewer than 8 bucks and a great selection of milkshakes at $3.75.  I personally have problems with the name Boogies but for the sake of my review and for your appetites I will keep this problem to myself.

The interior is so fun, there are vintage gaming machines spread around the store, there is a tacky kitschy mural of a beach on its one wall and of course we can't forget the ""Employee of the Month wall"". Man these dudes are handsome, David Hasselhoff, Beef Supreme, a mug shot of James Brown, Forest Gump.  Dammnn...Some really good looking hunks up there (see photos)

The waitress was also an added decoration to Boogies with her great tattoos and purple hair, she was really attentive and totally laid back. 

And just like the scene the Menu was totally laid back as well; in fact your can add anything to your burger, mozza or cheddar, a fried egg, wieners, an extra chicken breast, pickles, or banana peppers.  You can add any of these fixings to their plus 20 burger selections.  

What I found most interesting however were the shake flavours, bubblegum, creamsicle, banana tiger, root beer, macaroon, peanut butter and banana which is the young Elvis and the Fat Elvis which is peanut butter, banana, and bacon.  Hilarious!

I myself indulged in a mushroom burger with mozzarella cheese and a butterscotch milkshake and my total bill came to a whopping $11.  This is a 100% grade A burger folks with a big bun, I digress by saying it would be great if they had a whole wheat bun option, I am not really a white bread fan.  At first I started eating it with a fork and knife and later dove into it with my hands, and l don't know what it is about a burger but it tastes so much better when you eat it in your hands.

It was definitely tasty, not the best burgers I have ever had mind you but nonetheless good.

All around 4 stars from the reviewer, I promise to come back Boogies to try out your yam fries and to gaze lovingly at your Employee of the Month wall once again."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"After wearing my favourite cotton black T-shirt and faded ripped Levis for three days, I realised it was definitely time to do my laundry.  And what better time to do it but at 8:00 pm, Monday night when the streets are empty and where Laundromats are basically all mine.  Following the allure of the neon yellow and blue sign I return once again to my favourite get your clothing clean hang out Oh Henry's Laundromat & Dry Cleaners on 18th Avenue SW.  Having convenient daily hours of 8 am to 10 pm, Oh Henry's is the best place to be to relax to an orchestra of humming washers and dryers, and to be serviced by helpful and effervescent staff.  This establishment has been around for more than 12 years according to the lady working there. For a mere 3 dollars and a handful of odd quarters I can always count on getting a double load of laundry done.  At every visit my clothing turns out consistently clean and the dryers do a great job of drying as well.  

A line of 70s vinyl brown chairs line the waiting room area facing a 40 inch television where ""Dances With the Stars"" is just about to begin, the lady there returns to the television to increase the volume yet for the third time asking me where Cheryl is?   I shrug my shoulders and smile because I see that this is her favourite part of the day, the closing of the night.  In this last hour is when she can concentrate on cleaning the day's residue of lint and single socks to the slaughtering of the Dances With the Stars judges.  I am now folding my second load of clothing, and notice the hand sharpied prices of pop, chips and the odd candy bars if you so need to nibble on something to pass the time.  Certificates line one wall of the establishment citing it as the ""Best Laundromat in the City of Calgary"".  Looks like Oh Henry's has claimed this prize for 8 years of its more than 12 years' incarnation.  Worthy of this merit, I must say, I always feel incredibly relaxed when I come here, and can always count on a random conversation with the local yokels and a very clean establishment.

 If you need clean laundry, ironing or drying cleaning done then this warm and modest place is the place to come. I hope Oh Henry's continues on for another more than 12 years to come.  In my head I secretly give Oh Henry's Laundromat and Dry Cleaners 4 stars and watch Macy Grey take the stage to do the Lambada."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"I have read rave reviews about BB and decided to go and see for myself last night.  After all it is only about 10 blocks from my home and I don't mind driving if I know I can at least walk home if I do get stuck in the snow.

You need to make reservations online or on a voice mail before you come here; otherwise you do not actually get a human voice to book one for you.  This was a little frustrating but luckily when we arrived they did have a couple of tables for two available for us, as the place was really jam packed tonight.  

There was tons of festive energy, attractive and interesting people to see at this restaurant. Plus BB has nice, big floor to ceiling windows that look onto a blue lit Christmas tree and the pulse of 17th Ave outside.

Hostess was in fine form this evening, and our jackets were taken hospitality at the door for us.  Our waitress this evening, Jenna was very funny, charming and accommodating as our server. 

The menu is a lot more reasonable in price than I had expected.  And I started off the evening with a very strong Mojito at $7.50 and ordered the lobster poutine for my friend and I as recommended by other yelpers.

I had heard rave reviews about this poutine, French fries, chunks of lobster, shellfish buttered sauce and mascarpone cheese. But tonight the butter was not melted properly and what I thought was a chunk of lobster was actually a spoon of butter. Not too thrilled about the poutine, there really weren't that many pieces of lobster and I expected a bit more for the $16, but we still had our entrees to look forward to.

My friend had the Lebanese chopped salad with pine nuts, parsley, mint and feta cheese and I had the shrimp pasta with olives and spinach and goat cheese.  We liked both of our plates and we were just about to order desert when another client in the restaurant joined our table.  He asked where the bathroom was and there was a huge sign above my friend's head that said ""washrooms"" so we both knew we were being fed a line.

He was entertaining for a short time but kind of overstayed his welcome when he started showing us some buttock clenching exercises. The waitress was a dear and practically saved us from our new guest, nonetheless the meal was if anything an entertaining one.  

I enjoyed my meal at BB, the prices were reasonable, the service was excellent and the ambiance was interesting to say the least."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"Location is downtown near the Eau Claire market, and my YMCA search continues.  

Luckily my neighbour works at this Y, and he has kindly given me passes to general locker room access and women's plus facilities.

First of all let me start with location, this is very central, downtown to be exact so what is our first hurdle? Parking! Parking downtown can be such a beyotch.  

Choices range from anywhere at Eau Claire market to surface parking with park plus at 5 to 8 dollars an hour, yes you read me correctly between 6am to 5 pm. Or simply pay an early bird rate of $25 dollars - $28 dollars maximum for the whole day.  If you go to the gym 3 times a week this will cost you well you do the math. Damnnnnn.  

So your best bet is the Calgary Curling Club during peak hours of 5 am - 6pm, which is one dollar for the first four hours and then 2 dollars thereafter.  This is located at 720 3 Street NW.

After 5pm, 2 dollars flat rate at Eau Claire market or surface parking and again your best bet is Calgary Curling Club which is free.  My head is in a confused tizzy, what the heck just take a bus there.

Okay let's get to the facility, nice facility, clean with two swimming pools, an indoor runny track, cardio and weight equipment and 50 drop in classes each week. There are two fitness studios, a full size gym, and a squash and racquetball/handball court.   This is all accessible at $59.11 a month and this Membership fee gives you access to all YMCAs in the city.

Now the beauty about this gym is that you have a Membership plus upgrade which gets you  whirlpool and steam pool access, private exercise and TV lounge area, you are given towel service and personal care products and there is laundry service but this is for men only. This is $77.31 a month for women and $91.53, wow that laundry perk is 20 bucks more, but then again have you done a man's laundry? 

There is also personal training staff that can assist you with personal training and you can anywhere from 1 to 40 sessions.

My visits have so far been very pleasant especially the member plus option, the comfy towels, blow dryers and curling irons are a nice touch, but what I love the most is the whirlpool and steam room comforts! 

The service is impeccable and the staff is extremely friendly, so if a downtown location is what you need you have several great options at this facility.  

I am docking a star because I think there should be a much affordable parking perk built in to the YMCA membership."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"I pass BLVD everyday on 4th Street to get home, it is an enormous corner building, it looks stupendous from the outside, and it has dim lighting and literally has two flaming centerpieces outside.  It is a place you want to keep at the back of your memory for a special occasion.  I was so excited when a friend choose this place as her Bday bash of choice; I was going to yelp it all up.  

My conclusion is this...what a disappointing dining and dancing location.
Entering the lavish interior is absolutely divine; it's like walking down the red carpet, the flaming entrances the huge glass doorways.  Upon Entering the bar is set up as the center focal point and the tables cascade to the sides in rich textures, comfortable seating with throw pillows. The waitresses I found dressed tastefully but were a bit too standoffish and a little cold as servers.

I was extremely careful not to eat much during the day as I was expecting 5 star plates.  What Blvd offers is simply small plates to share; most of the substantial stuff is not on the menu anymore; the lamb, the beef... so you are basically filling yourself up with light meals and alcohol.
I had a hummus, with focacio and lamb, I expect the lamb to be skewered, instead it was ground and not much of a serving, tons of hummus and bread though but eating that for a main course is just silly.  My one friend had the chicken pizza and it wasn't anything to write home about, basically she said it was like they ordered out at Boston, it was sliced up and served on her plate.  Another friend had some taste temptations thing, you can check it out in my photos, basically 8 servings on wonton spoons, and we thought it was a joke so we called it the anorexic dish.  So basically my friend of course not in the least bit full ended up sharing mine.  Presentation was okay but the food was so so and definitely not up to par with all the decoration hype. 

Blvd menu could use some tweaking from the Hotel Arts Food group in the city to bring their menu items up to the standards it should be.

The DJ then came on and it was more lounge and trance, we were going to stay to dance but there just wasn't a groove happening.

My biggest disappointment was when the bill came, it automatically got tagged with a server fee, which I am assuming was the tip, I think around 12%.  I really cannot tolerate this ... charging your cliental a mandatory gratuity as if we were somewhere like New York or Toronto.  Get your menu updated so it is mouth watering, have things on it that are actually available and put a warmer smile on your service staff to deserve that gratuity.

Read the other reviews on this yelp list BLVD, you're looks just ain't enough I am afraid."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"I have eaten twice at this Greek Restaurant and both times waiters were especially busy, I wonder if they get assigned more than 10 tables at a time?  But even so, I am seated quite quickly, and the service I get is always polite and friendly.  But one incident really made me appreciate the servers working at this place.

I was enjoying a meal outside on their patio during the Lilac Festival; I decided to sit outside to witness the on goings of the festivities and in general people-watch which I love to do.  That day was one of my most entertaining meals to date.  First of all Calgary has attracted an extremely multicultural population, not something I am used to considering I was the only Filipina in my small prairie town for around 15 years.  So this influx of colour and general celebration around me is always so refreshing. 

But then the Lilac started to draw to its closing, so people were returning home but folks who had been drinking obviously did not want to so there were literally 3 groups of drunk men who sat down at the patio, wanting to eat a meal and continue their partying on 17th.   

These groups were so unruly cursing at passers bys that the waitress had to ask them to leave.  Why is it that some drunken men think that when they have consumed alcohol they can shout out the rudest of comments to pick up women?  Do they think they are more attractive or charming?  It's just so embarrassing but so entertaining to watch them make asses of themselves.  

The waitress was strong and firm and she asked them to leave in such a charming and humorous way that two of groups left graciously but the last one continued on with their belligerence. 

I had ordered the calamari meal with salad and rice and my waitress was on her way to bring it to me, when one of the belligerent crew flung his arm in disapproval and up went my calamari and the salad and the rice and onto the ground.  Well, his group had a natural reality check and decided to start leaving so the waitress dealing with them corralled the group out of the patio while mine quickly went back inside to place another order.  Another waiter had come out with broom and dustpan and the meal was quickly cleaned up and the incident was over.  All three waiters worked so well together, it was almost like they had orchestrated this many times and not once did I hear them complain or be rude to the group that just left.  My meal was brought within minutes which I enjoyed thoroughly and I could go back to enjoying our wonderful city.  I was so impressed to witness such a fine choreography of events.

My only complaint at Ouzo is that I find the menu here a bit overpriced for the portion I have getting, I have eaten in Greek barrios in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto and have been served up huge portions for less prices.  

But Kudos goes to the staff of Ouzo!  No unnecessary breaking of plates at this establishment."
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"Okay I have survived one of my most amazing Calgary evenings with some new old friends at VIN's.  And although I have already raved about it, I need to rant more as this particular evening is worth sharing.

I enter the place, the warmth of the hostess is contagious as she takes my jacket folks and hangs it up for me. I join my friends who have already consumed half a bottle of Italian white but have just been served three amazing dishes.  A lobster salad, which is mouth watering, these babies are the perfect union of lobster meets delicious butter.  The duck, cut thickly and gracing a nice bed of corn and other veggies I cannot see in the glow of the candlelight, because I am aging. And a nice plate of ribs, grilled to perfection, all spooning each other on a plate.  I had already eaten a steak and prawns at home so I ordered the Vanilla Crème Brule but was not shy with my fork as I picked at their plates.  Of course we polished these dishes in no time!

The conversation was endless, witty banter, many explosions of laughter and gleeful yelling.  On the side  I ordered a.... hmmm and I have to double check this name of course ""Drink me cause I am sexy"", a nice white wine martini, with cranberry juice and lime, very refreshing and worthy of drinking because I AM sexy. These drinks, plus my friend's smoky but dry red wine glass, and my other friends Grand Marnier on rocks with a twist were soon accompanied by a cheese platter.  VIN offers little side menus as well as the bigger plates, you can choose from cheese, meat and fish, these are all nice little tantalisers at $5. 

Of course at this point another bottle of wine, now Italian red needs attention. Well the conversation grew thicker, and many times we would toast each other, the bartender and every customer in the nearest vicinity.  Lavish complements were poured out to our neighbouring tables and folks at the bar.  And pretty soon people were sitting with us, and of course, we all had friends in common in other countries and locations in Canada.

This called for a third bottle, my friend being a wine connoisseur in her excitement shouted out various wine names but the waiter said those were well over $200 could he recommend a more inexpensive wine but that had the same zesty flavour.  Of course!  

On the side, every alcohol beverage brought to us was served in the most handsome glassware, with the nicest visual presentations.  Our wine glasses were changed appropriately every time a new bottle came to the table in the most appealing crystal ware.  

Our waiter could have taken advantage of our now inebriated yet open states of being and brought us outrageously expensive wines yet he advised us of other affordable options. Simple details I noticed here folks.

Well the place was soon wrapping its gift up for the evening and our bill was presented to the table and keeping up with the high antics of the evening, we decided to play ""the price is right"" (Bob Barker would be proud). I guessed 4; my mates guessed high 3's, our bill for everything I just mentioned came to 2.5! Unbelievable, high quality food, endless cocktails and 3 bottles of imported wine. 

The staff had casually winded down and also sat with us and they were so friendly and gracious, it just made for a whole wonderful evening. I was brought my coat plus it was put on me, my god did the service ever end plus one of my friends covered the bill.  SWEET!  

This is an amazing place to gather with friends yelpers and although I don't want people to discover my new gem, I insist you must VIN it!"
-InhDRRVG7wrwsgAUvN4Qw,"If I could rate this store a -5 stars  I would. UNORGANISED and to top it off just plain RUDE RUDE RUDE.  

I presently work with an organization that does cultural events for youth in the city. One of my roles is to highlight youth in capacities of the arts and so therefore I am to oversee a huge art show at the Eau Claire market.

Our organization is fairly high profile, we partner with the Glenbow Museum, the Public library and the Calgary Transit just to name a few.  Our website gets 16,000 hits yearly.

I needed around 30 art eisels and wanted to commission a carpenter to build them for me but I cancelled that contract when i found out that I could rent them at Swinton's for 6 dollars an eisel a day.  Great deal 

So I called and booked 30 of them, and even called back two weeks later to confirm.  The girl reassured me everything was fine twice,so I was calm about this event.. well .... until.... just a couple of weeks ago when I get a call from another staff member from the store and am told that someone had double booked me.  

Basically the eisels were not available and they had no idea who had taken my call and who had booked me when it was plain to see in thier calender that the eisels were already spoken for.  I said how can a person reassure me twice about a date and a number on two totally different separate occasions and how can you not know which employee did this? A mystery still to this day and the irony is they dont have many employees.  Go figure?

This employee was very nice and was apologetic and he said he had at least 15 left and  that the owner would be willing to cover the difference if I ordered from another store and kindly gave me two contacts.  These contacts didn't pan so I told this employee that I would want what he had left and he suggested coming in to see other eisels they had that may compensate for the other ones.

So I did today.  The owner was not there but the co-owner his wife Donna was and she had no idea what I was talking about and yet again according to her calender I was not booked once again for the 15 eisels for that day.  

Again not only had they double booked me with the first request they had now overlooked me for the 15.  I thought its okay people make mistakes but  Donna's tone was so rude and bascially if she didnt know about it then obviously it didnt happen.  We finally got her husband on the phone and low and behold he confirmed the negotiation but he was not advised by the second employee about the 15 eisels.

At this point I am incredibly upset and I now only have weeks for my upcoming exposition. Donna says to me well ""I have 15 do you want them or not?"" in the most aggressive tone.  I was so taken aback at her snappy tone so I then said, ""listen your employees have made the mistake of double booking me and again I see I was overlooked yet a third time. I am irritated with all this , are you not going to help me your client?  I also add I dont appreciate your tone right now and you are being incredibly rude"". 

This does not even phase her with more zest she beligerantly carries on and answers "" I have 15 take it or leave it""   I am so in shock at the whole situation and this response and have never been treated so rudelyby a business ... but  yet I say yes I will take them because the kids in the show need them and ask if she could please email me the two other options once again so that I can perhaps retry to find the other 15.  It is now 7 hours after this request and I have heard nothing from her. Suprise suprise....

Tomorrow I will cancel the whole order simply out of principal.  The staff obviously doesnt communicate to thier employers the follow ups, nor do they admit when they have made mistakes.  The owner was trying to remedy this situation but his wife certainly needs to take a customer service seminar and perhaps deal with the public less.  

I still cant believe that this woman who is the owner of her store would treat a client in this way, doesnt she want business? Shouldn't she make ammends for the mistakes of her staff in a professional way? It still blows me away.  I have reviewed over 700 businesses in this city and I have never been treated in such an ill mannered way.

My board was not at all impressed with this store and we will never do business with them again plus she really picked the wrong person to lay her power trip on, the arts community certainly is going to hear about this...and needless to say so will the yelp community. 

So a big minus 5 stars for this woman and her non personal customer style and service.

This yelper's favorite art supply store still stands, Mona Lisa's art supplies; educated staff, superb service and very nice owners... and why shouldn't you have friendly experiences and service... THIS is the norm."

Lunch on a weekday wasn't too bad of a wait.  My toast was made fresh and out to me in less than 10 minutes.  Fresh ingredients and really picture-worthy dishes.  Though very niche with only toast on the food menu (smoothies and coffee as well), I do really like the flight of toasts where you get to choose 3 to sample.  I began with the lox toast.  The toast itself was a hard wheat (not a connoisseur on toast but that's what it seemed to be to me).  Lox was chewy and fishy and fit for a bagel; but still third best of the toasts.  My next indulgence was the beet hummus toast.  Really easy to eat hummus that didn't overpower you with the flavor of the beets.  Harsh cheese and a lot of salt from the toast actually complimented each other a lot to make this my favorite.  The avocado toast was as good as any in town.  Fresh tomatoes, sliced avocado, and again fantastic, heavy cheese.  A complaint of mine was that these dishes, although they look awesome, are simply impossible to eat.  There's no ""sandwich"" option so everything either falls off or gets all up in your face with each bite.  Tasty, but a fork and knife type of meal.

Restaurant itself is very clean and bright and relaxing.  Prices are high for a meal that might not fill you up, but the presentation is probably worth a little upcharge.  I paid a little less than $17 for my flight.  Overall a cool little spot.  Few outdoor seats and takeout somehow available (weird, as I'd think they want it to be presented a certain way and take out always looks worse).  The workers are very nice and are constantly out and about on the restaurant floor seeing if people need anything else which is nice for a minimal, casual-service restaurant such as this.  I would definitely come back, especially if the menu gets updated."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Upscale Chinese food is hard to master. Mr. Chow was fine but certainly did not reach the levels of upscale Vegas. It is competitive price wise and the portions are fine, but there was too much average in the meal. 

We ordered the middle prix fine meal as we were 2 people. We obviously wanted the Peking duck but no luck unless you're 3 people. This was very disappointing as this was the main reason I wanted to try Mr. Chow. On a side note, they really need to add a duck appetizer so I can try it or offer to 2 people. Instead we went with the beef pancakes, soup noodles, fiery beef, and velvet chicken , all accompanied with rice and mixed vegetables. The 2 memorable dishes were the fiery beef and soup dumplings. The beef was simply fantastic with just the right amount of spice and flavor. The soup dumplings were some of the best I've had and don't burn your mouth like many others. The velvet chicken was good but pretty bland in flavor. The beef pancake is a hard pass and the veggies were good but just Chinese veggies. Portions were unexpectedly filling and we even had some leftovers. The alcohol list was a real disappointment as they only had a few reds by the glass affordable and 1 rose. No beer and only a few cocktails, of which their old fashioned was way too sweet and low in alcohol content.  They specialize in champagne here but still they need to add to their liquor listing. 

Mr. Chow may be a top of the line Chinese establishment elsewhere but I don't think this location reached any heights. Very Americanized with no chopsticks unless upon request, but then very gimmicky with laminated menus. Unless someone else is buying, I won't be back. I do want to try the Peking duck, and that may have changed my mind on the overall meal, but their rules are rules. We did get out under $185 however which is solid for on strip dining."

District One is one of those places where it's hit or miss depending on the wait staff, time of day, and luck.  The restaurant itself is very hip when you walk in and doesn't give off that usual Asian sit-down vibe like the other restaurants in the area.  District One has a feeling of hanging out, and should be a go-to Happy Hour spot for some of the food.  Drinks aren't cheap though, so keep that in mind.

I had the meatball pho, pork buns, and chicken wings.  Meatball pho was just ok.  I know I should have gone for one of their flagship oxtail or bone marrow phos, but I messed up - shame on me.  The chicken wings had a nice kick but were all in all ordinary Asian wings.  The pork buns were amazing.  The bun, the meat, the filling, all top notch.  Come during Happy Hour for a great deal and get a few orders of them.

The complaints are long; if it wasn't for the solid food and the ultimate finale of our situation, I would have given 2 stars for sure.  First off, after being immediately seated in an almost empty restaurant at about 5pm, the waiter took 10 minutes just to take our order.  He brought over a different beer than what we asked for and then when we placed our order, it took 40 minutes to come out, all at the same time, not staggered as appetizers and mains should be.  Apparently the kitchen gave our order to another table which just blows my mind because no way somebody ordered our exact dishes.  But the worst part was that no waiter came by to check up on us during this 40 minutes without food, even with empty beer up to that point.  We ultimately just packed our appetizers in to-go boxes straight away and only ate the pho at the restaurant because we were in a hurry.  The waitress comped both appetizers, which is nice, but still doesn't make up for the previous 45 minute meal experience."

I came here on a week night at about 6pm looking for some good Chinese food.  Ping Pang Pong is located in the Gold Coast so I expected the price to be a bit higher than normal but was actually pleased as it was very consistent with other sit-down Chinese restaurants in town.  

The portions are very big here and very fresh.  They are known for their dim sum so I had to at least try some of their dinner dim sum to give a true review.  I had the pork buns dim sum, lettuce cups, and BBQ pork ribs.  Add in a few drinks and the bill came out to $44 after tax.  The pork bun was just eh.  I usually like the steamed bun but this came with a dessert-type of crust which caught me off guard.  Tasty innards, but not much going on in the way of a dish.  The lettuce cups were quite tasty and I actually recommend them as a nice appetizer.  Finally, the BBQ ribs were average - still can't find an authentic Chinese BBQ char siu in town.  The meat was good but not much flavor.  And the bone was so large that there wasn't much meat on each cutlet (though there were many ribs on the plate).  The dish came with some boiled peanuts which were a nice addition to the meal.  

Service was all over the place.  I'm not sure if it was busy or what but the waitress would disappear and then show up and take 6 orders before returning to the kitchen.  So your order wouldn't be placed immediately, rather you have to wait until her rounds were up.  Very weird way of doing business but the food came out quickly and we were in and out quickly after just waiting a long time to place the order.

Ping Pang Pong is good Chinese food.  I prefer local when trying Asian cuisine in this town so I won't be back, but if you are staying at Gold Coast or nearby and don't have a car, and are craving non-American Chinese, then give this location a try."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Really quaint venue that has a feel for brunch any day of the week.  Really open area with some seating out front and a bar (no TV).  We got seated quickly and got overwhelmed by the menu.  Tons of options from breakfast to brunch to lunch, all sounding fantastic.  I ended up ordering the frittatta with sausage on the side.  The food finally came out and was honestly pretty fantastic.  Frittata was made of egg whites but came out large and had super flavor; really nice-looking mushrooms and plenty of veggies inside.  The side of sausage had a crunchy skin and was cooked just to the right temperature.  The best part was the hot sauce selection.  Ghost pepper, habanero, and a few others that I can't remember.  My stomach was rumbling with happiness and water was a necessity for sure.  Kitchen Table Squared has their food and hot sauce game down pat.

The bad part, which knocks this review, comes from two things.  First, the parking is awful.  Even if you find a lot in the back lot, you need to walk all the way to the front rather than using the back door.  And the parking attendants love giving tickets as well.  Second, the service was oh so slow.  We were seated and order taken within 10 minutes.  Food literally did not come until 45 minutes later.  The waiter even stopped coming to our section and avoided eye contact towards the end of our long wait; three times he came over apologizing for the wait before that.  The manager came over as well two separate times.  In the end, all we got 20% off.  I think we shouldn't gotten a free entree or even a free monkey bread or the like to compensate for the wait, but I guess 20% is better than nothing.  

Kitchen Table excels at the food.  Prime spot for brunch, though not the cheapest with most dishes starting at $12 or more.  I would be back for a leisurely brunch, but I'll be prepared to wait."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"This review is for 4.5 stars.

Food was very good.  Have never had a good hainan chicken in Vegas besides the original Flock and Fowl.  Their new location may top that, making it more of an entree rather than a small lunch portion.  The hainan came with a seasonal veggie, fried egg on the rice, and a few dipping sauces.  The chili was probably the standout, but none of the sauces were must have.  We also had the laksa which was really a phenomenal dish. Everything about it was good.  Hearty portion, full prawn, thick noodles, interesting sweet flavor, and perfectly cooked chicken.  Finally, we had a few wings that we ordered extra extra spicy.  This was my one complaint as far as food went during our visit.  We ordered extra spicy for the laksa snd the wings and were left pretty unimpressed.  The wings tasted like sriracha and the laksa didn't have any extra spice.  Flock and Fowl has the food, but don't expect to sweat. 
 This place has an interesting cocktail menu and about 10 beers. Seemed like a full bar as well with a few wine options.  Prices are typical of the area with all around $8-11. 

Service was al over the place.  We had at least 4 servers total and they had no idea what was going on from the dishes on the menu, to what the restaurant specialized in, to the drinks behind the bar.  We ordered chicken wings to come out first as an appetizer and inevitably they came out last.  We ordered extra spicy and they at first came out half soy glaze half spicy, having to return and recook them.  After the hectic meal where we waited for 3/4 of the meal before eating, we ended up being comped a cheesecake that we didn't want.  Nice that they want to make it up, but erasing an appetizer price is a much easier and better gesture for us.  

In all, Flock and Fowl is a mainstay and great destination for food in Vegas.  Good for a dinner before Fremont, but service could use an upgrade."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Outstanding!  Shawn McClain never lets you down in Vegas.  I went on a slow Friday night and decided to sit at the bar as it was just me.  The place was really dead surprisingly and had a very relaxed atmosphere for a Friday night, unexpected for a nice restaurant at the Aria.  But the service was great and the waiters were very helpful in describing the most popular dishes and recommending cocktails.

I began with the steak tartare from the main menu (only $2 more than the lounge small bite menu; don't know the difference) and accompanied that with the infamous bacon bread and baguette.  The bacon bread truly is superb ad the baguette matches the French restaurants in the area.  The tartare was fabulous and is a must at Sage.  Pretty big serving size as well which I did not expect.  I then ordered the small plate scallops which was a half portion of the main entree for $25, as compared to $44 for the main entree.  Totally worth it and again a must order.  Best scallops I've ever had; I really wish there were more than two.  I definitely ordered the two best items on the menu in my mind.

On top of that, I tried the flask cocktail and the bartenders even let me sample some beers on draft.  I have to say, the beers were of pretty rare variety with Mikkeler and Cascade all throughout.  They were overpriced surely, but many of them would be hard pressed to find in the Vegas area, even at the top beer bars or stores in town.  But I do recommend the Flask cocktail if you like an Old Fashioned.  Very heavy alcohol taste but strong on the bourbon side.  And the presentation in an actual flask is pretty cool as well.

All in all, this was one of my top solo meals of all time in Las Vegas.  In and out in an hour and total bill came to under $70.  I imagine all the items on the menu are fantastic and the tasting menu is quite good as well, but I can surely recommend the tartare and scallops without a doubt.  McClain is a must in Vegas."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"My favorite restaurant experience of all time. Presentation and craft of all of the cocktails and food dishes was exceptional. With a modern twist to the ingredients and a true flair and artistry of the chef's presentations, in not sure there's a better place in Las Vegas to recommend for a meal. 

Bazaar Meat is located in SLS so maybe that's why it doesn't get as much credit as it should. Still it's a Jose Andres restaurant so you know it will be good. The venue is humongous and could easily host a convention.  Took about 3 minutes just to walk to our table.  The waitress came out right away, gave us a handful of menus, explained the cocktails and course options, and we were off. 

We began with a few choice cocktails from the menu. These were exceptional and each had its own uniqueness, whether it be salt air on the margarita or a smokey flavor on the Manhattan. We also tried the liquid nitrogen lemon drink, a super strong and tasty old fashioned, and a literally smoking mojito. 

We went with the $100 tasting menu and swapped out the olives for the foie grad cotton candy at no extra charge. Each meal came out with an explanation on how to properly eat/experience each dish. Most came with a signature dipping sauce as well. We were able to pace ourselves with the delivery of the food so we were definitely not rushed.  Our two and a half hour meal was full of 8 dishes with our added few side dishes. Each was delectable, with the standouts being the foie gras cotton candy, bread stick beef carpaccio, brussel sprouts, and a light meat dish with a signature truffle sauce. We ended with a platter of about 8 desserts. Each had a unique element like the food, including edible packaging for a candy as the top. Main meal was the better than desserts in my opinion, though that's not knocking the dessert. 

Bazaar Meat is my number one recommendation in Las Vegas as of this date. For a memorable meal from start to finish, come here and experience not just eat the food"
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"This is my final update as I have now experienced all that Andiron has to offer.  A true 5 star experience this time.  We started at the bar area for a surprisingly nice HH.  Until 7pm (very late for Vegas, they offer half off beer, wine, and specialty cocktails.  They also had $1 oysters all day on tuesdays.  The oysters were a little small but for a $11 and a great dipping sauces I can survive.  As usual, the cocktail I ordered, the Manhattan, was exceptional.  The wine selection was very nice by the glass as well.

We then sat down for dinner and ordered the appetizer, dinner, dessert option for about $40, plus a wine pairing for $10 extra.  The wine didn't really ""pair"" as we ordered two different appetizers and two different entrees and got the same white then red selections, but still for $10 and about a 4-5oz pour per meal (2 total), I thought it was a nice accompaniment.  The meal began with some fresh cornbread which was very good.  We then had the squash soup and caesar salad for appetizers, pasta and rib for dinner, and the donuts and lemon pie for dessert.  We also added brussel sprouts as a side, which although perhaps the best part of the meal, was overkill as the portion sizes are solid without ordering another side.  The salad was good, not great, but the squash soup was very nice and creamy; great for dipping.  Both entrees were quite good with nice sauces and big portions.  The desserts, especially the lemon pie, were outstanding.  The meal ended with a complimentary tart which was the best dessert of the 3 and just too small as it left me wanting more.

You will be thoroughly content and full after this meal.  Especially for the price, you can't go wrong with this tasting option as many of the dishes I was going to order anyways were options here.  Our only issue with the dinner was that we didn't want dessert but were unable to maneuver around the meal and either remove a dessert and add an appetizer, or upgrade an entree.  One of the best restaurants in Vegas."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Open only on Sundays, I was very excited to get a seating at Sterling Brunch.  Of course I went straight for the high value items like lobster, crab legs, oysters, and caviar; I tried everything though so I got a full feeling of what the restaurant had to offer.  

To begin, the lobster didn't taste fresh, though it was very meaty.  This applies to the crab legs and oysters as well - large but very mediocre quality.  The caviar was a nice touch and was salty and a hit at our table.  Popovers as always are tasty, but at a buffet, they're just fillers.  Filet was well overcooked, lamb was hard, prime rib was nice and tender, while the salmon was fantastic.  Salmon was the clear standout from the meal as far as entrees.  The banana foster french toast was quite good and rich and sugary, but kind of out of place, being one of the only brunch dishes besides eggs and sausage.  The dessert station was very week and wasn't replenished as much as I had hoped, with many times being out of lollipops and strawberries.  

Champagne is great quality.  They'll keep you filled throughout your brunch.  Add in some juice flavors as well to make it a mimosa or even go crazy and try a bloody mary.  However, when the brunch ends on Sunday, at I believe 3pm, it really ends.  They literally take plates off the table, turn off lights and shoo people out of the restaurant.  That service is poor and they need to make less of a scene when it comes to closing out the meal.

Service from the beginning wasn't that great.  We waited 10 minutes although we had a reservation.  And then they didn't even offer us drinks while waiting.  Popovers weren't that warm, and constantly we had to flag down waiters for utensils and water refills.

Sterling brunch is cool for a one time event, but at $100+ it's not worth it.  Food wasn't of the highest quality and service is as you'd expect at Bally's  Glad I tried it out, but not a must in Vegas, especially with plenty of other high end buffets on the strip worth more bang for your buck."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Really tasty food.  I saw many of the dishes as comfort Japanese fare.  They have about 5 varieties of takoyaki and 3 okonomiyaki with everything from octopus to foie gras.  Paid in Full seemed to specialize in small dishes as well, with corn, Brussel sprouts, and udon fries to name a few.  Then they also had about 5 large plates that were enormous enters, for under $20.  Price-wise Paid in Full excels.  You can fill up on a few entrees to share or get about 4 tapas, and you won't hit $40 (without drinks).  The drink game was fine with a couple interesting Japanese varieties like an imported Japanese IPA and a boxed sake.  

I had a few boxed sake and really was impressed by how smooth it was and just the niftyness of the packaging.  We also had the special sausage pasta and garlic yakisoba.  The pasta was as good as any neighborhood Italian.  I was expecting more fusion, but this dish was just a quality rendition of spaghetti and sausage with some mushrooms mixed in.  The yakisoba was fantastic.  So much garlic, but not enough for the smell to uninvite.  The pork belly was melt in your mouth consistency and the mushrooms were perfect additions to the dish.  This was one of the better dishes I've had in a while, coupled with the nice take-out presentation.  The Brussel spouts were fantastic but unfortunately they took about 30 minutes.  I had assumed they would be a starter, but they ended our meal as a dessert.  Lemon and some chili, but charred to perfection.  The dish was mainly just leaves rather than full Brussels, which was very interesting and enticing.  The full meal left us with lunch and a half to bring home.  The total bill was about $65 with 2 entrees, a side, and 3 drinks.

Every dish we had was above par.  The menu has some dishes like the takoyaki variety, corn dogs, and udon fires that I've never ever seen or heard of based on my dining Vegas.  Paid in Full is a small restaurant and service is oh so slow as they are extremely under staffed, but it's definitely worth it for an interesting take on the cuisine."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"One of the better farm to table, ethos-promoting restaurants on the strip.  The cuisine was a little of everything and a complete menu.  They had a bunch of seafood options, but then also had the typical steaks and chickens.  Then they had some very approachable vegetarian dishes to try.  The portion sizes were small but the quality was there for sure.  You could really see the freshness of the ingredients on each plate.

Our meal consisted of the harvest salad, brussel sprouts, octopus, and eggplant.  The harvest salad was perhaps the freshest salad I have ever had.  It looked as if the beets and lettuce were brought straight from the farm to my plate.  Not much flavor going on in the salad but quality was awesome.  The brussel sprouts did not disappoint.  I always order a side of brussel sprouts if the menu has it, and these were charred to perfection and had that nice flavor of the crispy leaves which fell off easily.  The octopus was interesting.  I was expecting a calamari dish but this was a grilled octopus that tasted remarkably like chicken.  Then there was some chorizo on the plate with flavors meshing well.  I liked that dish but i wish it was larger as there were only 4 pieces of octopus; not easy to share and feel content with the dish.  The eggplant was good, not great. It was a little too cheesy and not enough going on in the dish.  Tasted very similar to an eggplant parmesan but nothing remarkable.  We also had some cocktails which were both tasty but very weak.  Not worth the $16-$17 price point when there was barely any alcohol in it.  

The prices are strip prices for sure.  They do have a Happy Hour from 9-10pm at the bar where you can get half off cocktails and some snacks.  Not the best Happy Hour menu but a good price for a cocktail pretty late in the evening, albeit a weak one.  Not sure I'll be back here because I like more flavor rather than freshness to my meals, but Harvest is truly one of the top 3 farm to table restaurants on the strip.  If this type of cuisine calls you, then go big and give Harvest a try."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Kabuto is as good as it gets in Las Vegas. From the service to the precision to detail this place checks off all the boxes. Kabuto is a tough reservation as they only have two seatings in about 25 seat restaurant but definitely keep checking back. Kabuto operates on a prix fixe matte with additional a la carte options if you're still hungry. We opted for a couple of the $120 Kabuto options and a couple $80 middle options. The main difference I noticed was two extra sashimi, and an additional uni, nigiri, or oyster in each course. The deal is pretty good compared to just getting the middle and ordering those items on your own. We also had a few sakes which ranged all over the place. But there are 10oz options in the $30-40 range and $70 options in the 24oz range. 

The meal was a little over 2 hours but once it gets going there isn't much downtime. The order of the dishes is a little weird with miso soup at the end but no matter each course was fresh and perfect. We began with a fresh, in house sake to clear our palettes. We then were given tremendous amounts of tuna, yellow fish, clam, uni, roe, and many more for the next hour or so. With about 5 varieties on each plate throughout the first couple of courses it's tough to detail each, but some standouts were the uni and roe and some passes were octopus and crab salad. We ended the Emma with some black sesame panna cotta and cheesecake. Both solid but after so much food honestly unnecessary and unneeded as the quality didn't match the intricacies and precision in flavor of the previous courses. 

The entire meal was well worth the money and could rival any Japanese tasting. At $120, the deal is ridiculous. I wouldn't be surprised if you find this identical meal for $300 in New York with 3x prices on sake. Kabuto has been on my must try list for the past two years. Been a long wait but now I'm craving more of the most freshest foods you can imagine. Each has a story and an origin of where it's from and how prepared. Truly a remarkable meal and perfect for an introduction into fine Japanese cuisines or simply just a seafood lover."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Off The Strip barely earned this 1 star.  The whole meal consisted of problems after problems.  I came along with two other people after they did some research and recommended this restaurant.  They had heard the burgers were very large (enough to share) and we looked on open Table and it said the burgers only cost $13 each, making it a great deal.

To begin, we got menus and the burgers cost $15. Different from the online menu, but still an okay deal if sharing among them so they got a burger.  It said it came with coleslaw and fries.  They ordered it medium rare.  I ordered a burger for myself with chips.  When the burgers came neither of us got coleslaw, though when we checked the menu again it clearly stated the coleslaw should have been included.  I asked about this and they took my entire plate away, burger, chips, and all, and came back with the meal again including a fourth of a cup of coleslaw.  Also, their burger was clearly rare, with the inside bright red and the juices seeping through and ruining the bun.  The burger tasted alright on my end and was in fact very large, but the ciabatta bun it was on was so flowery that I couldn't take a bite without my entire face turning white.  

We got through the meal and got the check, and it stated that the burger costs $16.  Not $13 like Open Table said, not $15 like the actual menu said, but $16.  We complained and the manager simply changed the price to the original $15.  He did not apologize or comp us, he just took off $1 to bring it back to the listed price.  He then came over after we asked for him and we explained the entire, awful dining experience.  He didn't apologize or comp us, he simply said they were updating their system and prices.  He offered us a beer on the house but  at that point we just wanted to get out of this place.

They got a one star because their burger was large and the craft beer selection was above average.  They do not know how to cook burgers, they lie about their prices (probably charging every single customer $1 more than listed), and they have awful customer service.  Do not come here!  Go to any one of the other 4 or 5 bars in the Linq area instead."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"This review is for 2.5 stars.

I really wish the service was better.  Coming to Hash Kitchen, it had everything I could ask for in brunch - mimosa varieties, bloody mary bar, tons of dishes, and dog friendly-patios.  Once we arrived on New Year's Day, and the line was about 20 groups deep at 12:30pm, then we knew were in for a morning.  

We finally got seated about 30 minutes later.  Outside as we had requested.  So far so good.  Upon seating, it took 20 minutes and 2 separate times of requesting service just to get our water glasses.  10 minutes later a waiter comes out to serve us.  We get our meal in and we're off.  Solid mimosa flight comes out immediately so we can at least get boozing.  Daily selection of 4 fruits, with the blueberry and kiwi standouts.  30 more minutes pass until our food comes.  I ordered a hash skillet with corned beef and side of sausage.  I had requested sweet potato hash, but apparently our waiter said that the chef 'couldn't find' the sweet potato hash so no go.  Undercooked corned beef hash and overcooked sausage let to a below average meal.  The frittata the person I dined with was hefty and loaded with egg, but not much more than a hungry man breakfast.  Although, the biscuits are a must if you do happen to go to Hash Kitchen after this review.  We finally got our check and left after almost 1:45 meal time.

The best part was that everybody in our section was complaining one after another.  In the entire time we were there, we saw 4 different waiters serve a total of 5 tables outside.  One couple left after a few bites as they were so fed up.  Another table complained at least 4 or 5 times before a waiter finally served them.  And then there was a larger couple of about 15 that waited for the entirety of our meal just to be seated, with almost a dozen tables opened, yet unbussed, inside.  All the while the manager is sitting at the podium, definitely not managing this comedy of errors.

A fiasco of a brunch with just average, hit or miss food.  The drinks were good and the atmosphere of Hash Kitchen was so good coming in, but the service was just so mediocre that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth for any chance of dining in the future."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"This review is for 3.5 stars. 

There were just a few things that made our meal a little lackluster. This could be preference rather than Piero's fault, but I'll lay it all out regardless. 

First off, they only do valet parking. They have no self lot so either Uber there or have a few dollars on hand. Next, they have no cocktail menu. The waiter says order whatever you want and the bartender will make a fine version of it, but he came back with an awful Manhattan and Old Fashioned which tasted just like whiskey dumped into a glass with a random cherry or orange, respectively, as a garnish. Some of the worst renditions of a cocktail I've ever had. Strong but definitely not worthy of a cocktail price. Next thing that happened was that the specials were given before we received our menus and listed about 15 which I couldn't really register as there were too many. It's a little overwhelmed for when you throw out all the specials and don't list prices or ingredient listings or anything. 

The food itself was pretty good. The bread was a great French bread and the garbage Caesar salad was a really solid rendition of a Caesar that included tomatoes, avocado, and shrimp (is it even a Caesar salad anymore). This is a great salad and can easily be split or taken as a meal if it's own. The osso bucco was top notch, fall off the bone, deliciousness. It even came with some bone marrow which complimented the French bread perfectly. The side of creamed corn was a nice touch as well. It's sweeter than usual though so beware. The accompanied pasta was just average in the osso bucco dish but you get the dish for the meat not the side so no worries. The mushroom pasta special was very lackluster. Very soft sauce and again the pasta was just fair. The mushrooms were good but there weren't enough and too small to recognize. 

Price is pretty steep as well. Most pasta dishes ranged high $20s or low $30s with the meat dishes around high $40s. I think Piero's is one of those romantic locations that you come if you're on a high class vacation or at a convention and on your employer's dollar. But as a destination for the a regular evening out for good Italian in Vegas, it does not even crack the top 10."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"I don't usually go to AYCE sushi restaurants because of the stigma of low quality.  I always get the feeling that quality is diminished when the restaurant is just churning out sushi for all of their hungry customers.  So I came to JJanga wanting to try the food, but not for the AYCE deal.  

I ended up ordering a la carte, which actually offers some solid prices at $3 for appetizers (small portions but wide variety and tasty), $3 normal sushi (california, tuna, etc.), $5 rolls/burritos, and then $8 for specialties.  AYCE was $25 so considering I stuck with a few minor rolls and appetizers it wouldn't have made sense anyways.  I got the mushroom ball and agedashi tofu appetizers to begin, and then the spicy tuna roll, yummy vegetarian roll, and Jjanga burrito.  The appetizers were of high quality but for $3 were very small.  The spicy tuna came with 8 pieces, so although it wasn't the best roll I've ever eaten, and not the cleanest prepared, the price was too cheap to say anything negative.  It was solid. The vegetarian Yummy roll was very good.  Tempura and a nice spicy sauce for a good kick.  The burrito was an interesting concept but nothing to shout about.

I do have some comments about the restaurant.  To start, wasabi was a $1 extra charge.  This is a sushi restaurant so that was very weird, although they brought out like a full ice cream scoop when ordered so that makes up for the surcharge.  They also have no liquor license, yet advertise sake and beer both in their menu and on their wall in the restaurant.  Next, the waitstaff had no idea what they were doing and we had 3 different waiters take our order so we never really had that server experience or have a personalized waiter to request stuff from.  And finally they messed up our receipt.  The price was the same as what we ordered so we didn't bother complaining, but they replaced two different sushi items on the receipt that we did not order.  So either they ned to update their cashier system or take better order noted to cite the price correctly.  

I'm not a fan of AYCE, as I said, so I probably won't be back.  But they have a huge variety of sushi (albeit most consist of the same crab, tuna, avocado, etc. ingredients) so if AYCE is your thing, then $25 isn't horrible and the quality is fine for the experience."

I came for a nice business lunch hearing about the prix fixe meal available during the weekdays.  The menu cost $28 and included an appetizer (seafood salad, minestrone, mixed plate, or caprese salad), an entree (lasagna, branzino, pizza) and then a dessert (chocolate, gelato, lemon cake).  We went with the caprese salad and lasagna for one person and the minestrone and branzino for the other.  We then shared a lemon cake and got coffees as we weren't feeling dessert at that point.  There all also options to supplement the meal with either bigger portions r better dishes, but we opted for the basic.

Overall the minestrone came with tons of veggies and the branzino was well cooked.  I was full at the end, especially with the complimentary white bread.  The lasagna was a very interesting, thinly layered variety that was quite tasty while the caprese was just your typical of that dish.  The lemon bar was very nicely crafted and exceptionally tasting.

My biggest complaint was the waitstaff.  They firstly upsold us with garlic bread when we already had regular bread.  We assumed it came complimentary but we saw otherwise when we received the check.  Second issue was the supplement pricing.  The branzino and the pollo dish we were both interested in were $29 on the lunch entree menu but the pollo dish cost an extra $8 on the lunch prix fixe.  This seemed a little weird and the waiter didn't really have an explanation when we reacted to the pricing discrepancy.  Finally, the waiter very poorly gave us alternative options when it came to dairy constraints.  I prefer not to have dairy and the only dessert offered was gelato (non-dairy?  Really?), which I don't eat, that met this criteria.  The only substitute was coffee.  I'd rather have another appetizer or price change to the menu, but I guess that's not how it works.

After a full meal it ran us about $65.  There are definitely better priced options on the strip even for lunch but with a romantic view of the fountains and quality food for the most part, Lago is a suitable option.  For a romantic or business occasion that is easy to appeal to people with all tastes, Lago is great (if you can afford it).  For a typical Vegas lunch when staying on the strip, I would go elsewhere and save your money or a nice dinner."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Service was a little slow at times and music was a little loud, but that doesn't take away from a truly great brunch.  Large portions, everlasting bellinis, and truly no rush.  

We went for a noon brunch and left around 4:30pm.  You heard that correctly, a truly everlasting brunch for 4.5 hours and constantly getting refills.  We were never judged, never shunned, and always had full glasses.  Stupendous service.  We sat outside and there really wasn't any of a crowd considering it was primetime Sunday.  We ordered the breakfast nachos and the loco moco (beef with eggs and rice).  We wanted to take a different route with brunch this time so stayed away from the typical omelette or benedict.  The nachos were very good - soft yet not damp.  The beans and runniness of the eggs really gave it a nice flavor and the dish spiced just to our liking.  The loco moco was a very interesting dish as rice is not my first thought when it comes to brunch.  It came with a freshly prepared wagyu steak and 2 eggs over a bed of rice.  The beef itself was perfect and the sauce was a tasty thick sauce; perfect to start the morning.  Add in some fresh bread and we were in heaven.  The bellinis were super strong and always fresh.  I liked the strawberry-yuzu better than the peach, but they allow you to go back and forth so no worries if you can't make up your mind.  And we ended with a nice raspberry cheesecake with mango sorbet.  A perfect, filling meal.

The waiters were great at giving us privacy yet still knowing when to be heard.  The only issue there was the process of getting extras such as tobasco sauce or a new napkin.  The process always involved multiple waiters passing along the request like telephone so it did take a few minutes longer than normal.

We sat out on the deck which was perfect as the weather held up nicely.  There was a DJ who had the music on a bit too loud, but it wasn't STK volume just a little too high.  It is outside near the pool so maybe they just set the level and leave it there all year even when the pool is closed for the season.

One of the best brunches in Vegas hands down.  And it's also a nice change from your typical French variety brunch.  Still has an upscale, loungy feel with great food, but a nice change to the menu offerings.  Give Herringbone a try if you are a brunch fanatic."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"This review is for 4.5 stars.

We came to Hakkasan during Restaurant Week 2018. We each had the $50 prix fixe menu with an additional appetizer apiece.  We also began with a bourbon (big pour) and a Japanese Old Fashioned (more fruity than boozy, but very strong and tasty).  

For our meal we began with the hot and sour soup and the duck and foie gras in sesame wrap.  The hot and sour soup was just a very high scale, great rendition, but nothing surprising.  The sesame roll was fantastic.  Soft skin, crispy duck, and though only a tiny spread of foie gras, oh so delectable - a must try appetizer.

For our dinner we had the vegetarian and the Hakka dim sum platters.  Each was presented in a very instagramy way and each was prepared to perfection in a soft, thin wrap, with tons of meat inside.  The veggie platter had a fake duck and chicken that tasted like the real thing, while the Hakka, focusing more on seafood, was fresh and thick and crunchy.  Perfect opening dish.  For the entree, we had the szechuan sea bass and the rib eye.  Sea bass was the real deal.  Easy to cut and a real Chinese, upscale dish.  The rib eye, as expected, was cooked to a chewy goodness, in a very dippable merlot sauce.  The rib eye did come with some unappetizing fried noodle, but given that the fried rice accompanying the meal is fresh as you can get, I didn't worry too much.  They also had a chili dipping sauce from the dumpling that was so good and gave just enough kick, that we even kept it to use during our entrees.  The carrot cake was unexpectedly good.  A Chinese restaurant offering carrot cake was interesting to say the least, but their rendition with a coconut ice cream on the side was very good and a nice palate cleanser to end the meal.  

Restaurant Week strikes again and Hakkasan did not disappoint.  For $50, we would have definitely felt satisfied.  Adding on a few appetizers and drinks, we were stuffed.  My only complaint was that the dessert, the carrot cake, could not be substituted, although we both got Restaurant Week menus.  In the future, I think they should be able to substitute to let the entire table try other dishes if you all order the fixed menu.  The place gets quite busy on Friday and Saturday nights, so even with a reservation we had to wait another 15 minutes at the bar.  But other than that, fantastic meal all around."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"What an outstanding brunch at STK.  I came during restaurant week so the menu came priced at $30 with options from starter, entree, and dessert sections.  The choices were kale salad and salmon bites to start, brunch club sandwich, pancakes, and prime rib hash for entrees, and cookies and milk or donuts for dessert.  We decided to try as much as possible so we each ordered differently, excluding the pancakes.

We began with a complimentary champagne and the bread basket that came with an icing dipping sauce.  Unique bread offering, especially giving it a dessert feel to begin and end the meal.  The portions are enormous at every stage of the morning.  The kale salad was easily a meal on its own and as good as it gets.  The smoked salmon crackers with cream cheese had a full fish with the amount of lox they plated.  And these were just the starters.

The club sandwich came with plantain-like sweet potato fries and four double decker cuts.  The avocado was a great addition to this dish.  The prime rib hash came with a couple of poached eggs and some hash browns underneath with a nice sauce.  Out of those two, I would recommend the hash, especially since STK is still the Cosmo go to steak house, brunch or not.  But both are great options and enough to take home for a meal later in the day for sure.

The dessert - just plain ridiculous.  The donuts come 6 to a plate and are just well made, fresh offerings.  The milk and cookies (get this dessert!) comes with a medium sized vanilla milkshake (one of the best I've ever tasted), and 10 cookies.  Ours included gingerbread, chocolate chip, and powdered.  I believe it is based on chef's choice though.  Their dessert game is spot on from the opening bread to the ending platter.  I usually don't order dessert at restaurants, but I am really glad I came during restaurant week to experience this treat.

The atmosphere in the restaurant itself is very clubby with an active DJ during the 11am-2pm brunch time.  It didn't seem like a too crowded restaurant for brunch (maybe Eggslut's opening was taking some buzz) but it really should be.  I will most definitely be back to try other brunch offerings or for dinner to stuff my face once again.  It's not your typical high end, classy joint ambiance-wise (prices are on par, however), but still a fantastic meal.  Portions unbelievable and definitely a sweeter alternative for brunch in town."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Really good food and but expensive, though considering the view and the placement within the luxury shopping center of Bellagio, not too bad.  Spago offers all sorts of cuisines on their menu, but seem to lean towards Italian with 4 fresh pastas on the menu.  

We shared a few appetizers and each had an entree.  One thing to note is there isn't much vegetarian shown on the menu. so you have to customize the courses yourself if you don't eat meat.  We began with half dozen oysters, smoked salmon pizza and tuna tartare.  Complimentary bread was nice with about 4 options, so gotta love the starting the meal off right.  Spago pizza of course is a must order.  Rich ingredients but the pizza could have been cooked a little better as it was more bagel-like than Italian pizza.  But salmon roe and salmon combo can never go wrong.  Tuna tartare, another Spago specialty, was perhaps the best I've had.  Fresh avocado on the bottom and great chips to hold the tuna.  Oysters were extremely small - full of flavor but tin.  Not worth it for $4 per oyster unless you absolutely require them.  For entrees we got a vegetarian spaghetti, lamb bolognese, crispy branzino, and veal chop.  Pastas both fresh and hand made, but very boring.  Spaghetti just simple pasta and red sauce and bolognese just meat sauce and agnolotti.  Tasty but small portioned and more of a lunch dish.  Veal chop is a winner here.  Full meal with veggies, potatoes, and bone in chop.  Cooked well and tender.  Branzino flaky and skin a home run.  On top of a bed of kale, this entree is a pretty healthy option if you want to save room for dessert.  Speaking of, we had the lemon spike and the chocolate souffle.  Lemon tart was extremely sour when you hit the lemon, but a very interesting dish from presentation to the layers of lemon flavor.  Good to look at, but not quite what I was expecting.  The souffle was an outstanding version of volcano cake, to compare.  Hot chocolate sauce and a hazelnut-type of ice cream made this perfect for a cholate lover.  

Spago offers solid food in the heart of one of the best hotels on the strip.  We had a seat near the window and got to experience the fountains right next door with the music in the restaurant synced to the fountains.  Really great view that adds to the experience.  Waiter was extremely intrusive and over zealous, but still the meal was a great option for Vegas locals or newbies, alike.  Puck is a consistent stalwart in Vegas for good reason."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"I went for Restaurant Week 2017.  When restaurants give you a tasting menu to sample their menu during one of these experimental events I always expect to overpay and leave wanting more.  Yes, I will probably experience many of their most popular dishes, but at a minimalistic portion size. This meal was $40 for dinner and 9 courses.

The first few courses were exactly as I expected. I began with a very lackluster jijama-wrapped guacamole that was barely a bite size.  This was followed by a small shumai, although known for, seemed absolutely average.  The dumpling layer is cooked in-house which I respect, but the dish itself wasn't as good as many dumpling houses in the area.  The meals began growing on me though from the two starters forward.

The next dish was the tuna ceviche spoon - absolutely amazing.  I'm not sure how many come in a typical serving, but this dish looked beautiful and tasted even better.  There was so much going on in only a spoon-sized portion.  This was my favorite dish of the night. The next offering was the refreshing palmitos salad closely followed by the chicken taco.  The salad was a very nice palate cleanser with palm and grapefruit and came as in a considerable portion size that would rival a typical salad starter.  The taco was cooked very well, with the notorious guacamole that China Poblano is known for, but not a must have.

Next was one of my top choices of the night - the golden pig.  Delicious pork belly filling with a hard bun.  I was expecting more of a steamed bun so I was caught off guard when I was served this bun, but still a very good dish.  The inside was fantastic and the outside with a dessert type of coating was very refreshing.  The final two dishes were the fried rice known across the strip and the shrimp mojo.  The shrimp had a little kick a very nice garlic sauce, but the size was very small.  The fried rice, on the other hand, was two times as large as you'd expect.  20 vegetables (I didn't count but there were a lot) and fluffy sticky rice make this dish a must.  After this meal I took home my leftover rice and easily I can make a meal and a half.  The dish was perfectly cooked and when mixed was perfection.  The night ended with a very tasty ""mango sticky rice"" for dessert, though it seemed more whipped cream than mango.  Good, but I'd rather get full on the main dishes than the dessert.

I really think the Chinese side of China Poblano outshines the Mexican.  Besides the ceviche, I enjoyed the bun and rice options much better.  The prices are high at this restaurant but know that Jose Andres rarely disappoints."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Nobu is a very Vegas appropriate dining experience.  The menu has the huge caviar and also fresh cuts of nigiri for those looking to splurge. The rest of the menu is a well curated menu of a mixture of Latin and Japanese with some ceviche and dipping/chip items as well as classic seafood and tempura. Coming on a Friday night without a reservation was bold as the place was packed, but we found some room at the bar and dined there. The waiter gave us the low down on their famous dishes and the menu in genera and we were off. 

The beer menu is pretty much Japanese through and through. Mostly lager but a few Hefeweizen as well. Prices were high at $9+ regardless of Draught or bottle. The cocktails were reasonable at $17. I had the Japanese old fashioned which came premade and barrel aged. Super strong and boozy but a nice rendition. I would order that again as it fit very nicely with their menu as a whole. 

For food we tried a few entrees and an appetizer. We began with a quick tamago by were disappointed. Looks cool with the 'Nobu' charred into the top, but more of a cake than any egg flavor. The appetizer we went with was the classic sticky rice. Supremely innovative dish with dippable sticky rice cubes topped with salmon. 10/10 would order this again. Couple this with housemade hot sauce and it was a winner. Waiter didn't tell us how to eat this dish in the beginning though, as there is a certain way to indulge, so make sure to get the 411 before chowing down. The sea bass with miso was good not great. Miso is their specialty so we had to order it. The fish was outstanding and thick and flaky. The sauce was just too heavy on the yuzu which took away from the flavor of the fish. But still a very nice entree. The king crab tempura (recommended by waiter) was not as expected. Typical of most lower end Japanese establishments you expect a large full on crab with deep fried legs and whatnot. This came precut with the crab meat lightly battered and in a bowl of tempura sauce and some onion that was more of a ceviche than a classic tempura. The crab was absolutely phenomenal and thick. This dish was a great order and the tempura cooked heavenly with just a. Soft fry to make it more enjoyable to eat without he overpowering crunch. 

Nobu impressed me. Definitely worth it to get a reservation as it seems to always be packed whenever I walk by.  Stick to the actual Nobu menu and stay away from the sushi and high end extras that are just there for those looking for a sushi restaurant on the strip. Go to their main menu and let the waiter push you towards a delicious dining experience."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"My whole experience at Beauty & Essex bounced back and forth from being exceptional to awful all throughout my meal.  The staff really tried hard to make up for the problems I experienced, but there's only so many times and so much they can do before you question things. I still greatly enjoyed my meal but it was filled with errors all night long. 

We came at 10pm on a reservation but weren't seated until 10:45pm. Considering we had a reservation, that's fairly ridiculous. I do understand they can't seat us until a table is open, but don't offer me the reservation option in the first place then. It's an easy thing to honor.  We were offered a free drink ticket to compensate us for the wait, however, which was a nice touch. 

The food and drinks were very good during the meal. To drink we had the woodsman (bourbon based, little too sweet), the electric avenue (strong, old fashioned type, very good), and the bubbles and berries (fruity, boozy, great). To eat we had the tomato tartare, sliders, fish tacos, and ratatouille. Here's where the biggest issue came - the pace of the meal. The only explanation I can think of is the kitchen forgot about us. The tartare came out fast enough. It was exceptional; it was one of the better dishes I've had in Vegas actually. It had a sundried tomato taste with a small runny egg on top. Our next dish, the fish taco, came out literally an hour later. The fries on top were exceptional while the actual taco was just fine. The sliders were quite nice and actually an ok deal at $8 each. The ratatouille came last, a little out of order if you ask me, but was very good. I wish it came out wth the sliders to make that a full meal but whatever.  The presentation of all the dishes was a nice touch. 

Because we waited so long for our food we were again offered free drinks and dessert. The staff was really trying to make it up to us but at that point it was getting kind of funny that our meal just kept getting wrecked and fixed nonstop. So in the end we tried the donuts and root beer float. I would say the donuts in chocolate sauce were great but the float and the rest of the sauces were a pass. Very good coffee here as well. 

So after a good meal and all the free drinks and dessert, the meal only cost $75. That's a ridiculous steal even after a 3 hour atypical food excursion. I would come back because I really think they were having an off night and they deserve another chance. They do try to make it up to you if they mess up so I appreciate that, but my advice is, as a customer, give yourself time, don't make plans right after the dinner, and expect a long meal."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"Can't recommend Partage enough.  Each course is actually fairly priced and larger than you'r expect from a tasting portion.  Ingredients are top of the line and presentation is picture-worthy.  Based on advice from a former diner, we opted to have some appetizers and shared large format rather than tasting menu.  For a group of 4 we had 8 appetizers and 2 large format entrees.  This was well enough for 5 people even.  And then with the additional great dessert, we were stuffed.  The entrees are easily 3 people worth and appetizers are a typical appetizer size.

We had the lobster bisque/ravioli, the cold pea soup, the caprese salad, and the quail to start.   We then had the whole fish and the rib eye for main course.  The lobster bisque was absolutely fantastic.  Huge ravioli with actual chunks of lobster in a soothing, milky broth.  This is a must order dish.  The pea soup was refreshing and had  cool liquid ice freezing presentation, but didn't have oomph to it flavor-wise.  The caprese salad was interesting with a mozzarella foam and a bread crumb bottom, but if was just too gastronomic for my taste buds.  You could take all the flavors but it looked like an ice cream sundae so it's tough for your brain to get around.  Interesting but I'd opt for another.  The quall was well worth the $10+ price tag.  A few legs of quall and a nice slice of foie gras.  Additionally plated was a mushroom base. Really nice opener.

For entrees, the whole fish was a branzino.  They show you the cooked fish which is humongous and almost calzone looking.  But in the back they debone it to a more reasonable, 2-3 person offering of delectable fish.  Nice lemon sauce and tons of carrots and fennel accompanied this dish.  The ribeye was cooked medium rare and was just a nice slab of meat.  Pre-cut into squares and accompanied again with eggplant, carrots,and potatoes.  The sides were the biggest sides to an entree I've ever seen and were a nice veggie addition.  

Dessert consisted of a peach custard dish, a vanilla cheesecake, and a shortcake type of dish.  The peach dish was the best in my opinion just because of the uncanny resemblance to a real peach, but none of the desserts really stood out.  Tasty but none seemed like Partage staple.  The cocktails are solid at under $15.  I had the smoky old fashioned which comes in a smokey box to really give off the smell.  Truly one of my favorite old fashioned in a while.

Partage is tremendous value in a city of luxury. Tough to park and weird location, but open the door and be transported to a culinary vacation.  Great service and really nice venue make this restaurant one of the best new things in town.  Another hit from this culinary team and worthy of a second trip to try the tasting menu."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"This review is for 4.5 stars. 

Morimoto food is just fantastic. Their ability to fix mistakes could use some work but they definitely tried. This review is only under 5 stars because of the back and forth service quality. First, we reserved teppanyaki table for 6 about 2 months out to make sure we had placement. They saved 5 seats for us only, leading us having to wait 15 minutes for them to bring over a bar seat that was 3 inches higher than everyone else with no space on the side of the table. Then, the menu was just very confusing with the a la carte and teppanyaki experience and the waiter didn't do a great job of explaining. Still we got a few free items for our wait which all but makes up for it. But 2+ hour dinner for just an entree seemed excessive. 

As stated before, everything I ate was ridiculously tasty. For our wait we received free salted edamame and sticky ribs. The ribs were some of the best I've ever had and just fell off the bone. The edamame was just a nice opener. No spices, just salty. I also ordered an absinthe concoction that was perfectly leveled with alcohol taste but enough fruit flavor that was perfect for a Japanese meal. 

For entrees, as a group of 6, we touched just about everything. We had a few rolls, asparagus side, few duck fried rice, and spicy green beans. Of those, the rice was good but more a pilaf than fried, with not enough duck to make it worth $14. The green beans had no spice but simply a Chinese sauce similar to an XO. Asparagus would be my pick for our best side. About 4 large asparagus, sliced into perfect sizes, in some tasty sauce. 

For dinner a few had filet, 1 lobster, and 1 chicken cooked on grill in front of us. I had the miso cod. From what I rated, the lobster was fantastic and the standout. Really grilled and sliced in half so you get to enjoy it all. Filets were just a nice steak, worthy of any Japanese steakhouse. Chicken was cooked interestingly in front of you with the smoking style, but not a must. The black cod was fantastic, especially at under $40. Unfortunately it didn't come with sides as most things are a la carte at the restaurant, sans a few veggies or dipping sauces for all. If you like miso sauce, this dish will blow you away. Strong flavor and so much sauce, so make sure you get a side that's suitable for dipping because the sauce is unbelievable. 

Considering this is Vegas strip restaurant, especially at the overly-expensive MGM, Morimoto is very affordable. Entrees at about $40-60, sides under $15, and drinks under $20. I would highly recommend Morimoto for any meal - special occasion or just for a nice vacation meal. The teppanyaki is not a show you would expect at chains, so I would recommend reserving a table and just getting a good meal instead."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"My meal at Chica was all but perfect...until we got the check.  We came during Restaurant Week and added on an additional appetizer to truly taste everything Chica had to offer.  For our meals we had the empanadas and tacos to start, chicken and cuban sandwich for entree, and the donuts.  We also added an order of corn lollipops.

To begin, the empanada was very good.  The shell was cooked perfectly and the ground meat was heavy, but flavorful.  The tacos were one of the better upscale tacos I've had in the area.  Corn tortilla was starchy and hot and the insides were overflowing with pork and veggies.  The corn lollipopps were different than I'm used to.  These were more of a cheesy, lime flavor, while most I've had have steered towards heavy chili flakes.  But overall very tasty and a neat presentation with the corn husk, perfect for eating the ""lollipop.""

As far as entrees, both were huge and easily could have filled up anybody, without the additional appetizers we chose to order.  The chicken was a basic rotisserie, but had some fresh chimichurri and purple potato salad to make it a meal.  I wouldn't necessarily order this dish myself, but it's nice for a basic, chicken lover.  The cuban came full of meat and had a harsh horseradish sauce that was perfect for the meal.  Bread was buttered and toasted perfectly to make a great dish.  Fries were good with a nice spicy seasoning, but nothing too overpowering.  The final desert course, the donuts, were phenomenal and a must order.  The donuts themselves are warm and topped with powdered sugar, but every sauce on the plate was worth a dip as well.

The downside of my meal came when I went to pay.  The waitress would not accept my ""free appetizer with purchase"" coupon that I received from the Grazie desk.  The only reason I ordered the extra appetizer was because of the coupon.  The waitress seemed well overwhelmed so called over the manager to discuss.  The manager eventually came out, angrily explaining the reason was because the Restaurant Week menu was a ""special"" and would not qualify as a purchase.  Instead of simply comping us for the misunderstanding, she all but yelled at us and would not take the appetizer off our check.  After explaining the situation for about 5 minutes, she finally caved, condescendingly saying ""sir"" about 30 times during our encounter and reiterating that Chica is owned separate from the Venetian/Palazzo and reserves the right to not accept coupons if they feel like it.  

I understand the policy, but what is the cost of an appetizer?  I wasn't trying to steal - it was a misunderstanding.  Management should always be on the customer's side, and her attitude was unacceptable, even up to the point where she reluctantly comped $10 worth of food.  She brought our experience from a great 5 to a ""we might not come back here,"" regardless of the quality of the food.

The food was great and the service was pretty solid.  Meal does take awhile, however, as our lunch was well over an hour.  My only complaint was the Manager.  But can't fault the chef for front of house rudeness."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"The price is steep, but the quality is the best you can possibly hope for in Las Vegas.  Stepping into the restaurant is so unique.  On either side of the opening you have a Cirque show and slot machines, then you walk into a prestige, clean area with all waiters wearing suits.  Not the biggest area with only a few dozen tables, but very cozy and well groomed atmosphere with chandeliers and real flowers on the walls.

The food was high quality French.  Each dish of the degustation seemed very seasonal and had a chef's tough with either the design or cooking technique to give it the taste or texture desired.  The best part of any high dining experience is that the chef will recommend an order or a way to eat the dish.  This means the chef expects a reaction not the dish and in my opinion makes it better than just an entree and dig in, while mixing ingredients not intended for each other.  But there are too many dishes to discuss from the degustation as it's about a 17 plate tasting with extra desserts and bread.  

The bad parts to begin the review.  Firstly, the chef's insistence on asparagus.  They were in about 5 dishes either in soup or grilled form.  Never added any taste and the flavor overwhelmed.  The pace was extremely slow as well.  With a tasting such as this, I expected a new dish to come out every 10 minutes or so.  Instead, Robuchon would bring out 3 dishes at a time, and then expect you to wait 30 minutes for the next - poor structure.  Bread service should have been nonstop as well, only when we asked for more were we brought.  Finally, the vegetarian tasting was absurdly basic.  About 7-8 of our dishes between regular and inveterate were identical.  The other vegetarian dishes were just more of the same vegetables with only a couple memorable items such as tempura tofu and ravioli.  Otherwise, you were just eating side vegetable dishes all night with no high end additions such as caviar or foie gras.  And not to mention, this is the same price as the regular.  The price obviously is high and expected so I wouldn't put it as a negative but just a choice - buyer beware.

The good were all meats.  From the entree steak to two separate lobster courses, to a strong scallop - all were delicious.  Foie gras and caviar gave it the high end feel, as did the smoked salmon.  The bread was very good, especially with the amount of selection and the fact that they heat it up for you upon ordering.  The dessert was out of this world in terms of flavor and beauty and selection, with the tasting menu's signature dessert more or less a jungle of different flavors.  Also, being a birthday or anniversary type of venue, they are always prepared to have something special for you if you let them know ahead of time  The wine list can get high, but honestly wasn't absurd with many options in the price range of a regular steakhouse on the strip.  $50 corkage fee is a great deal as well considering the price point of the meal.  And a goody bag to go with a nice pistachio and fruit cake is always a fantastic touch.

The experience was great and I would never take that back.  And looking at the regular menu, you can easily come for a $200 tasting and get a great fancy meal.  Robuchon is high class in Vegas and a once a year type of dining.  Food was great and hit every tastebud I was hoping for.  Very glad I had the opportunity to dine here."
JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,"This review is for 4.5 stars. 

Let me just put this out there - the food is phenomenal. Artistically prepared and portioned well in the 6 course tasting where you come out stuffed and yet get a full glimpse into the chef's repertoire. 

I had the signature tasting and the person I was with tried the veggie tasting. We began with a bottle of wine as well. The meal began with wheat and sourdough rolls which were fine, though I was disappointed that we were not given the typical pre-dinner course at most tasting restaurants. 

The veggie courses included beets, asparagus salad, tomato soup, pasta, Japanese plate, and an apple pie. Of the plates, the tomato soup really stood out. Poured in front of you onto fresh bread, tomato, and even marshmallow, this was a great dish. The pasta was also very tasty with a nice lemon breeze to the dish. The main course, the Japanese, underwhelmed a bit as it was more fusion tofu with a tonkatsu taste rather than authentic as expected. Still every dish was fine. 

The signature tasting is what you come to Michael Mina for. The dishes included caviar parfait, tuna tartare, fish, lobster pot pie, wagyu with foie gras, and a smore with root beer float. This tasting will get you stuffed for sure. You will taste some of the best ingredients presented with a French flair. This tasting really is exceptional so each dish deserves an explanation. The parfait came with a salmon and cream cheese base with caviar on top. Eaten together the warm was of the salmon with the cold caviar was fantastic. The tuna tartare was crafted in front of you and had a very nice Asian taste that adds to the typical raw tartare you see at most restaurants. The fish was a pass as it was simply a breaded variety of fish. The lobster pot pie is what the restaurant is known for. Very interesting dish that is worth ordering as you won't find this anywhere else. The fact that a mini version of the flagship dish is included in the tasting while the main dish is $85 on its own (albeit 5x larger) makes the tasting worth it. The wagyu beef and foie gras was the best dish for me. Perfectly cooked meat, melt in your mouth foie gras, and plenty going on on the plate. Fantastic main dish. The dessert was actually quite surprising as the smore wasn't a typical graham cracker model but rather burned into a caramelized igloo. Solid choice if looking for a shareable dessert. In order, the wagyu dish was best, followed by the tartare, lobster pot pie, parfait, smore, and the fish taking the rear for the main courses. But 5/6 were fantastic which is rare on the tasting menus. 

My main qualm was the wait staff. This sometimes happens at the higher end restaurants in Vegas where 1 waiter gets 10+ diners in his area while another gets about 3. So we never see our waiter and then we see the other standing around all meal long. Also, our waiter really ambushed us with the menus in the beginning and didn't bring our bottle of wine until the first dish was served which was poor on him. Our wine also had some issues and had to be traded out for a different bottle and we were not given an apology or discount or anything just a new bottle 15 minutes later. 

For the price of $128 for the signature and $99 for the vegetarian, it's an affordable upscale destination restaurant in Las Vegas. The signature menu really takes care of the entire menu and showcases all of the best parts of Michael Mina's cuisine.  This is a great restaurant food wise but I think their customer service could use some work when it comes to making the customer feel wanted in the restaurant. The total meal is about a 2.5 hour experience with the tasting but that's what you want when you go for an event type of dinner like this. Definitely worth a go if you want a great tasting meal but you don't want to drop more than $250 per person."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"More than adequate staffing level at present, all chefs/cooks visible in the kitchen speak Japanese, the menu is possibly unique here in Las Vegas (aside from the sister restaurant Kabuki).  The minimalistic ambiance of this small restaurant just works for me. And if you want to photo-document your meal, sit at the ""pasta bar"" counter, the lighting there is adequate for simple food photography needs.

So Down to business.  A group of Yelpers were actually at the plaza where this new restaurant is located at last night (Monday), which is currently their only day off.  So I decided I was going to check them out the next evening after work.  As the chef, possibly the owner, handed us their business cards and a few menu (he was at the restaurant with a few others).

When I arrived at 7:30pm on Tuesday, the place had 4 tables occupied already, and I am pretty sure that everyone there, except yours truly, was a native Japanese.  I considered that a positive indicator for seeking authentic Japanese style rendition of Western cuisine.

The menu is pretty simple, pastas are on the specials board, while appetizers,salads, chef's special dishes are on a 2-sided menu. The dessert menu also offers some Western desserts with a Japanese twist. Menu prices are mostly in the $teens, but can quickly add up to a meal costing $30-40+ per person.

On my inaugural visit, I tried the Miso Carbonara for main course #1 and Kurobuta Tonkatsu ""Nakamura-Ya"" Style for main course #2.  

The  Miso Carbonara pasta dish was good, the flavor is obviously different from traditional Italian Carbonara pasta dishes, but the sauce was creamy with a mild flavor.  I personally would prefer the pieces of bacon to be cooked a bit more, but that is a personal preference of mine.  Check out the picture I posted if you are interested in trying out this item. Flavor: 3.5 stars. Presentation: 3.5 stars. Value: 3 stars.

Since I was still hungry, I went and ordered the Kurobuta Tonkatsu ""Nakamura-Ya"" Style from the Chef's Special Dishes portion of the menu.  It is a very delicious and juicy tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) that is served with a tomato sauce, an asparagus and a button mushroom cut up as garnish.  The only thing I thought was missing was a starch component to the entree, like rice pilaf or something.  Then again, maybe the roll that is served with the meal is meant to serve that role.  Flavor: 5 stars. Presentation: 3 stars.  Value: 3 stars.

For dessert I had the Soy Milk Panna Cotta ""Okinawa Black Sugar"" Sauce for $5.95, but the Black Sesame Blanc Manger also looks very interesting on the menu.  The Panna Cotta was pretty good, I like the flavor, although the texture seems a bit firmed (like too much gelatin was used) to me. However, the Okinawa Black Sugar Sauce was the key component that makes this dessert.  The dessert is probably prepared by savory chefs, as some basic pastry chef attention to detail was amissed (utilized sprig of mint that had clear signs of pest feeding on the leaf as a very noticeable garnish just seems careless, and something that can easily be prevented). 

Anyway, I like this new addition to the Las Vegas restaurant scene, and can see myself paying the occasional visit when I am in the mood.

Location: In the same plaza as Raku, Monta Ramen, Big Won, Soul Oak Korean BBQ.  Very accessible if you are near the Chinatown area.

Parking:  3/5  Could easily gets crowded, but not filled to capacity where you have to look for nearby street parking.

Ambiance:  4.5/5  I like the execution of the interior decor and the lighting (dim in the main dining area, and well lite at the ""pasta bar""counter.

Service:  4.5/5  Pleasant service by a small squad of friendly waitresses.

Value:  3.5/5  Not a cheap meal, but I do think you get what you pay for, plus there is not much competition for this kind of cuisine in Las Vegas at the moment.

Flavor:  4 stars overall, some dishes and items are executed better than others.  But the balance of flavor that is not too overpowering, and compliments the components of the dish is what will make you go back for more.

4 stars!  Bravo and welcome to Las Vegas Trattoria Nakamura-Ya!!!

Note:  They do accept AMEX."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Dropped by after finding out about this new ramen and teriyaki restaurant via Yelp. From all of the anime characters outside, one might think that it is a video or anime or comic store, but it clearly has ""ramen & Teriyaki"" after Anime. The restaurant is still in its soft opening phase of operation, so business is still relatively slow and there is a 25%off soft opening promotion.

When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by two uber cute and very cheerful waitresses.  The place was empty, but nicely decorated (although the waitress said it looks like a pho restaurant - a nicely decorated new pho restaurant) with many anime paintings or art works on the wall, so I basically picked where I like to be seated.

The menu has a comic strip look to it, a nice touch.  

After checking out the menu, I opted to try Karaage Chicken Wings and Tonkotsu Ramen. The chicken wings were fried perfectly, but it was served with ketchup, which I thought was untraditional (chicken karaage is also traditionally boneless).  I think a simple wedge of lemon would have been a better choice.

The Tonkotsu Ramen (they source the ramen from the same purveyor that supplies Monta and Big Wong), but the noodle was not prepared as well as those served at Monta on my 1st visit. But I also don't think they hired a ramen chef directly from Japan either. For now Monta's ramen is still better than the ones served here.

Finished the meal with Tempura Ice Cream.  It is a good size, not the small ones served at the AYCE sushi places. But the waitress told me to try their Honey Toast, which she said was not as sweet as the ones served upstairs at Ichiza (I could not remember if I ordered that there or not, but will see about getting this on my next visit).

Ordered the Tom Yum Chicken Ramen (9-18-11) and the ramen was cooked a lot better tonight.  The broth was yummy and maybe a 3 spicy level. Different waitresses, not as talkative but still very pretty, so still a positive experience.

Decor/Ambiance: 4/5  Definitely sticking to the theme, although there are still a lot of room to go in the decorating department, such as Anime-related items as decoration on the tables (under a sheet of protective glass of course), photos of cosplayers that dine at the restaurant, anime figures, etc.  Even some of the waitresses are dressed in maid outfits like in some Anime, although some only donned anime-colored wigs and graphic tees. 

Service:  4.5/5  Very friendly, energetic, and attentive. (I definitely gave an extra star for this, although your mileage may vary depending on the waitress, your youthful good looks and AXE application)

Food:  3.5/5  Some items still need fine tuning, but that is to be expected for a new restaurant in the soft opening phase.  Would suggest serving more soup in the ramen, lemon wedge or alternative dipping sauce for the fried wings, serving the ramen WITHOUT the spoon already in the bowl.

Alcohol:  Will be on the menu once the proper licensing and other requirements are in order.

Price:  2.5/5  All items are under $10. Ramen (san the 25% soft opening discount) is priced higher than Monta, but comes with 1/2 shoyu boiled egg. Personally I think at the 25% off price, it is a competitive Japanese casual comfort food dining spot, but a harder sell without.

Value: 2-3/5  Not going to win any Best Deals in LV awards, but will not break the wallet either.

Location:  5/5  Very centrally located in Chinatown, not that far down the street from the Palazzo, Wynn, and Treasure Island. Just downstairs from Ichiza and a few doors down from Yagyu.

Parking:  You've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do ya punk????

Final thoughts:  This could possibly be a great ""wotaku"" hangout in Las Vegas or just a nice friendly place to chill out and watch whatever Anime they happened to have on at the time. Waitresses are definitely the friendliest I have encountered around LV.  Have yet to wait for a table, and the place is larger and seats more people than Monta.

Note:  Accepts debit cards and only MasterCard at the moment, which hopefully will change after Chase card processing is also approved.

As of Oct 3, 2011, there are no more 25% grand opening discount."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Daisho Sushi is a moderate drive away from me (located in a large strip mall on the corner of S. Eastern and E. Warm Springs), but after making my way across town to try out their Dinner AYCE sushi, I am definitely a fan and considered the drive here well worth the effort for good food.

As the restaurant is still relatively new, they were not all that busy tonight (plus it was raining, and you know who people here shy away from driving under such precipitous conditions). So after being seated at the sushi bar, it was pretty much just me and Michael K here at the ~70 seats capacity sushi restaurant giving their menu a taste drive.

We started off with the usual limited to one per person orders: 
Uni, Sweet Shrimp and Blue Crab nigiri, they were good.  

We also gravitated towards their APPITIZERS section, and had ordered:
* Salmon Collar (the salmon was so tasty and naturally fatty, it was amazing, like having ""Kobe"" salmon) and Yellowtail Collar (cooked just right and I really enjoyed it with and without the accompanied ponzu dipping sauce)

* Yaki-tori (skewers): Bacon wrapped Enoki Mushroom, Bacon wrapped Quail eggs, Bacon wrapped Asparagus.  At other restaurants you can order just skewers, paired with responsible consumption of beer and sake and call a great night out.  I really enjoyed these.

* Shrimp Bomb (it is like the Jalapeno popper with shrimp and crab, but without the jalapeno).

* Miso Black Cod - tasty!  Insane in the membrane that this is in the AYCE line up!!!

* Tuna Poki - the poki are prepared to order, not something that was made hours ago and left marinating in the cooler.

* Yellowtail Poki

SPECIAL ROLLS:
* Star Fish (No Rice) made with Yellowtail Tempura, Daikon and wrapped in Tuna, finished with Wasabi Oil, Ponzu and Scallion.  (Recommended)

* Johny Roll (No Rice) made with Crab Meat, Shrimp Tempura wrapped in thin strip of cucumber and finished with Spicy Yum Sauce.

* Wild Fire Roll (No Rice) consist of Tuna, Spicy Tuna wrapped in Soy Paper, topped with Albacore and finished with Garlic Sauce.

* What's Wrong Roll (recommended by Chef Michael) made with Shrimp Tempura, Soft Shell Crab, Green Onions, Masago, Spicy Yum Sauce, topped with assorted fish and finished with Screaming Orgasm Sauce.

I could totally put away more food, but I have an appearance to make at Bacchanal the next day and thought I take it easy and just finished the meal with some Fried Banana with Ice Cream (it was a nice finish to the meal, but nothing that blows me away).

Totally satisfied and very impressed with the food we were served tonight.  There seems to be a handful of new sushi restaurants opening in Las Vegas recently, and most have had positive reviews thus far. So if the other freshmen sushi restaurants are as good as Daisho Sushi (which I now easily considered in my top 3 Las Vegas AYCE sushi restaurant list), the rest of the old guards will have good competition to keep everyone on their toes.  That is good news for all the diners out there.

Note:  Aside from AYCE sushi, Daisho also offers a la carte items for lunch and dinner in addition to their lunch and dinner specials.  And dinner starts from 4pm until closing.  Pricing are very competitive for AYCE (especially lunch, which does not seem to have a reduction in the selections available).

About the Chef: (kernels of knowledge gleamed from small talk during our meal)
Chef Michael is from New York. His parents own a Japanese Ramen, Yaki-tori (Japanese skewers) and Sushi restaurant there.  So even before moving out to Las Vegas and working as one of the sushi chefs at Blue Ribbon Sushi (inside The Cosmopolitan), he was already familiar with the competitive restaurant business. So finally opening Daisho Sushi here in Las Vegas, just seems like the natural path of progression for this passionate young chef in a new city he now calls home.  (Haha, I sound like his autobiographer).


5 stars!  But as words spread and more and more people learn about Daisho Sushi, and the restaurant undoubtedly gets busier, I hope they can keep up with the projected increased interest in their restaurant and the food they serve.  Good luck Daisho Sushi!!!  And I will definitely be back and bringing friends to tryout the amazing food I had earlier tonight."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"1 Star for Jinya Ramen!?!

Are you effing kidding me? You nasty troll and probably a delusional Trump fanboy with horrible taste!  

That's probably what y'all Yelp regulars be thinking, but I am sadly as surprised as you are outraged by my contrarian rating.  If only the food served was as tasty as the hostess is beautiful to admire, without holding the quick furtive glance too long and risk turning it into a creepy stare or as well executed as the interior design.

Let's start with the good stuff and then all the other surprisingly bad experience I just had at their newest Jinya Ramen Bar Southwest location that just literally opened 4 days ago (Monday, Oct 29, 2018).

What I like:

Very convenient and nearby location next to a Starbucks that I go to way too often.

Decent amount of parking spaces.

Super cute and friendly hostess.

Cool mural.

Familiar menu.

Limited Happy Hour menu for dine-in customers only.  Be better if to go orders are not discriminated like non-European immigrants under Trump's administration.

Now, sadly the bad:

Whoever the chef is that is in charge of this new location needs to step up his or her game.  The expediter that is in charge of orders going out, especially to go orders, needs to check the QUALITY and ACCURACY of orders leaving the kitchen, which was a fail in my first eagerly awaited first experience here.

Took 25 minutes to finally get my to go order (3:43pm the order was placed and 4:08pm when the order was given to me in their Jinya paper bag). It was 4:10pm when I looked at my phone to check the time while I was still in the parking lot, so not exaggerating the long and ultimately disappointing wait. I literally had enough time to take a photo of the nice mural and edit it and upload to Instagram, take a quick restroom stop, and still managed to finished 3 hard level games of Sudoku. And the restaurant is not packed with a long waiting list of people waiting for a table.

Ordered their limited time Chef's Special, $18 Goku Midnight Cowboy, plus Pork Chasu and Salad combo, but didn't get the salad (didn't realized this until I took the 3 containers out at home, with 2 containers for soup and ramen and toppings and the 3rd for the epic failed Pork Chasu Bowl).  The smokiness of the ""tender braised beef brisket"" in the Goku Midnight Cowboy was just too much (over smoked or much too liberal use of liquid smoke, as the exalted Alton Brown might say ""It is not Good Eats"", I definitely would not recommend it even if priced like the rest of their ramen offerings.

The Pork Chasu Bowl was literally the worst I have ever had in my entire life.  Was it prepared by some Art Institute Culinary drop outs too afraid to let the chef know that they burnt the pork or it took 15 minutes to round up the left over bits to complete my Pork Chasu Bowl order? Whatever the reason, it would be an embarrassment to even allowed this super crunchy and overly salty fried small diced pork chasu to be served as a ""family meal"" to the kitchen staff, much less to an actual paying customer. If this was served to me while I dine-in in the restaurant I would send it back! And I can count the number of times I have exactly done that with just one hand.  Plus, my Pork Chasu Bowl looked nothing liked the photo uploaded by the owner to Yelp. Not the color or the size of the chasu or even the texture.  Definitely got ripped off on this ~$5 combo upgrade for this and the missing salad.

As a take out or delivery option, the wait time and poor execution is just not worth the trouble, even without the delivery convenience upcharge and associated unpredictable delivery lag.

I really do enjoy the Jinya Ramen Bar location on W. Flamingo, and introduced it to a few of my non-Asian coworkers, and they've all liked it, but this new Southwest location need to get their act together before that's ever going to happen.

I will give it another shot, but if it fails again like my to go order today, then I rather give other ramen spots in this area a try or stop by their West Flamingo location after work and give this location a wide berth.

1 Star for the food and excessive wait time.
1 Star for not checking to make sure the to go order was complete.
5 Stars for eye candy hostess.

P.S. The bathroom is fairly clean."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"First of all, just wanted to thank Amanda M for turning me on to The Little Kitchen Cafe, which is a cool little restaurant that serves popular Taiwanese food and desserts.

They have been opened for almost two months, but I must have been avoiding Chinatown Plaza, as I was completely clueless about this new spot to get decent Taiwanese comfort foods and various shaved ice and snow ice desserts.  It is operated by Taiwanese business owner and staff, so it is an authentic Taiwanese restaurant biz.  Most are probably not professional wait staff with years of experience, but they are friendly and courteous.

On my first and currently only visit, I only ordered 3 items, so I still have a lot more of their menu to explore.  

1.  Pork Nugget Rice Noodle. This is a popular comfort food in Taiwan, which I usually have at least once when I go back to Taiwan.  The flavor is familiar, and I would say that it is decent, but only because I have tried it from vendors/restaurants that are known for serving the best in Taipei or the entire island country.  But without having to fly across the Pacific or at least driving to Monterey Park, this is not bad.  Portion is large.  Price seems high for the item, but you get a lot of it.  Good for sharing with others family style, so you can try more things.

2.  Pork Crispy Roll - I like the crispy exterior of this roll, but again it is just average appetizer for me. Hitting the best of the best for this item in Taiwan has ruined me!

3.  Milk Snow Ice - correct texture.  Just for that it is already superior to the imitation snow cream at Kuma just down the street, supposedly invented (just like Al Gore invented the Internet) by a local celebrity chef that has since moved himself to SoCal.

Snow Ice (7 flavors), Taiwanese shaved ice, and smoothies plus toppings for dessert. ($3.75 - $7)

--- 7/22/2013 Update---
Went with a group so we could ordered more items to split family style.  They were very accommodating and the food came out pretty fast.  Almost too fast for all the foodies to take pictures of everything we ordered before portioning it out to everyone.

All the rice dishes were served with Taiwanese pickled napa cabbage (similar to the Korean kimchi, but done in a day and without the fermentation process), hard boiled egg simmered in soy, minced pork.

Pork Chop Rice, a traditional bento box offering for travelers back in the days (20-30+ years ago) that were traveling by train or bus across the island.  It was pretty good, and I would order it again.

Taiwanese Style Sausage:  Good, but I prefer it to be cooked a little more for a slightly crispier exterior.

Spicy Wontons - good, but we all agreed that it could be spicier.

Minced Pork over Rice - Very popular Taiwanese comfort food, but also very hard to make really good.  This version is okay.

Salt and Pepper Chicken.  This is the Taiwanese version, and it is more like popcorn chicken with Taiwanese style salt & pepper seasoning.

Fried Rice Noodle.  Another traditional dish that is popular in Taiwan.  This is a good item to order for sharing with a group.

Matcha Shaved Snow + Red Bean.  A traditional flavor combination, and it was decent.  The green tea flavor is not as pronounced as Frost Bites (their version is king).

Peanut Shaved Snow + Boba.  I liked the roasted peanut flavor that was infused into the milk before the mixture was frozen. Boba was alright.

Blueberry Shaved Snow.  Texture was creamier than the rest, almost gelato-like with a ""grape"" flavor.  Nelson Q suggests having this with the Peanut Shaved Ice, to make a PB&J flavor combo.

Taro Shaved Snow + Taro.  Mild taro flavor from real taro and boost from taro powder (that color is just too purple to be all nature), but I think most will agree that this is the only item where people will prefer powder-base flavoring over all natural.

Mango Shaved Snow +Mango.  Pretty good. I like the big pieces of mango, although we had some that were still semi-frozen when this made its way around the table back to us.

Based on the above, I think they get a 3.5 stars.

P.S.  The AC issue mentioned in previous reviews, was resolved by the time of my visit.  

P.P.S.  Not friendly for American Express card holders.  And there is a $10 minimum for paying with the credit/debit card."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Very excellent taco shop serving up yummy, made with love, authentic street tacos south of the border right here in Las Vegas.

OperatingHours:
M-Th 9am-2am
F-Sat 9am-4am

I am pretty adventurous when it comes to food, and will try most things at least once plus willing to make the trip to get it.  So after spending too much time in the school library and still needing to find a good late night spot to eat, I somehow found the Yelp reviews for Tacos  El Gordon on the East side of Las Vegas.  The reviews were all positive, and the pictures posted helped cement my decision to drive 40+ blocks down Charleston to find this tacos heaven.

The place was not difficult to locate, as it was a corner unit facing the E. Charleston Blvd.  The restaurant is well-lit inside, with modest décor but the tables, side garnish and drinking fountain stations are spotlessly clean. Even at 10:45pm on a quiet Wednesday night, the lines in front of the ordering counters seem to swell and ebb like the motion of the distant oceans.  Luckily most here are old pros at ordering the tacos and the lines moved quickly.  Even though I felt like a tourist visiting Mexico here, the friendly gentleman at the Adoboda station greeted me warmly with ""what can I get you my friend?"" and helped me translate their fairly straightforward and simple menu, he even helped my placed the rest of my orders at the other station when he was done fixing up my two Taco de Adobodas.

By the time I was at the cash register, my red plastic tray is brimming with 6 tacos (2 Adobodas, 2 Asadas, 1 Chorizo and 1 Lengua), a plate of the grilled scallions and roasted pepper and a cup for their bottomless Horchta ($1.40) all for just under $15.  Pretty sweet deal for what many reviewers are saying as very authentic Mexican street tacos.  I am no taco expert, but a restaurant filled with paying Mexican and Hispanic patrons is a great endorsement and what I look for when seeking a taco shop like this.

Tace de Adoboda - (""Shepherd's Style"") Spicy pork with adobo seasoning slowly roasted like, and shaved off the rotating skewer into the freshly prepared homemade hot corn tortilla and topped off with the sauces, onions, cilantros.  I enjoyed this the most.  5 stars!

Taco de Asada - Basically a carne asada taco with the regular fixings.  Taste was just okay for me, the portion of beef was generous but I felt it was a tad dry.  3 stars.

Taco de Chorizo - Made with the firmer chorizo and not the kind that melts into a poodle of grease and spices.  Others don't seem to care much for this taco, but I thought it was good.  4 stars!

Taco de Lingua - The ""tongue"" taco.  I really want to like this more, but it was just a little salty for my taste.  Otherwise the portion of the beef tongue was also generous.  I will still give it another try.  2.5 stars.
The grilled scallions and roasted pepper was good and the lady behind the counter really filled the plate for me, even though I only needed like  of the scallions.  I might have used more if the scallions were chopped up, but I will chalk that up as being the traditional and authentic way it is served up at the street taco carts.

Oh yea, the tacos here are not big and can be disposed off easily in 3-4 normal bites, but at $2 each (plus tax) and with the generous meat toppings, it is a still good yummy deal.

Décor:  2/5  Very modest, but you are here first and foremost for the food, right?
Food:  4/5  Overall, very pleased with the tacos here.  If it is closer to me, I will likely be here at least 1-2/week, alas that is a lot of traffic lights to drive through at 35mph.
Service:  5/5  For a low cost and unpretentious restaurant, the service was friendly and fast.
Cleanliness:  5/5  There is something to be said about how the staff here keeps the busy front of the restaurant area spotlessly clean.  Very nice!
Parking:  3/5  May not find the closest parking spaces but there are many in this strip mall.
Location:  3/5  Located in probably not the best part of town, but it is in a location that is surrounded by the bulk of their targeted demographic and on a heavily traversed street no less.  Perhaps a bit out of the way for those living on the West side of the 15, but the drive wasn't too bad later in the evening once the traffic dies down.

4 Stars!"
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Disclaimer: This review is just for the much hyped, limited time Holiday and Chinese New Year, dim sum brunch for $68.88, before tax and gratuity.

I only just recently found out about Wing Lei, First Chinese restaurant in the United States to earned the coveted Michelin Star, limited time holiday dim sum buffet from my foodie friends Facebook chat. Sadly I would just be finishing work, had I not opted for overtime, on Saturday at 11am, when the group decided to go. 

I was salivating just living vicariously through their perfectly manicured and curated collections of videos and well-lit photos on Facebook and Instagram following their victorious visit. So I asked which of my Vegas friends was down to go on Sunday or Monday, when my work schedule is more accommodating. Long story short, we ended up going on Monday, Dec 31, 2018.

By the time I arrived at about 10:35am, there was already a decent line, that stretched just to the corner. Which was not a problem, as everyone already there would be seated when the restaurant officially opens at 11am. While we were in line waiting for the restaurant to open, two hostesses took this opportunity to get the party size and last name, and we were also informed that there will be a limit of 90 minutes dining time today. That's a new rule.

From reading the Q&A on Yelp regarding the holiday dim sum brunch, I was really looking forward to the Peking duck. But from other friends experiences over the previous days, learning that not one of them stopped by when Peking Duck was served, I kept my expectation about that fairly low. It was a wise choice, as again Peking Duck was not available as part of their brunch menu offering. Roasted Duck was available and made their rounds on the dim sum carts.

At the carving station, instead of Leg of Lamb, Bone-In Prime Rib was served. It was very expertly and deliciously prepared in the traditional Western preparation. In any other dining situation, this would have been the celebrated crown jewelry of a festive feast. But this is the Dim Sum Buffet, so sadly this deliciously juicy beefy course was spurned to leave room for the tower of Lobster, Giant Prawns, Snow Crab Legs, and other items served buffet-style in chaffing dishes.  

I tried my best to sample as much of the entire available menu. But I completely skipped the sushi bar station completely. No regrets.

What I enjoyed and would recommend:
*The Steamed Sea Bass - fully cooked, but still juicy and flaky.
*Pepper Steak - reminds me of Pepper Steaks served on sizzling platters, but these beef are so tender and obviously made from a higher quality grade of beef.
*Crispy Skin Pork Belly - perfect crispy skin and nearly impossible juicy pork.
*Earl Grey Dessert - good flavor, not too too sweet.
*Bone-In Prime Rib (if available)
* Dessert station looks beautiful. Definitely take some pictures to relive the experience with virtual calories in the future.

These were decent: 
*Foie Gras Brioche - served on little plates with a nice glaze and juicy fresh blackberry.
*Strawberry Sudachi Roulade (Dessert) - beautifully presented.

Not impressed by:
* Chilled, boiled or steamed Lobster Tails - not much flavor, and in definitely need of flavor rescue from the Louie Sauce. (My friend that went on Friday thought boiled lobster is a cop out) Fancy it up by preparing Chinese style or Vietnamese style, or at least have these sauces on the side.
* Overall Dim Sum offering: I have had better dim sum at other local casino dim sum restaurants. And of course these can't compare to the popular dim sum restaurants in California that managed to stay in business more than a year.
* Xiao Long Bao - If it needs a mini foil tin to keep it together, it is not prepared by experienced dumpling masters. Some H-1B visas should be reserved for these master chefs, as the United States already have way too many European Pastry chefs, and indentured servant software engineers.

Overall, it was just okay. Is it totally worth the $85 per adult after tax and tip? Not really.

Also all beverages are extra and no free refills.

Service was good. Staff were all friendly. Glad I can check this off my bucket list, if I ever get around to making one.

Any who, HAVE A HAPPY NEW YEAR everybody!

*Wish this would be rated better for a personal milestone 600th review."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Friendly cashier: ""Welcome to 7 Leaves Cafe, sir. Are you ready to place your order?""
[Me, still squinting at the menu mentally debating on what to order... finally]
Me: ""Yes, I will have a large ice with an add-on of... your House Coffee.""
Friendly Cashier: ""That will be $4.60 plus tax. Would you like to add anything else to your order? Boba or Aloe Vera?""
Me: ""Yeah, I also want a large ice with Assam Milk Tea""
Friendly Cashier: ""Will this be for here or to go?""
Me: ""To go please.""

Okay, that might as well have been how I popped my 7 Leaves Cafe cherry 6 hours ago.  Mind you, the temperature was a biting high 30s F or low 40s F, which is one of the coldest days we've had this uncharacteristically warm winter. 

Yes, I know they are still in their soft opening phase. So I shouldn't be too brutally harsh. But if there was still about 80-90% ice left in my large plastic cup, after finishing most of my House Coffee by the time I made my way to Costco Gas in Summerlin (note: Avoid going to Costco right after their store holiday, the line just trying to get into the parking lot was nuts) then that is way too much ice, for a place NOT specializing in selling ice with a side add-on of tea or coffee.

So, I was tagged by Stefany V on Instagram about this new boba tea place called 7 Leaves Cafe having their Grand Opening promo on Saturday, January 5th at noon. The next day a coworker sent me a message on Instagram of a screen cap of an article about 7 Leaves Cafe opening a location in Las Vegas, and asked if I ""tired this place""? Lol.

The social media hype machine is going full steam ahead of the official grand opening, and whoever is behind this effort deserves their paycheck.

Anyway, I was semi-surprised when I saw Stefany V posting photos of her drink orders yesterday and an uploaded review.  So I figure I make a detour and check them out after work.

In spite of being in the same plaza as Pho Kim Long, the parking situation wasn't horrible, at just after noon on Wednesday, January 2, 2019. I parked further away and walked the rest of the way as a precaution, for apparently no reason.  So best time to drop by with better luck gaining the favor of the parking demi-god is early weekday.

When I arrived, there was already a small line (3 different parties ahead of me, and 2 out of town visitors arrived shortly after I paid for my order). The interior is decent. Very clean.  Okay amount of seats and tables, but most likely not sufficient if business really picks up.

Their menu is very simple (a plus in my book, if all of the menu offerings are executed at a high level). Just 3 coffee options, and 13 Tea/juice, and 2 cup sizes (regular or large), as well as a 1/2 gallon option.  If this is your first time visiting or can't decide on what to order, I overheard after I already placed and paid for my drinks, that they offer samples for their entire drink menu (except the Matcha Soy).  I was on the fence about ordering their Taro Milk Tea, that insightful tip would have been very useful a minute earlier.

Anyway, I never customize my order the first time visiting any restaurants for the first time.  So no ""less ice"" or ""1/2 sweet"", etc. on my order of their House Coffee and Assam Milk Tea (never heard of it before and decided to give it a try).  I really wish I broke that rule.

Their House Coffee is something I will not order again.  I've never had authentic Vietnamese-style Creamy Iced Coffee when I visited Vietnam years ago, and I don't recall ever having one when I lived in Cali. If I am in the mood for Vietnamese coffee, which is often, I will just order that instead.

The Assam Milk Tea is pretty good.  Probably on the sweeter side for most, but I overwhelmingly prefer sweeter tea drinks then more calorie-friendly versions.

Service was quick and cashier was pleasant. While in line, I can easily see into their kitchen, and there are at least 5-6 workers back there. But everything was pre-made and simply poured into the plastic cups as the orders are inputted and prints out for fulfillment.

Maybe it is the soft opening menu, combined with the lack of availability of hot beverages during this especially cold day, and excessive amount of ice on their default preparation, but I am definitely underwhelmed after my first visit ever to a 7 Leaves Cafe.

If you plan to frequent this location, be sure to get their ""Stamp Card""."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"This review is about 3 months in the making.

I live very close to this location, but for the longest time have driven past the strip mall it is in and never see it.  In fact, after researching online for a Hawaiian BBQ place in the SW part of Las Vegas, and getting all excited that there might be a decent restaurant within 5 minutes drive I hopped in the car to go check this place out.  But my first attempt was a dismal failure, since I wasn't able to find the restaurant even after standing in the middle of the strip mall, and thought maybe they too were a casualty of the economy. I looked everywhere in the main part of the strip mall, but not the small building that is closer to the street and between the gas station and Taco Bell.  There were no signage in the side of the building, so when I was looking at that building and seeing the drive-thru pickup window, I thought it was part of Quizzno's.

Anyway, a few nights later after getting craving for Hawaiian mixed plate kind of food, I decided to call the restaurant's number of Yelp to verify if the business is still opened.  A friendly female voice answered the phone and confirmed that they are indeed still in operation and confirmed that they are still opened.  So I excitedly hopped in the car again and went to the restaurant.  (Yes, I get easily excited over Hawaiian food)

The restaurant must have been some sort of fast food place in its former life, And since being taken over by Island Style BBQ, not much in terms of redecorating has been invested in that department.  But I wasn't here to dine-in and soak up the ambiance, so I didn't really care.

There were no one else at the restaurant at the time (weeknight after 8pm) placing my to-go order was quick, and I sat at one of the small tables watching a DVD that was playing on their TV.

For this first successful visit I decided to try their BBQ mix-plate, which I think is a easy way to compare their food to all the other restaurant in this category.  The portion is comparable to the others.  Price is a bit higher than I am used to in California, but par for the course in Las Vegas.  Flavor of the Mac Salad was not great, but it wasn't terrible, just ehh so-so (ma-ma-hu-hu = Chinese expression for I can't decide if I want to like it or dislike it).  The BBQ Chicken was good.  The short ribs were way overcooked, and I think they just gave me whatever is left near the end of the day's service.  The BBQ beef was likewise less than stellar, but had average flavor.  Overall, up to this point I don't have high opinions of this place, but i am willing to give it another shoot.

So a few weeks later, I came back and this time studied their menu more carefully and order their Kalua Pork and BBQ Chicken.  Yes, they were both all for me!  
The Kalua Pork was again, average to not all that.  Portion of rice is par, but the Kalua Pork was skimmy.  My old housemate made better Kalua Pork, and she is not even Hawaiian and have only visited the islands on vacations.  And of course I made way better ones at school based on the recipe given to me by a Chef that originally was from Hawaii. The BBQ Chicken was good and I have nothing negative to say about that.

On my latest visit, I decided to check out the short ribs again.  It wasn't as overcooked as the first time I tried it.  But whoever was in charge of preparing it can really get additional lessons.

So, I really want to like this place a lot because it is so close to home, but there are just so many little things that adds up to tiny voices in my heard that urges me to ""drive to Sahara for the real Island Style"".  And here is the bullet point break down for the review scores.

Great:
1) Very very close to home.  Convenient location for me in the SW part of Las Vegas.
2) Ample parking.

Good:
1) BBQ Chicken - good flavor and cooked right (not under or overcooked).
2) Decent size portions.
3) Friendly staff, at least on my visits.

Room for improvement:
1) BBQ Short Ribs - the cook is killing a perfectly good ingredient, and I will not want to be invited to one of his backyard BBQ party.
2) Mediocre Kalua Pork and rather stingy on the portion.
3) BBQ Beef - Should be easy to make, but have fallen flat as an item that should be the foundation that the menu is built upon.
4) Signage at the side of the building.

So 2.5 stars from me, and one of the star is for being so close to home."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Plenty of natural lighting, vibrant color scheme (white and orange), and tasteful decor instantly scores an A on my restaurant decorating score card.  And the cheerful greetings and friendly smiles vaporizes any lingering traces of everyday life stress that you might have brought with you as you crossed over the threshold. As far as I was concerned, I was in near Zen state to enjoy whatever deliciously food the kitchen has to offer from their Restaurant Week lunch menu.


As I was seated at my table, I was offered a choice of DW's own beverage creation. I opted for the Pomegranate Iced Tea, which was served in a tall slender glass with a wedge of lemon.  It was refreshing and not at all tart, a great start to any meal or a pick me up after a spa treatment. And below is my review of the three courses served as part of the RW DW Bistro's Lunch Prix-Fixe menu. 


First Course: It was a tough choice, but I went with the DW Spanish Chorizo with Shrimp & Summer Tomatoes (instead of the Farmers Market Fresh Berry Salad with Grilled Pineapple & Jerk Pomegranate Dressing - which garnered a lot of attention from the ladies at the next table while they were still debating what to order).  With the elegant and not over the top presentation, fantastic flavors from the Spanish Chorizo and nicely cooked shrimp and tantalizing tomatoes, this was easily my favorite item of the meal.  And lucky for me, it is available on their regular menu!


Second Course: 

Trio of Sliders. Maybe it was the whole food truck phenomenon in the past year, but my mind was made up when I read sliders.  Although I did forced myself to read the remaining options, out of standardized test taking habits. The plate of sliders on mini brioche buns and sweet potato fries looks great.  The sliders individually are small (smaller than Slidin' Thru's sliders) but all three of them combined into up a fair amount of food.


The first slider I tried was the Jamaican Jerk Pork, which left a noticeable puddle of grease on the plate and underside of the bun. My first and only Fuku Truck burger experience, complete with the horribly grease-soaked buns that I suffered through did an instant replay in my head before I managed to locate the mental stop play button.  Luckily, it was a lot less grease, but still a sharp drop from the excitement from the first course. 


Slider #2 was the mini-me-sized DW Turkey Burger.  The turkey was juicy, and the mango pear apple chutney combined to make miniaturized fireworks in my mouth.  If the regular sized burger has the same juicy turkey, then I will happily order that again on my next trip back.  Favorite #2!


The last slider I ate was the New Mexican Red Chili Pork Slider.  It has a kick to it, but I felt that it was missing something. Maybe crispy fried onions for a little crunchy texture or over-easy quail eggs for the addition of the rich and creaminess of the egg.


Third Course:

DW Trio of Desserts featuring Red Velet Cake (was good), Lemon-Lime Pudding with a fresh Blueberry (a spoonful is not enough,I want more!) and Jamaican Black Bottom Banana Cream Pie (Not sure if this was what I was served? But the chocolate dominated the other flavors, which wasn't bad as I have a weak spot for chocolates).  


Overall, the lunch was good.  Definitely top notched wait staff that flawlessly attend to the guests while they dine.  The appetizers seems to be the star here,at least for me, and I would come back just for that section of the menu alone. 


Ambiance:  5/5  From the other reviews I am not alone in thinking that they hit a home run with their interior decorating concept and execution.  Care to give me your interior designer and contractor as a referral?


Service:  5/5  Just simply pleasant without being over the top.


Price:  4.5/5  Looking at the pricing and the portions of the regular menu items, it is a nice lunch spot to go to recharge for the rest of your day.  Items are mostly in the $10-$13 range, which is more than the average lunch specials, but is a great deal considering the upscale surroundings and pleasant service.


Food:  4/5  Some items are perfect, others needs some more tweaking are needed. Overall, still great food.


Location:  SW Las Vegas.  Pretty far for out-of-town visitors staying on the Strip.  Definitely a cool spot for locals that work or living in the area.

Solid 4.5 stars!  I am an excited fan hungry for more.  Burp!"
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"I don't live or work in this part of town, so when I do travel this way it is usually to go to one of the restaurants in the nearby Commercial Center or simply passing through.  So over the years I have driven past this unassuming restaurant that practically blends in with the other random businesses on this stretch of E Sahara, and never really given it a second thought.  So I am glad that we the typical question about where to get dinner ultimately lead us to E-Jo Korean Restaurant.

Their menu is pleasantly simple. Just 2 pages worth, and almost all of it is dedicated to the various traditional Korean soups not found at other Korean restaurants. These soups are the final product of hours of slow simmering to extract the flavors from the beef bones used in its preparation.  You can order the soup according to the meats and other ingredients that you want served in it.  If you are a beginner, then go with item #1 (Brisket Beef Soup for $9.99). If you are adventurous, then order item #8 (Their Combination Beef Soup with all the ingredients listed in items 1-7).

The soups themselves are what many would considered bland, but that is completely intentional. And sea salt is available on the table for diners to adjust their soup to their individual taste (very good for individuals with high blood pressure or are on a low sodium diet, since it is easy to add salt but impossible to get it out).  Besides that, there are Korean spicy chili paste and another soybean paste and garlic mixture for flavoring the soup or as a dip for the cucumber chili (most were not spicy, but there were a few that did packed some heat, so be careful if you don't like it too spicy).

In the end I opted for item #3 (Beef Knee Bone Soup with Tendon, $13.99).  If you like soft tendons, there are a lot of it in here, but no other pieces of beef.  Overall, this alone was just okay for me even with all of the tinkering that went into fine tuning my soup.

The surprised highlight of the meal for me and probably everyone I ate with (Michael K and Roger T) is the restaurant's house made kimchi (2 varieties: radish and cabbage).  As far as banchans are concerned relative to other Korean restaurants, the selection is minimal.  However, what the E-Jo lack in kimchi selections is more than make up by the quality and flavors that they packed.  I will be happy with a few servings of rice and their kimchi, and maybe just a small bowl of soup or side order of Stir Fried Ribeye or Spicy Pork.  The kimchis are that mind blowningly good!  Forget the other K-Restaurant's commercially sourced industrial kimchis.  I want E-Jo's artisanal kimchi goodness!

Service was friendly and efficient. The food came out with nominal wait time.  You can help yourself to as much kimchi as you want.  However, be polite and considerate and get the kimchi out of the jar with the provided tongs and put it on the serving plate first (no ones wants your cootie crossed contaminated double dipped leftover kimchi, not even your GF or BF).

In the mood to drink responsibly?  They offer, you guessed it, Soju!  Plus Korean beers and rice wines and soda for me.

For entertainment, besides staring at your iPhone or Android devices and neglecting your dining companions (okay if you are Yelping, but only because I am Yelping too), catch up on Korean programming of the variety show category on their TV (at least that was what was on at the time of my visit).  

Afraid of ordering wrong because you are not Korean, can't speak Korean, but you still want to madly impressed your Korean GF or just being  culinaryly (I am making up words because of their kimchi) adventurous minus the requisite language skill, have no fear! pictures of menu items are on the wall for easy visual reference.  Or just ask the restaurant staff taking your order, silly.

(Getting the frantic hand signals to wrap it up)

E-Jo, a good Korean soup restaurant to visit, especially as the thermometer starts dipping towards your feet.  Lastly, awesome kimchi!

4 stars! **** out of *****

Trivial observation: Their soups all look the same to me here.  But I can assure you I am not a soup racist. I have had soups from many culinary traditions in the past. Just the other day I thoroughly enjoyed a miso soup, and before that an Italian Wedding Soup, and a very invigorating cold Borscht from Russia (or was it or Ukrainian origin) just over the summer. My point is I am not a soup racist."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"A new, nice, bright, clean frosty dessert spot just in time for the infamous Las Vegas heat season.  As far as timing the grand opening of Kuma (meaning ""bear"" in Japanese) Snow Cream, Chef Jet Tila has definitely picked a good month to open his latest F&B venture to the public.  After all when it is hot enough to transform your wind shield wipers into rubber spaghetti (just wait a few weeks), everyone will seek reprieve from the unrelenting sun in any way possible. Having a tasty snow ice will be one of the latest method for beating the heat.

But let's back up a bit.  Most people are familiar with frozen desserts such as shaved ice, snow cones and frozen yogurts. Snow Ice is NOT exactly like any of those familiar frozen treats.  It is a Taiwanese shaved ice dessert variation (Japanese shaved ice is called Kakigoori, it is similar but prepared differently and also not exactly like true Snow Ice) that has became very popular to the locals and visiting tourists, and can best be described as eating frozen cotton candy (because when snow ice is prepared and served correctly, it should literally melt in your mouth), its appearance is also very unique.  There are a lot of different flavors and recipes for making Snow Ice, but most are made using fruit, juice or fruit juice concentrates and milk, and freezing the liquid mixture into a block of creamy ice for Snow-Shaving.  (CONGRATULATIONS! You are now an intermediate level expert on Snow ICE!)

A ""so easy a caveman can do it"" test to determine if you are having an authentically made/executed snow ice is to perform a quick 1) visual and 2) taste tests.  Snow Ice is velvety smooth, so you should not see any ice crystals in your dessert.  Once you get a spoonful of Snow Ice in your mouth, it should just melt in your mouth and you should definitely NOT feel the texture or grainy ice crystals on your tongue.  If you see or feel ice crystals, than it is made incorrectly or poorly.

Now that you know what a real Snow Ice is supposed to be, you can be the judge of Kuma Snow Cream's attempt at preparing this frozen treat.

As for me, aside from how successful of the attempt at making Snow Ice, it still comes down to flavor and value.  I tried taro snow cream from Kuma Snow Cream (KSC) and selected the fresh blueberry, lychee and mango as my three included topping, which is then topped off with Strawberry Sauce. It was very refreshing in the mildly warm weather.  The staff placed a good amount of toppings on my frozen treat, that I felt it was a good value for the $7 Sumo (32 oz sized cup) dessert I ordered.  The wait was nominal, and the entire ordering process was pleasant.  There is also a stamp card, where frequent customers can get a free 10th snow cream after accumulating 9 stamps.

My friend ordered his Taro snow cream topped with red bean, mango and something else, and commented that the read bean alone would be perfect with taro.  So next time I will have to try that flavor combination.

Summary about the menu and ordering process:

1. Pick one of two sizes. Sumo (large 32 oz cup costs $7) or Ninja (small, 20 oz cup costs $5.50), which comes with three toppings and a sauce.

2. 5 snow cream to select from (Mango, Taro, Kuma Snow, Green Tea, or Strawberry).  Not sure if they will allow you to select more than one flavor.

3.  24 toppings to select from (from fresh and canned fruits, nuts, to popular cereal and candies), each will costs $0.50 extra past the initial three toppings.

4.  Top it with a sauce (5 options include Condensed Milk, Chocolate, Caramel, Mango and Strawberry), $0.25 for each additional sauce.  The sauces are NOT homemade variety, but those you order in jars or cans.    

5.  Pay up buddy! Then wait a spell for your pre-concocted or personally customized snow cream combo to be prepared.

6.  Tipping is optional, but appreciated.

7.  Enjoy!  Conduct optional ""Is this real Snow Ice"" test.  Tell your friends, write a review on Yelp. Collect stamps.  Be nice to people.

Kuma Snow Cream is located on Spring Mountain and Valley View (same plaza as Starbucks, and across the street from Kung Fu Thai).  The parking lot is small, so drive carefully, and consider carpooling.

Final thoughts:  Not the authentic snow ice I had at the place that started the craze in Taipei, but this is the best imitation in town at the moment.  Be the first amongst your friends to try it, you know you strive to be cool like that."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"October 7 is a special anniversary for Ribs and Burgers. I wasn't sure if it was the birthday of this particular location or that of their original restaurant. Whatever the case may be, the tall and very pleasant-looking lady who took my order, excitedly told me that I would received $5 off my order of their Original Burger. Sounds good to me!!!

I also added a side of bacon to that order. Probably the best thing you can do to their burgers. If you are not opposed to having bacon in your diet, then forking over another $1.40 for their bomb bacon is a must!  It is smoky, crispy and good that must be why it is the number one banned substance by some major world religion.  Based on just having their bacon, I think their ribs is likely to be above average too. 

So before I get ahead of my self this is what I ordered on my inaugural visit to Ribs and Burgers.

Original Burger - Grain-feed Beef Patty, Grilled, Basted, and served on Sesame Seeded Bun with Iceberg Lettuce, Tomato, Spanish Onion*, Dill Pickles, and their Pink & BBQ Sauce.  Added the Bacon.  I added the BACON!

Aussie Burger - Grain-feed Beef Patty, Beetroot, Pineapple, Swiss Cheese, Bacon, Fried Egg, Iceburg Lettuce, Tomato, Spanish Onion*, Dill Pickles, and their Pink & BBQ Sauce.

Non-alcoholic version of the S'Mores Me Up Milkshake (Ice Cream, Marshmallow and Hersay's Chocolate).

Ordering process was friendly and smooth.  There was a small crowd ahead of me, so the modest wait time was completely acceptable. But that area is not large, so line will easily go out the door if there is more than about 10 people placing their order or waiting to do so.

There is a huge menu for you to inspect just inside the door, which is pretty straight forward.

About the food. My S'Mores Me Up Shake took a few minutes to be served. But it looks and tasted just like a plain chocolate milk shake. No marshmallow or pieces of real Hersey's Milk Chocolate pieces to garnish came with the order. I am assuming that their recipe has changed since they opened, because Yelp photos of the same drink looks different than mine. Maybe the non-alcoholic version does not get the same finishing touches as the age-restricted version.  Subtle age discrimination at work here. Junior Civil Rights Groups, Teen Titans, and Young Justice League would all be outrage at the fact that minors and those that opted to not booze it up are not receiving equal treatment under FDA restaurant labeling requirements.  All this potential legal drama over an innocent milkshake!!!

Aussie Burger - Very substantial burger!  Most people can't even open their mouth wide enough to fit this burger. I suspect that magical Slytherin or muggles with the ability to unhinged their jaw or expert practitioners of foot in mouth talent (e.g., Donald Trump?) would be capable of accomplishing this feat. 

Totally got sidetracked. So... Best part about this burger is that it comes with BACON. Plain old raw Red Onion served in all burgers instead of the sweet Spanish Onions (* Spanish Onions have lower sulfur content, naturally sweeter but with shorter shelf life) in the description.  The Fried Egg would be better if is closer to the ""over easy"", so the runny  yolk can add that extra richness to the burger experience. The pineapple and beetroot can both be eliminated, it didn't add anything except bulk and carbs.  Overall just an average premium burger.

The Original Burger is decent, closer to the ideal for purist, I personally think that it is better than the Aussie once the BACON is added.

Medium was requested for doneness, but both burgers served closer to well done (just a tiny bit of red left on a canvas of brown. Still juicy, but that is probably because they baste it during the grilling process.

A nice amenity provided by the restauranteur is a hand sink in the middle of the dining area. No need to find a restroom or organize all your girlfriends for an expedition, just to not have sticky hands on the drive to the next destination.

Summary: Outdoor seating area is nice when the temperature is not excessively hot or cold. Burgers are just alright. I really wish it was better given the effort to develop their signature burgers. I overpaid for chocolate shake which I can get cheaper and better at Burger King (BK Vanilla Milkshake tops my list for fast food milkshakes).  Their $10 lunch combo is a good value if you are already at Downtown Summerlin.

3 stars (rounding up)."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"More than adequate staffing level at present, all chefs/cooks visible in the kitchen speak Japanese, the menu is possibly unique here in Las Vegas (aside from the sister restaurant Kabuki).  The minimalistic ambiance of this small restaurant just works for me. And if you want to photo-document your meal, sit at the ""pasta bar"" counter, the lighting there is adequate for simple food photography needs.

So Down to business.  A group of Yelpers were actually at the plaza where this new restaurant is located at last night (Monday), which is currently their only day off.  So I decided I was going to check them out the next evening after work.  As the chef, possibly the owner, handed us their business cards and a few menu (he was at the restaurant with a few others).

When I arrived at 7:30pm on Tuesday, the place had 4 tables occupied already, and I am pretty sure that everyone there, except yours truly, was a native Japanese.  I considered that a positive indicator for seeking authentic Japanese style rendition of Western cuisine.

The menu is pretty simple, pastas are on the specials board, while appetizers,salads, chef's special dishes are on a 2-sided menu. The dessert menu also offers some Western desserts with a Japanese twist. Menu prices are mostly in the $teens, but can quickly add up to a meal costing $30-40+ per person.

On my inaugural visit, I tried the Miso Carbonara for main course #1 and Kurobuta Tonkatsu ""Nakamura-Ya"" Style for main course #2.  

The  Miso Carbonara pasta dish was good, the flavor is obviously different from traditional Italian Carbonara pasta dishes, but the sauce was creamy with a mild flavor.  I personally would prefer the pieces of bacon to be cooked a bit more, but that is a personal preference of mine.  Check out the picture I posted if you are interested in trying out this item. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA?select=eSNQvL3QRJTT66ztOZ2-QQ
Flavor: 3.5 stars. Presentation: 3.5 stars. Value: 3 stars.

Since I was still hungry, I went and ordered the Kurobuta Tonkatsu ""Nakamura-Ya"" Style from the Chef's Special Dishes portion of the menu.  It is a very delicious and juicy tonkatsu (fried pork cutlet) that is served with a tomato sauce, an asparagus, watercress, a button mushroom cut upand awedgeoflemon as garnish.  The only thing I thought was missing was a starch component to the entree, like rice pilaf or something.  Then again, maybe the roll that is served with the meal is meant to serve that role.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA?select=C-6NKQW_7vs5xV_GZMd9lA
Flavor: 5 stars. Presentation: 3 stars.  Value: 3 stars.

For dessert I had the Soy Milk Panna Cotta ""Okinawa Black Sugar"" Sauce for $5.95, but the Black Sesame Blanc Manger also looks very interesting on the menu.  The Panna Cotta was pretty good, I like the flavor, although the texture seems a bit firmed (like too much gelatin was used) to me. However, the Okinawa Black Sugar Sauce was the key component that makes this dessert.  The dessert is probably prepared by savory chefs, as some basic pastry chef attention to detail was amissed (utilized sprig of mint that had clear signs of pest feeding on the leaf as a very noticeable garnish just seems careless, and something that can easily be prevented). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6H8xfhoZ2IGa3eNiY5FqLA?select=o1ILKDTRwUZ9t6x3W5KJfg

Anyway, I like this new addition to the Las Vegas restaurant scene, and can see myself paying the occasional visit when I am in the mood.

Location: In the same plaza as Raku, Monta Ramen, Big Won, Soul Oak Korean BBQ.  Very accessible if you are near the Chinatown area.

Parking:  3/5  Could easily gets crowded, but not filled to capacity where you have to look for nearby street parking.

Ambiance:  4.5/5  I like the execution of the interior decor and the lighting (dim in the main dining area, and well lite at the ""pasta bar""counter.

Service:  4.5/5  Pleasant service by a small squad of friendly waitresses.

Value:  3.5/5  Not a cheap meal, but I do think you get what you pay for, plus there is not much competition for this kind of cuisine in Las Vegas at the moment.

Flavor:  4 stars overall, some dishes and items are executed better than others.  But the balance of flavor that is not too overpowering, and compliments the components of the dish is what will make you go back for more.

4 stars!  Bravo and welcome to Las Vegas Trattoria Nakamura-Ya!!!

Note:  They do accept AMEX."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Quick summary - decent NY style deli fare for casual diners looking for a relatively inexpensive any time of the day meal within the top notch Wynn/Encore casino resort.  Don't expect much in terms of service, it is a walk up to the counter and place your order with a helpful cashier and take your ""number"" to the seat of your choice and wait for the runner to bring it to you casual dining operation.  Food is okay to good. Dessert looks decent, but did not have a chance to try it.  Meal Price = $15-25 avg per person.
My cousin, uncle and one of their office staff were visiting from Taiwan and attending the SuperZoo Tradeshow at Mandalay Bay. After picking them up from MB, we headed for the Wynn and ended up at Zoozacrackers, which is near the Wynn Sports Book.  After looking over a sign near the entrance with a partial listing of the menu, we waited in line to place our order with the cashier.  The bill for 4 came to $89 plus change and we ordered 3 soups, 2 iced teas (really a super profit center for Wynn),  1 Turkey Reuben, 1 Hot Pastrami, 1 Mo Wrap, 1 Tuna Salad Sandwich, and a Rebel Fries.
After finding a table and sitting down, it felt like a long time for our order to be prepared and brought out to us.  It could be that there was another group of 5-6 that ordered right before us.  Anyway, it is probably the fact that it was already 3:50pm and they had originally planned to be at the airport at 4pm. So when the food arrived, my cousin finished her soup before I was done taking pictures of all the food we had ordered.  And normally she is not exactly a fast eater, but walking around a tradeshow for 8-9 hours can make anyone famish. But we still have time to properly finish the meal before having to rush off to the airport.  I asked for to-go containers and the cashier was nice enough to go search in the back for several large ones for us.  So I basically have 1/2 of each sandwich we ordered for my tasting and Yelp review.

My Hot Pastrami was decent.  Good portion of thinly sliced pastrami, but not as good as Katz's (even though they supposedly checked out Kat's in NY when they were planning the menu) on choice of bread (Rye, White, Sour Dough, etc.). But good enough to come back for more for me.

My Uncle's Turkey Reuben - not my favorite. Overall the sandwich just feels dry, and the turkey is the main culprit. And holding it in your hand makes it greasy.

Mo Wrap - looks good in the display case, and tastes good too. The coleslaw is what gives this turkey wrap the tangy moistness that have doomed the other turkey sandwich in the deli menu lineup.
 
Tuna Salad Sandwich - this was ordered by accident, since my cousin had intended for it to be a ""salad"" salad for us to share, but there are only 3 salad options on the menu (Chef's Salad, Cobb and Caesar). The tuna salad mix was okay, reminds me of the Tuna Panini Sandwich served at Jean Philippe's Patisserie at Bellagio/Aria, except with less chopped celery and black pepper, and red onions instead of white). But it really is too moist for the bread and the bottom piece of bread quickly became too soggy. I would not order it in the future for the messy factor, plus why come to Vegas for a sandwich you can easily make at home?

Rebel Fries - just your fries topped with gooey cheese, jalapeño, and other not too memorable garnishes. Portion is large, definitely a meal for one or a side for sharing. But taste is blah at best.

Soups - Big portions  and I would considered a good deal for a dining establishment within the Wynn or other major Strip casinos.  Highly recommended if you want something satisfying and have positive perceived value for the money.

Iced Tea at $3.50 + tax - Highway robbery pricing for the less than 8 oz of liquid you get in a small plastic cup, mostly filled with ice cubes.  Steve Wynn admitted/bragged about his casino's super high profit margin from beverage sales (like1,000%) and this is a fine example of how he is delivering shareholder value.

Anyway, I would not really recommend this place for locals, but if you are a visitor to Las Vegas and staying at the Wynn/Encore or even across the street at Palazzo, it is a decent price meal option without having to cab it to some other restaurant. Of course you can pay more for the buffet and get a fabulous meal with a lot of variety.

3 stars for visitors without a car (2 stars for Las Vegas locals, because we can drive to better places that are cheaper and frankly offers better food). If you want to eat at the Wynn, seriously consider the Wynn Buffet or other sit down restaurant which will cost more but you also get better food."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Gabi, sounds like Taiwanese for coffee, at least the way I pronounce it. So if Gabi Cafe opened a location in Taiwan, it would literally means ""Coffee"" Cafe and continues the decades old trend of combining multiple dialects and languages in conversations or naming things by Taiwanese hipsters.

I can't speak Korean, but I now seriously wonder if Gabi means coffee in Korean as well.  

Anyway, I've noticed the Gabi sign up for awhile while having dinner at Hobak and whenever I drove past it on Spring Mountain Road for the past few months. So when my foodie friends commented about their impending soft opening, I made a mental note to check it out after work.

Gabi Coffee and Bakery is located in the same booming plaza as Hobak and Ramen Hashi, during the day it is not too hard to find parking out front, but dinner time and weekends... different beast all together. Luckily there are more parking spaces around the sides and back. My friend told me Gabi Cafe is actually owned by the same entity as the owner of Hobak KBBQ.

On your first visit, don't get deter by the vintage looking wooden door, with metalworks that looks like the doors are bar shut. I didn't notice it the first time (door was already opened), but on my second visit the couple walking right in front of me was momentarily perplex by it and most likely were wondering if Gabi Cafe was opened or not.

Upon walking inside and seeing the interior, I already like the place. The displays of the pastries, croissants and cakes are located just inside the door, as well as the cashier that you would place your order with.  Just behind that is a ""glass greenhouse"" that houses their kitchen. It is really cool!

The chairs, sofas, tables, chandeliers are a mishmash collection that resembles the extensive efforts of raiding multiple estate sales and second hand stores. But the end result is a wonderfully eclectic collection that brightens and lifts spirits, and perfect backdrop of impressing your social media followers.  The pineapple motif and fuzzy chandeliers are my favorites. Even the ceiling fans are worth checking out, as the interior designer opted to use a rustic multi blade rotor windmill design popular on rural farmhouses.

I was not as impressed by the drinks or desserts I ordered, though.  Desserts are at the level of 85C (Taiwanese bakery chain that have since successfully gone international), with much better exterior presentation. 

The Gabi (Dry Cappuccino with sprinkles of ground coffee and organic raw sugar) was okay, but I could definitely do without the ground coffee. (3/5)

The Caramella (Ristretto on Sweetened Condensed Milk), the manager or owner  excited told me the beverage was inspired by a Spanish drink and the ratio is one to one for the short shot of espresso coffee to the sweetened condensed milk. The drink looks beautiful, has nice layers for the camera and the presentation down to the selection of cherry blossom motif teaspoon is practically every Instagramer's wet dream. But it was super super sweet (and I favored sweet beverages), so maybe during soft opening the ratio was not dialed down to perfection yet. (1/5)

Lychee Rose Cake - Looks beautiful for pictures, but taste wise it was alright. Personally this dessert is not too sweet for my taste, which is a good thing in my book. But another friend that tried it said it was too sweet for her. Can't please everyone. (2/5)

DanMee, like a very soft cheesecake, with floral-flavored mousse topped with a delicate gelee that tastes oddly familiar, yet I was unable to identify. Decent. (3/5)

Coffee Tiramisu, non-traditional presentation concept, but the ladyfingers was rather dry, so recipe or execution needs improvement. (2.5/5)

Tofu Cheesecake, haven't tried too many, but their version is almost bland. Sweet tooth foodies would probably be underwhelmed. (2.5/5)

Rainbow Roulade, brightens any photos with its vibrant colors. My camera had a bite or two, but I opted out from trying it.

Charcoal Bun. It is black, inside and out, but as a bread it was rather good. (3.5/5)

Service is very good. Staff was friendly and eager to please. 

Unofficial consensus of my friends that have visited thus far: Interior is amazing! Savory menu items better than the sweets. Teas better than coffee. Go early, as items will run out if you end up there too late (at least during the soft opening period).

Definitely predicting Gabi Cafe to be a hit hangout spot in the near future, and you will probably randomly bump into friends and acquaintances with high probability.

Next time I go, I will check out their savory menu for myself. 

Gabi Coffee & Bakery (Gabi Cafe) would be an easy 5+ out of 5 if judged just by the decor and ambiance. But on beverages & edibles (not what you think), it is 3/5 A-OK!!!"
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Without Godzilla's review, I would totally not even known about this new restaurant called Koraku Ramen.  As I am not Japanese, not a subscriber to their phone tree or otherwise connected to the local Japanese social network scene.  So Hoodie, aka Godzilla X, thanks for bringing this new Japanese eatery to the attention of Yelp users.

Koraku Ramen, is a small chain restaurant from California (Little Tokyo and Sherman Oaks) that finally relocated their other Nevada location to Las Vegas.  So for those of you who have visited their other locations, you guys will probably be very familiar with their menu.  As for me, this is most likely the very first time I have ever been to one of their restaurants.  The LV branch is located in the same plaza as Krung Siam, Pho Little Saigon, Quiznos and Starbucks Coffee, on the SE corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View.  Currently there is no signage indicating the name (or it was not put out on my first visit on Tuesday around 6pm) and unless you happened to read a little Japanese and can kinda sorta maybe translate the little ""We're Open"" sign near their front door, it will be hard to guess what kind of food they might serve.

The restaurant interior is pretty simply decorated, with a giant poster of an classic Japanese movie hanging above what looks like the exterior seating area of a ramen-ya in Japan.  There are additional smaller, classic Japanese movie posters on the wall, but you will have to tilt your head back to see them. Which is cool, because I enjoy watching old Japanese movies, and it kind of reminded me of the decor of the ramen museum (Yokohama, Japan) I visited with a a group of friends a few years back.  

Seats in the booth are surprisingly comfortable, thanks to the cushy cushions for our tushies.  It is the next best thing for our arse, than a pricier Derriere Facial.  Such thoughtfulness is very much appreciated.

The menu features entrees served with rice (such as various curries, katsu, sweet & sour pork meatballs), fried rice and noodles, and 1/3 of the menu dedicated to their diverse line up of ramen.  

Here are my impressions of the food I tried on my two visits (dinner and lunch):

Shoyu Ramen:  Broth was mild but flavorful, not overly salty compared to most local ramen restaurants.  Chasu is nice, but could be even more tender and flavorful. Suggested add-ons:  Wakame, 3 slices of Chasu, and Ajitsuke Tamago (Japanese flavored soft boiled egg).  (3.5/5)

Pork Fried Rice:  Simply prepared. Tasty.  (3.5/5)

Gyoza:  Nothing extraordinary, but prepared well.  Has nice crispy base, and is a good appetizer.  Server recommended that we eat it with the spicy oil (Ra-Yu). (3.5/5)

Beef Curry on Rice:  Decent.  (3/5)

Spicy House Special Ramen (mild):  Pretty good portion. A lot of ingredients, even without any add-ons.  Leosdianto L. commented that it kind of reminded him of ramen we make at home, and I agree.  (3.5/5)

Nikudango (Sweet & Sour Pork Meatballs):  The sauce seems to be on the salty side, but I didn't try this with rice.  Reminded me of meatballs on a skewer, without the pineapple and the stick.  (3/5)

Service (early dinner): We were the only there, so service was excellent.  The evening crew seems to be staff by mostly Japanese mothers.  They were very friendly, attentive, and food came out of the kitchen fairly quickly. (4.5/5)

Service during the lunch rush (customers were overwhelmingly Japanese ex-pats, including local business owners and social gathering of house wives. When I closed my eyesand listen to their conversation, which I can't understand at all, it almost felt like I am in Japan without the cost of flight and hours on the plane) was friendly and attentive, but took the kitchen noticeably longer to serve up two bowls of ramen. (2.5/5)

Obviously the restaurant is very new, so it is super clean, and I expect that it will be maintained that way.

Parking. Not all that much (maybe 85) parking spaces in this tiny strip mall when it gets really busy. And there are no street parking in the immediate surrounding, being on the corner of two high traffic streets.  Big city dwellers will be used to that, for the rest be patient or walk a block or two.  (3/5)

Final thoughts. Koraku, once it has been opened for awhile and worked out most of the new restaurant kinks, it will be a respectable competition to other local Japanese restaurants that primarily serve ramen and curry.  Ramen combo deals (ramen + 1/2 order of fried rice or curry rice) is a good value for the Hungry-Man (R) and Hungry-Woman (patent registration pending).

P.S. It was great running into Mike C. and James I on my first visit.  Thanks for inviting me to join your party.  You guys are cool!

P.P.S.  Now accepting cash, credit and debit, gold and silver coins, and I.O.U.s from your pals.

3.5 stars."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"I went to Big Wong Restaurant for a Meetup (Sushi & More) gathering, met some diverse and interesting folks and we for the most part enjoyed the meal we had during their opening $1 promotion.

My first visit was on the evening of the opening day.  The place was packed already by about 7pm, and I was glad I grabbed a 6-top for our 7:30pm get together.  Service was hectic, but that is to be expected with the place being so slammed from everyone and their coworker's grandmother stopping by to check out the new Chinese restaurant near the corner of Decatur and Spring Mountain, which serves basically Malaysian, Taiwanese, Cantonese and a little Asian fusion food.

The thing I immediately like about Big Wong is that it has a very basic menu of 17 entrees, which can be consolidated to just 7 main items (i.e., steamed chicken, fried chicken, fried pork chop, curry chicken, wontons, thin ribeye, shrimp). Personally I think the biggest common  mistake restaurateurs make is having way too much items on the menu, where their kitchen is not able to perfect them all.  Better to have a smaller menu and make them all perfectly, I say.

Anyway, I ordered the Hoi Nam Chicken (boneless dark meat) Over Rice - dish with origin in Chinese's Hainanese regional cuisine, which is also very popular in Malaysia and Singaporean due to Chinese immigrants to those countries. The chicken is fine, but I prefer my rice to be more ""seasoned"".

I have also tried the Fried Chicken Over Rice (boneless) - I really like this one, as the chicken is fried well and is still juicy.  I know I will order this in the future.

The Fired Pork Chop was disappointing for me.  I was expecting it to be more tender and juicy, but it was on the tough side. The minced pork sauce that it was served with help me finish the entree, but I will most likely not try this again.

The Curry with Roti looks good when my dining companions ordered it.  I will try that next time, besides what is not to like about Roti!  The curry itself can be a little less on the ""greasy"" side, but other than that I heard the flavor was good.

Now that the $1 drink + free entree grand opening promotion is over, we will see if the restaurant can sustain the buzz and continue to draw in a steady flow of customers.  I think at $4.95 (inclusive of tax) it is hard to find a better meal deal cheaper at a sit down restaurant.

And for those who are expecting this to be just another typical Chinese take-out restaurant, you will most likely be disappointed with their menu selection.  You will not find Kung-Pao Chicken or Egg Rolls here. But if you are down to try some different kind of Chinese regional dishes, this is a good place to start without breaking the bank.

------Version 1.0.1 Update------
Came here after hearing about their House Special Shrimp Wontons from Nelson Q and reading his review.  When I arrived I was told that they also have new menu items that just got added today (Beef Ramen, Shrimp Ramen or Udon and Malaysian Beef Curry over Rice).

I was pretty set to try the shrimp wonton, which was pure shrimp in wonton wrapper.  Yum! The Shrimp Wonton Udon also comes with vegetables, so it is a pretty complete meal.

The new Beef Ramen (made with tender braised beef briskets and tendons) was very good.  The beef broth has a nice flavor, and the brisket and tendons were braised for hours until they are perfectly soft and tender.  It also comes with a really generous portion of ramen, the same kind sourced by Monta Ramen. At $5.95 it is a very good deal, based on the combination of taste, portion size and good culinary execution plus the hours and TLC dedicated to braising the chunks of beef brisket and tendons.  I can see this new Big Wong Beef Ramen as the new featured franchise item for the restaurant.

Note:  They also have Japanese ramen noodles, which you can substitute for the odon noodles. It is not on the menu, but the manager told me it is available.

------Version 1.0.2 Update------
Big Wong still serves up solid and wholesome Chinese food, my many repeat visits are proof enough.  One of my favorite is the Steamed Chicken, Mushroom and Chinese Sausage. The congee is great, especially on days when I am not my usual ravenous world devouring self. 
12-1-2011 (Update reminder courtesy of Warren P)
------Version 1.0.2 Update------

Decor:  3/5  More attention was used in fitting the 68 seats in the restaurant than the overall look.

Food:  4/5  Now offering soups, appetizers, congee and even desserts!

Location:  4/5  Pretty convenient for those working, shopping or living near the Chinatown area.

Price:  5/5  $4.95 including tax is a good deal for a full meal.  They are definitely going for volume and not high margin per order.  Great for customers and I hope it works out for the restaurant."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"I was heading to Henderson for an appointment and in an adventurous mood while driving down S. Eastern Ave.  Along the way I looked around for cool places to check out, when the traffic has stopped at traffic lights and it was safe to do of course, for things to do and kind of planning my lunch for the day.

So my first stop was this tiny Asian market that also serves breakfast and boba drinks (it is just next door) and it didn't look too appealing to me.  So I walked next door to Kabob Grill, and reminiscing about the handful of great Persian restaurants I have been referred to try or been taken to in California.  The menu looks simple enough, and they have the basic kabob varieties you expect from a decent Persian restaurant, not to mention one that specializes in kabobs.  And they even have the ground beef kabob (Kabaabe Koobideh) that I prefer over most other items on the menu.  Lunch is already off to a good start!

So after debating if I should get their lunch special or just ordering the same Ground Beef in the Main Dishes section, I went with the Large Main Dishes version of Ground Beef (which is served with rice, onions, pita bread, butter and optional grilled tomato and two skewers of ground beef) at $9.99.  The lunch special version comes with just 1 skewer of meat (except the ""Soltani"" items, which serves two combinations of skewer meats), rice, salad, onions, pita bread and fountain drink with price ranging from $8.49 to $13.49. In general the Main Dishes items are a $1 more than their equivalent in the lunch specials.

I didn't bother to take pictures of the exterior or interior, thinking that other Yelpers surely have reviewed this place already.  So no photos, except the food I ordered.  But I will say that their display case is beautifully stocked with various canned and bottled beverages and some homemade pastries. The menu and the paint scheme on the wall matches, and utilizes the vibrant green, yellow and white colors.  The décor is simple, with black marbled-top tables and matching black cushion chairs arranged around the average size dining area of the restaurant.

Anyway, service is okay. It is just another ""step up to the counter and order your food, wait for it to be prepared and pick it up at the counter when your number is called"" kind of fast casual food service operation. They greet you when you walk in, but not when you have finished your meal and walking out the door.

Food-wise, it looks good. And if you can drool and imagine just how wonderful it tastes just looking at pictures, then they would get 4-5 stars for ""food styling"".  But based on just trying one item out of the 13 they have available in their Main DIshes section of the menu, I would say this is a 3 stars (A-OK) at best.  My ground beef kabob was juicy (always a plus), but flavor and seasoning-wise it was just okay. Just like a McDonald's burger is okay, but not potentially awesome like the much more expensive gourmet burger from Burger Bar, and you are not paying all that much.

BUT I was disappointed that they did not served the ""optional"" grilled tomato, which is clearly shown in the sample photos for the items. I am not sure if you have to specify you want the ""optional"" grilled tomato, or they simply just don't have it (not likely, since they served sliced tomatoes in the salads I see others ordering) or forgot to put it on my plate.  And I have to say the juiciness and sweetness of the tomato really adds to the flavor profile of the dish, and helps cut the feeling of fattiness mouthfeel after consuming some of the kabob.

Value for the money -  2 stars compared to most restaurants in the fast casual category.  But Persian foods have always cost a little more at restaurants, so I guess 3 stars compared to other Persian kabob fast casual restaurants.

Interesting stuff (at least I think it is) - Kabob Burgers. Kabobs served with the onions, sliced tomato and a lettuce stuffed between burger buns.

They also have an interesting Appetizers and Salad menus. Babaganoush looks good in the picture.  And I want to try their inexpensive but still interesting Shirazy Salad (chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, parsley topped with lemon juice and olive oil for $3.99).
 
This is my first Yelp review of a Persian ""restaurant"" in Las Vegas, so I will give it a 3 stars. Par for the course to compare others to, otherwise it would be a 2 stars for not going above and beyond the bare minimal in service, food preparation and omitting item (I want that grilled tomato gosh darn it!) that should come with the food you order.

RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"I love Chinese dumplings!  Especially if the succulent wrappers used to encase the dumpling fillings are hand made and the dumplings are assemble and cook to order. It is a major comfort food category for me. In fact 餃子 boiled dumplings is the first item I have ever personally ordered on my own with lunch money my mom gave me for elementary school in Taipei. It was just a few pennies each and the shop made it and delivered it in a plastic bag to my school with my name on it just in time for lunch break.  I don't remember much about how it tasted, but the memory of having tremendous emotional satisfaction and joy from that simple meal is still very strong.

So while driving to try out a new ramen place a few miles down the street, the light from this new restaurant caught my eye, and I decided to make a quick,but very safe u-turn into the small parking lot in front of Dumpling King.  There are plenty of spaces in the back of the building, in case this restaurant gets super popular in the coming weeks. I was initially afraid that I was dropping in as the restaurant was about to close, since it was fairly empty inside, but looking at their hours of operation, I was relieved to see that I had 1.25 hours left.

I made a quick scan of the restaurant, and pretty much was blinded by all the red color in the restaurant.  Red floral printed seat covers over each chair.  The tablecloth were reddish in color, and the lighting was fairly dim, so yeah I was slightly disoriented from the color red.  I wonder if that is a normal reaction or it is just one of those minor details that made me just a little different from the other 6 odd billion people on this planet (not including the aliens that left zigzag lights over the skies of Hawaii).

Anyway, after picking a nearby table with good lighting for taking food pictures and going over the menu, I eventually found the ""dumpling"" section all the way on the last page under ""Main Food"" and ordered the following:

101. Beef Steamed Dumplings(4) 牛肉蒸餃 - Decent flavor, but I felt the texture of the filling was off. Like it was overground or overworked.

102. Beef Dumplings(4) 牛肉水餃 - Same filling as the above, except this dumpling is boiled.

103. Lamb Dumplings(4) 羊肉水餃 - Good dumpling, nice lamb flavor. Dumpling is also boiled and looks exactly like the Beef Dumpling.

112. Stone Dumplings 水晶餃子 - This is like a big plate full of pot stickers that is cooked in a pan, and inverted onto the plate. The residual starchy water forms a thin crust that connects all of the dumplings together (see the picture).  It is kind of cool looking, but eat these fast.  Because I was taking time to take pictures, and all the food came more or less at the same time, I noticed that a small pool of oil puddle up on the plate after like 10 minutes, which made it taste not as good as the very first piece I had.  Just something to think about if you are dining solo or eat very slowly.

NOTE: Although their menu have prices listed for dumplings with portions of (4), I was told that it was a misprint and now the minimum order is (8) dumplings, so you now need to order those items x2.  But for the Beef and Lamb Dumplings that comes out to (8 pieces) for $5, not too bad price wise, but does present an additional hurdle against trying as much of the menu as possible without asking for the doggie bag.  They did however let me order four pieces of each of the Beef Dumplings and Lamb Dumplings, for a total of eight pieces, since both are cooked the same way.

Overall, I thought the food was A-OK at this family operated restaurant (Mom, and son both works here in the front, and the dad is likely in the kitchen cooking).  It is the closest Chinese dumpling restaurant to where I live for now, so I will be stopping by in the near future.  Plus I asked to see if they also can make Xiao Long Bao, given that they are calling themselves the Dumpling King and serve many of the dumpling specialties from the same region, and was told that they just added that to their menu that day.  Would have been nice to offer up such information when I was reading the menu or at the time I was placing my orders, but oh well. Just another reason to go back. Maybe later for dinner.

Credit cards are accepted here, but when I gave them my AmEx card (there is a AmEx sticker along with the usual suspects on the front door) but was asked to pay with a different card (because American Express charges a higher fee - perhaps, but more likely due to AmEx not distributing the funds to their merchant clients for an entire billing cycle). Yeah, pretty much all the small vendors are hating on AmEx, and to think (if you are old enough) that they once dominated the credit card market. Oh how the mighty has fallen indeed.  

3.5 stars.  I am sure another update will be forth coming should I get to try the XLB on my next visit.

Review #26 of 2014"
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Las Vegas can get so hot most months of the year that you could expect there to be a plethora of frosty dessert options in the city.  For the most part, we do, but the variety of options has been pretty traditional (and some of it very excellent - think Snow Ono).

Thanks to a newish invention out of Taiwan, the Snow Ice (aka: Shaved Snow, Fluff Ice, Snow Cream, Cotton Snow), which has since spread to Hawaii and the other Western States, and now we too finally have our very own authentic snow ice shop in Las Vegas. It is all thanks to Frost Bites Shavery's co-owners Will and Mike (that brought their business from Texas to the Silver State).  Even if it is located all the way out in the boonies for all that lives in the other corners of Las Vegas.  Seriously, following the direction on my GPS, I found myself eventually driving down a road that could easily be mistaken for a typical street in Gilroy or Union City, CA (circa 1987).  It was as if I am not even in Las Vegas any more.

Anyway, back to this Snow Ice dessert place that operates out of a stationary (at the moment) trailer in a parking lot right off of Boulder Highway called Frost Bites Shavery (not to be mistaken for, I know I have, Frost Bite Shaved Ice).  It is not the first to attempt to serve this snow ice dessert in Las Vegas, but it is the most authentic attempt at recreating the same fluffy shaved snow that is very well known in Taiwan and Asia.

After a recent trip to SoCal (Class 302 - the one that actually brought the Snow Ice movement to the US, and Tea Spot - a typical boba tea hangout) and also some comparison tasting of other LV based businesses (which I will not name) that have Snow Ice on their menu, I can say with absolute conviction that Frost Bites Shavery serves up the very best Snow Ice of all the places I visited.

They are the best because:
1) True passion - The people that are making the snow ice dessert are the same guys that invested months to research and perfect it, not some hourly employee that may or may not even know the correct/best practice method of making and serving it.

2) The ingredients used are fresh, not some pre-made mix or formula utilizing artificial flavorings.  So it tastes better (although my brother was very satisfied with the artificial flavoring used to make the taro flavored snow ice at one of the SoCal spots during my taste testing journey).

3) The texture of the dessert is spot on. It has the fluffy, airy, cotton candy melt in your mouth attributes that are found in authentic snow ice desserts. But just like real snow takes awhile to melt compared to ice, this dessert will not turn into a puddle as quickly as the other shaved ice desserts.

4) Compared to even the original from Taiwan, I personally think it is at least on par if not superior to the original because of #2 (fresh ingredients). But no way anyone in the US can compete with fresh ripe and super sweet mango found in Asia, unless you are willing to spend the $$ to next day air freight it over.

5) The choice of flavors (currently 8) is more numerous than the competition.  (Caution: There is not a direct correlation between the number of flavors offered and the business' approval rating)
Green Tea - The best Green Tea flavor shaved snow I have tried of all the places I visited.
Mango - Good, and pairs well with Coconut.
Coconut - Nice flavor, but personally I would love it even more if the coconuts were toasted before infusing.
Black Sesame - Very good, totally great on its own.
Chocolate - reminds me of chocolate Fudgesicles I had when I was in elementary school.  Made with Ghirardelli chocolate.
Vanilla - Made with real vanilla, not imitation flavoring.

6) FBS's dessert is good enough on its own without the toppings or sauces. It is perfect for the snow ice purist.

7) The option of selecting from 4 serving sizes that best suits your individual or party's needs is greatly appreciated. The competition offers just one or two sizes, most are too large for a small child to finish on his/her own.

8) Ability to customize your order (base flavors, toppings), which surprisingly is not always an option at the competition.

9) Price/Value Ratio is better for your wallet.

10) Awesome friendly service. 

So if the fluffy shaved snow is the dessert you are looking for, look no further (although you will likely still have to drive a fair distance to get it in the near future).  If you are looking for the traditional shaved ice, well, this is not it. However, after you give it a try, you might find that you enjoy it just as much if not more.

Final thoughts:  Good marketing and publicity will help make a good product commercially successful sooner. But the opposite is true as well, as nothing will help doom a business or product faster than the same good marketing and publicity.  Just sayin' not hatin'.

Who is gonna host the next UYE at FBS?  Should carpool too."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"I was the first patron in the restaurant when I arrived at 6pm Tues., but the place quickly filled up and the sushi bar was soon at 80+% capacity. Patrons are mostly locals w/ some out of towners from listening to random conversations here and there. The sushi bar is just a small part of the overall square footage of the restaurant, as they also have Teppanyaki. By the time I left the restaurant there were quite a few people having teppanyaki dinner, which may actually be the main incentive to visit this restaurant.

Review based on my experience for their AYCE sushi ($26.95 or $29.13 w/ tax). For party of 4 or more, there is an automatic 18% gratuity added to your bill. This is NOT inclusive of any desserts (i.e., green tea or mocha ice cream) which are the norm of the typical AYCE sushi joints in Las Vegas. But Hikari is not your typical AYCE sushi place, since they feature AYCE sashimi (yellowtail, salmon, tuna and snapper).

The sushi chefs are all Japanese or speak Japanese fluently; this also applies to at least some of the waitresses. If your entire party is not doing the AYCE, the sushi chef will communicate what the non-AYCE person is ordering to the waitress in Japanese, for tab keeping purposes. And of course I think if you go to a AYCE place, you SHOULD do the AYCE, since your bill will quickly add up to make it not worth doing the meal à la carte. And if you think the restaurant is being unreasonable for not allowing you to share food with your non-AYCE buddy/girlfriend, there is a high statistical probability that you are a cheap unreasonable bastard.

Anyway, back to the review.

Service - the waitresses were very good. They are friendly and attentive. When I was done with my plate, it rarely has time to sit idle on the table for long before it is picked up to be washed. Tea refilled regularly. 5 stars.

Sushi Chef - the one that was attending to my orders was good. He asked regularly to make sure I get my orders in while I am still hungry to try more items on their menu. If you are a regular patron, they will remember you by name (based on personal observations).  4-5 stars.

Food - 2.5 stars at best. Overall it wasn't too impressive compared to some of my favorite sushi-ya (à la carte or AYCE). Sushi rice, Hamachi, salmon, and tuna are good benchmark for comparing the quality of the sushi served at sushi bars. They are the most popular items ordered, should be fresh, and your palette should be able to distinguish if it is good or not. I felt the sushi rice can be prepared and seasoned better. My hamachi nigiri was good, but the tuna served on the sashimi combo was definitely NOT. Salmon was alright. But people seated around me were ordering sashimi combos like it was going out of style, so maybe I had the crappy cut and they were served tuna from a better piece of fish.

Amaebi - I ordered it nigiri-style and the 2 baby amaebi on top of each relatively giant clump of sushi rice were miniscule. Highly recommend ordering it sashimi style, because without wasting rice (AYCE no no) you really can't taste the amaebi.

Super White Tuna - regular or spicy. The fish itself was okay, not the best by any means, but the spicy version supposedly served with spicy garlic jalapeño was actually made spicy by Sriracha. It wasn't good enough to order my usual seconds.

Ikura and Uni- Acceptable but portions are small. But Uni wasn't AYCE for me.

Caterpillar Roll - I liked it. Not drowned in Eel Sauce like in many other sushi places. If I go back, I would order it again.

Appetizer menu - overall just A-OK. Some items are better than others, and some should just be avoided.

Seafood Tempura - Batter on the thick side, and I really don't think they dusted in tempura flour before dipping it in the tempura batter before frying, because it didn't stick to some of the seafood. Otherwise, it is good enough to recommend.

Agedashi Tofu - Lacking in flavor.

Shumai - Ok, is served steaming hot. But you can tell these were IQF (Individual Quick Frozen) variety sold to food service operations.

Tempura Fried Soft Shell Crab - Served too quickly that I too think it was previously fried and refried again for faster service, sacrificing quality for speed.

Dynamite - Comes out flaming (literally). Good presentation but otherwise not noteworthy for the palette.

Fried Rice (chicken, vegetable or shrimp) - Tried the shrimp version (1/2 order). Overcooked shrimp, the fried rice itself was good, except maybe a touch heavy handed on the soy sauce.

With so many other AYCE sushi places that I enjoy better, I will likely not return, since the big draw for me is the AYCE Uni, which may no longer be AYCE (at least it wasn't for me).

Location - In the SW corner of W. Flamingo and Buffalo inside Flamingo Village Plaza

Parking - Plenty.

Worth the cab fare from the Strip and back? No

Yelp review - 3 stars and it is mostly due to the excellent service and NOT the food."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Came here last evening to check out the HH (4:30pm to 6:30pm) with some of the local Yelp/Instagram/foodie friends. Thanks Nikki (aka @misohungry_vegas) for taking the initiative to organize this casual get together. I probably would still be in the dark about this new restaurant on E. Flamingo (between Lawry's The Prime Rib and McCormick & Schmick's Seafood & Steaks), waiting for Yelp to alert me to this hot new restaurant.

The restaurant's high ceiling, the huge murals, the open kitchen design, centrally-accessible well-stocked bar, lots of exterior floor-to-ceiling glass windows with natural lighting for that natural lighting all food bloggers love, yeah, the decor and interior design of the restaurant are amazing. The restaurant signage out front almost felt too subtle, at least during the day time.

Anyway, yesterday was another scorcher just like the preceding EDC weekend, except it was a few degrees warmer in the open oven we called Summer in Las Vegas. So in spite of having the car AC on full blast, I was quickly wilting away on the drive over and was very appreciative of Bandito's demonstration of the marvels of industrial air conditioning, essential to survival in this present state of daily excessive heat warning.

So once we were inside and greeted warmly by the host, who walked us over to our table, our waitress introduced herself and recommended their Bandito Margarita (just $5 during HH), which we both declined. Sorry, not a drinker. But the ones our friends ordered when they arrived shortly looks great in those colorfully sparkly glasses it was served in. They liked it and all opted for a second round.

As far as our food order, we ordered from their HH special (1/2 off appetizers), and the only item we wanted to try but didn't order was the octopus (86 from the menu for the night since the quality did not meet the chef's standard).

Queso Bandito ($4 HH). Pretty cheesy, but we failed at our attempted cheese porn. When it was dropped off at our table, the cheese was really hot making it way too runny, so it thwarted our effort to contribute to the hashtag meltedcheese, hashtag cheeseporn, hashtag cheesepull communities. But the caramelized part on the edges are extra yummy.

Chicken Flautas was a solid hit ($6 HH). The five of us easily K.O. this fried appetizer, the way Samuel Peter KO Jeremy Williams in the second round of their 2004 NABF title match. Poor Flautas.

My personal favorite is the cheesy Chicken Quesadilla ($6 HH). Every Mexican restaurant serves it, but not many does it the way Bandito's does it. And as a public service announcement for all the food bloggers even thinking about getting that perfect melted cheese porn action for their social media account and their followers viewing pleasure, let me just remind you of that popular and over used phrase ""No pain, no gain.""

Guacamole ($4). You get a sizable mound of it on a small dish. It was good. I would have loved to be able to order this while mindlessly chipping away at it with the complimentary chips and salsas, while watching the 2017 NBA Finals! #Dubnation!!!  But we ordered a lot of food and some came with guacamole too, so surprisingly the guacamole survived all 10 rounds. There was even a tablespoon worth left on the plate, since everyone was too polite to finish it.

Seafood Ceviche ($6 HH). Beautifully presented with the shrimp, baby scallops, white fish forming a small mound topped with its garnishes. It is a simple and refreshing dish to eat in this heat, but the simple plate of seafood makes for a surprisingly challenging subject to photograph. Just imagine if there is a gallery that have all the photos ever taken throughout the entirety of time of just Bandito's Seafood Ceviche, it would be pretty easy to identify who has either the talent or skill of a photographer, and it would be interesting to see how the really good ones frame and shot their picts. Wow, that was totally random :p

Let's see we also ordered a Nacho ($5 HH), with a Carne Asada add-on (extra $4). There was a mix up and we ended up with a Carnitas one as well. The nachos are huge and definitely meant for sharing. But you certainly can order it all for yourself if that's  your thing, in which case I would definitely get the guacamole plus add on a protein and really make it a meal. Needless to say, we failed to slay the nacho dragons.

The group's HH get together was wallet friendly too. The total bill was only $70, that's including 6 Bandito's Margaritas (HH). Perfect for a cheap Tinder date, which I wouldn't know anything about since I refuse to be forced to sign up witching FB (even a fake one just for all the annoying apps on the FB authentication bandwagon).

I shall end this 4 star review here, since there are plenty of TMI inserted in the review already.  Stay hydrated, don't give the excessive heat a chance to score that KO my friends! And watch out for one another. Hashtag TheEnd"
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Was at Greenland Supermarket for lunch with a friend. Saw sign for fro-yo at a new place from the parking lot.  Grabbed lunch from Island Style #2. See bunch of peeps walking out with hefty portions of shaved ice, while waiting for our food. Made up mind to go check it out after our lunch.  That is the quick and dirty status update of this review.

Fast forward 30-40 minutes. Lunch finished. We went to this latest food court addition. I swear Greenland gets better and better almost after each visit. And here's the basic facts/observations of the business called ""Tiffany's Gourmet Coffee"":

1) Address is 6850 W.Spring Mountain Rd #12, Las Vgeas, NV 89146
2) Located in the SE corner of the food court, with entry from the food court or directly from the parking lot.
3) Menu: Coffees, Fruit Smoothies, Shaved Ice, Sandwiches, and Fro-Yo.
4) Limited seating ~3-4 small tables within the shop and plenty outside in the food court section. No outdoor seating at this time (but it is also 110F out right now)
5) Middle age Korean Owner, Tiffany, works in the shop and prepares orders such as shaved ice.
6) At least 1 other employee that works the register and prepares the beverage orders.
7) The first day of business was Saturday, July 17, 2010.
8) Cute, friendly Asian females work here, including the owner's daughter (from listening to conversations while I waited for my order to be made).
9) You may receive even better service if you can converse in Korean, just like inside Greenland Supermarket (especially at the meat counter).

So now that is out of the way, here is short version of what happened on my first visit:
Tried to order fro-yo, but it is not available yet.  Then I tried to get shaved ice, but machine stopped working. Friend wanted to go to Yogurtland on Flamingo. End of discussion.

Next day, I stopped by again after work to check this place out and perhaps write a review. The Yelp god(dess) must be smiling down at me, first for accepting me into the Elite squad (as I would later find out), and fixing Tiffany's shaved ice machine. Hooray!

Their 5 items shaved ice menu: Tiffany's Deluxe ($5.95), Tiffany's Family Size Deluxe ($8.95), House Special ($4.95), Green Tea ($5.95), and Coffee ($5.95). 

Nice and simple. But without pictures or descriptions it is hard to tell what you are going to get with your orders. The friendly Asian girl did her best to describe the items and the sizes for inquisitive customers. So I decided to order the Green Tea, which they are out. Okay, how about Coffee? Nope, that is out too. Darn, 2 strikes already. Tiffany's Deluxe, which I was told come in the bigger bowl, sounds like a better deal than the House Special, was what I ended up ordering.

While waiting for my order, I see Tiffany slicing up bananas, kiwi and mango, and working the temperamental shaved ice machine. First shaved ice completed was not for me, so I waited some more and observed what she was doing. First, some shaved ice, then drizzle some syrup or evaporated milk(???), condensed milk, more shaved ice, repeat the layering of syrup/evaporated milk and condensed milk, shaved ice... finally the sesame powder, blueberries, sliced bananas, kiwi, mango, strawberries, red beans, boba, green beans(???), mochi, drizzle more syrup/evaporated milk, condensed milk and chocolate syrup. The finished product was time consuming to make, but looks fantastic!

The fruits were all fresh and tasty. The boba was alright. The red beans was good. Overall, I was very satisfied with the order. Took a few minutes to prepared, but I was in no hurry, however, the process of making it needs to be streamlined to meet the increase orders I am forecasting.

Suggestions to owner:
1) Have sample pictures to show customers for menu items, such as the shaved ice.
2) Signage in the store informing customers that their fro-yo is not yet available, until it is. Nothing worse than making up your mind to have fro-yo or any item, only to find out that it is out or otherwise unavailable. Its a psychology thing.
3) No need to layer the shaved ice and the syrup/evaporated milk thing, it will all melt together or seep down anyways. Plus it will cut back on the time to prepare it.

My ratings:

Overall - 4 stars!
Location - 5 stars (very close and convenient from home and commute back from work)
Parking - 4 stars (big parking lot, but might have to park a few spots out when the supermarket and food court is busy.
Ambiance - 3-4 stars (not too many seats inside the shop itself, and seats are not the super comfortable kind but does its job.
Menu - 3 stars (nothing too exotic, just a simple menu of coffee related beverages, fruit smoothies, Korean style shaved ice, sandwiches, and frozen yogurts to be rolled out at a later date)
Flavor - 4 stars (I like my shaved ice, but I think I would like the Green Tea even more if it was available)

So, there you have it. Go check it out and support this new local small business."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Disclaimer:  Attended the soft opening as one of the Facebook Pre-Opening RSVP Invited Guests on 11/14/2017.  With the Yelp check-in for a complimentary beverage, everything on this visit was comped (including my second bowl of Mentai Cream Udon)

----------
Personal pet peeve rant: Please do not pronounce UDON like Ming Tsai (for an Asian guy that lived and worked in Japan before becoming a TV chef, it is disrespectful to purposely mispronounce a common Japanese noodle dish that he probably ate numerous times after work.  He is not some guy that might have lived their entire life having never traveled more than 30 miles in any one direction on a farm in Ohio. Udon is not pronounced U-Don.
Don't trust the pronunciation provided by the US-based search engines either.  Search Youtube for ""うどん pronounciation"" for the Japanese pronunciation. Or just ask the staff that works at Café Sanuki.
----------

The display of life like menu items made of plastic in the glass display definitely reminded me of the Japanese restaurants my parents took me to when I was growing up in Taiwan and visited on vacations in Japan, S.Korea and even Thailand.  It is not as common nowadays, especially in Nevada, probably due to the cost of these boarder line works of art. But having a visual representation of what you can expect to receive before ordering is nearly priceless. Plus photos, even really really good ones, can only do so much.  Bonus points for that authenticity feel!

So after I verified that I was at the right address, by stepping back into the parking lot to double check the signage on the outside of the building, I was immediately greeted by two lovely hostesses with a clipboard to check in.  I was given a laminated voucher to redeem at the cashier, and suggested to check out the fresh udon being prepared by a machine right on the other side of the glass partition.  The machine is a sheeter, that rolls the dough into the desired thickness, and then feed through the machine to be cut into individual thick strips of udon noodles.  After it is cut, the udon is dusted with some type of flour (guessing wheat flour) to keep it from sticking together, and toss into boiling water to cook for just a brief period of time.  Very simple process.

The tricky part is deciding what to order in this cafeteria-style udon-bar restaurant. Just looking at their menu, they appear to have at least 16 Udon preparations to satisfy your need for udon noods. Plus 4 options of Rice Bowls (Options: Beef, Curry, Chicken & Egg, and Miso Garlic Pork Belly in regular and mini size options). After placing your udon orders, there are also tempura-fried appetizers that can be selected to compliment your udon entrée.  Plus they have 8 different Onigiri (Japanese Rice Balls with different fillings: Spicy Tuna, Tuna Mayo, Salmon, Spam, Mentai, Plum, Kunbu, and Inari), and in the near future Oden selections and Taiyaki (a type of dessert in the shape of a baked fish (sea bream) cake with traditionally filled with Japanese red bean paste filling.

What I ended up ordering are #11 Seafood Tomato Cream and #12 Mentai Cream Udon.  Both of these udon entrees are served in oversized bowls (large enough to fit probably the Costco pack of 2 watermelons or a basketball), which then made the udon portions look deceptively tiny. Plus one of the hostess also asked if I wanted to try a mini Rice Bowl, which I could not refused. And while waiting to get to the cashier, I also picked up a single tempura-fried shrimp (pretty good and the shrimp is not the tiny pinky-sized shrimps often served at the lower-end Japanese or AYCE sushi restaurants) on a tray next to the other tempura-fried appetizers and Japanese ""fritters"" often served on the side to compliment the udon noodles.

Overall, I thought the price range is reasonable ($5.50 to $9.95), even without the soft opening 30% off discount, and the selection of udon noodles toppings and preparation are pretty extensive.  Plus there is the option to serve some of the udon entrees cold instead of hot, just like in Japan and numerous iconic dishes from around the globe during the summer or winter (e.g., Vichyssoise, aka Potato Leek Soup).  The biggest appeal, besides the convenient location (Decatur and Spring Mountain), is that it is a fast, relatively healthy meal on a short lunch break or for dinner after a long day at work.

Also they have one of those fancy Coke Freestyle Soda Machines with the touch sensitive monitor that you can navigate to dispense up to 144 different beverages. Plus they also have 5 flavors of fresh brew Harney & Sons fruit teas and 8 different syrups to further customize your drinks.  But I totally recommend not trying any of that, especially the sodas, until you have tried Café Sanuki's House Blend Lemonade (it is not too sweet, have a pleasant citrus note that I can not quite place).

Give them a try, before Café Sanuki gets too popular and the wait is long.

4 stars!"
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Great wine menu for wine lovers and their 50% off wine selection promotions are on every Mondays.  Grape Street is a popular place to dine at without breaking the bank, unless you want to (even then it will be a challenge).  Pretty dark/dim lighting, ideal if you don't want to see your food before consuming it, even better if you must dine with someone you absolutely can't stand looking at.  Awesome hostess!

Well, I went on a Tuesday (1 day before the Groupon I purchased several months ago expires) and called ahead to see if I needed to make a reservation.  I was told they only take reservation for larger parties (I believe 6, maybe 8) but to come down since they were not busy.  So I took a quick nap, and ended up over there around 6:45pm, and the place was packed with people waiting in the non-existent lobby/waiting area near the hostess podium.

I was told the wait will be a 45 minutes, so I left my number and went to read in my car (it was way too cold to be seated outside or walking about checking out what other businesses are in the same plaza). The hostess must have some magical talents, because like magic or a clever charm, she shrunk the wait time to around 8 minutes and delivered the good news over the phone.  Sweet!!!    +1 star right there!

I was seated at a small table in a dimly lite part of the restaurant, which is not bad, but not great if you are a Yelper and photodocument your experience.  Luckily field testing the iPhone 4S in low light condition with ""flash"" was a reasonable success.

Service was pleasant, even at max capacity, albeit not as speedy as it might have been on nights when they are not so slammed with guests.  Which gave me plenty of time to read the menu and research for suggestions on Yelp.  (The baked brie was indeed a great community suggestion!)

So this is what I ended up ordering:

* Baked Brie in Puff Pastry Shell ($13) with chopped Hazelnut, Caramelized Onions and Apricot Preserve, served with Apple wedges and Grapes, and really big slices of french breads.  The baked brie itself was wonderful and nom nom nom goodness! It was large enough to share amongst four people, or even better having it all to yourself. The presentation however needs refinement (toasted bread slices way too thick, and a knife stabbed in the pastry is anything but refine).  4 stars for taste, 1.5 stars for presentation.  Recommended.

* Seafood Fradiavolo ($20) - clams, shrimp,calamari, scallops & mussels are blended in a spicy tomato sauce or a white garlic and oil sauce and served atop linguine.  I went with the white garlic sauce, which I was told was the more popular option.  Shrimp was overcooked, and the scallops was a 1/4"" thick slice, which are my only main non-positive reaction, to a pretty good tasty entree. 3 stars for the taste and presentation.  Recommended if you like seafood and pasta.

* Chicken Marsala Dinner ($22) - thinly pounded chicken sauteed in Marsala wine sauce, served with mushrooms, baby carrots and potatoes (Online menu said it is served with rice pilaf).  The chicken was absolutely tender and cooked perfectly!!!  The baby carrots and potatoes were likewise expertly executed in the kitchen.  However, I am not a fan of this version of the Marsala Wine Sauce, which I thought was too one-dimensionally sweet and generally lacking in complexity of flavors contributed by the use of herbs and seasoning.

All dinner comes with choice of small house salad or soup, and I opted for the salad.  It was decent, with the raspberry dressing (standard) or can be customized with your specified dressing.

Had room for dessert, but was saving room for the Sushi Mon10th Anniversary $10 AYCE promo the next day.  (Which ended up falling through, due to the overwhelming Occupy Sushi Mon Movement) 

Location:  Close to the 95 and Summerlin Parkway.

Parking:  4/5  Plentiful, but there are little to no shades in this parking lot to minimize the hot summer sun.

Service:  4.5/5
5 stars alone for the Hostess, as she was simply awesome!  I am sure she did her best to seat patrons as quickly as possible,and turned a 45 minute wait to just ~5-8 minutes on a busy night.  She follows up after themeal on the food your ordered and asks how it was, that alone is unheard of!!!  She deserves every penny the restaurant pays her and more.

4 stars for the waiter and the runner that brought out and cleared away my plates.  The only reason it is not 5 stars also, is the minor reason that all the main courses (I ordered two for myself) were delivered to the table at the same time.  I guess I will have to make a point to specify that in the future, as I am pretty sure they don't often have guests order that much food.

Food:  3/5 Above average.

Price:  4/5  Reasonable.

Overall, it was a good dining experience and I can see why it is a popular destination.  The waitstaff and the hostess were friendly and basically awesome, especially in consideration of how busy they were when I went."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Very good Korea BBQ at a very reasonable prices for both lunch and dinner. The only major drawback is the location, since it is located at the Galleria Mall (across the street from Sunset Station), which can be a rather long drive for anyone not working/living in this part of Las Vegas.

Gen Korean Barbecue House has just opened 2 weeks ago. Still in their soft opening phase and running their promotion (free AYCE dinner for first 50 guests starting at 3pm). I actually have been here twice during this promotion (the second time I didn't know the promotion is still active and was guest number 39 of 50 on Sept 1, 2015). And my coworker that I was meeting also arrived and received the same promo voucher.

There seems to be a lot servers/crew working on my first two visits. From what I have learned from casual interviews of the crew serving us, they have experienced managers and seasoned servers working here to train the new employees, so guest experiences can quickly improved to the level one can expect to received at their other established locations in California.  As is, the servers are all very friendly and tries to be as proactive about providing the best customer service as they can (almost never had to ask for beverage refills or grill change). 

I prefer to have regular cooking oil brushed on the new grill (only happened twice without prompting), or they would squeeze sesame oil (low smoke point so it would completely burn off before the grill gets hot enough to grill properly) afterwards. But when I requested regular cooking oil, they did fill a bottle from the kitchen to accommodate my request. I guess some of their other guests does not want the extra oil, so it is by request.

Most guests that goes to this type of cook it yourself KBBQ knows and enjoy the interactive cooking experience. It is one of the best part of the meal in my opinion, but I am usual the designated grill master anyway. But if you can't cook or prefer the crew cook it for you, they will (but how well it turns out will vastly differ depending on their individual skills, as I doubt any of these kids have any formal culinary training). But seriously, it is not that hard to master once you learn to adjust the intensity of the flame while grilling your meats & seafood.

They have most of your typical KBBQ meats, seafood and vegetables. But menu offering varies slightly by locations, if you have had previous dining experience at other Gen KBBQ locations. To minimize waste, you can order up to 4 meat dishes a la carte, which servers bring to you already portioned on plates. My favorite here is their No.10 Gen Yangyum Galbisal (Marinated Premium Steak), which I literally orders at least one each round. Their Chicken Bulgogi is excellent, but you really have to know how to grill these extra thick pieces of chicken without undercooking them or burning the outside or cooking it to its excessively dried unappetizing death. Cutting it to thinner slices on medium flame is recommended. The Beef Brisket & Beef Tongue is good and cooks super fast (unfortunately no half orders if you want less, like when you go by yourself). Their Pork Belly is basically thick slabs of bacon (options of plain, miso or red wine marinated). Shrimps are good and cooks relatively quickly, but your hands will get dirty peeling them afterwards (or bring your Bae that will peel it for you. The things people do for love).

As far as appetizers, their salad is a must. Helps balance out the artery clogging yumminess of all the grilled meats. The Pork Cutlet is decent. The Fried Calamari is yum. Seaweed Salad is on par with sushi restaurants. KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) was disappointing, at least for me, since it really just reminds me of their variation on boneless Orange Chicken. Truffle Fries looks interesting (but it was not available on my first visit). Spicy Korean Rice Cake has a nice crispiness to it, but I recommend sauce on the side for this one.

Even if AYCE is not worthwhile for you or you just don't feel like smashing your diet plans for half a week, they have Premium Box Lunch Specials ($7.95 to $9.95).

As far as desserts. Currently they don't have anything, unless you count their Potato Salad (will already be at the table when the hostess seats you). But Macaron Ice Cream Sandwhich(es) will be available after their soft opening phase. Can't wait to try that.

So if you are still with me after all those paragraphs, I  hope you find this review informative. Would I recommend it? Yes! Are there room for improvements? Of course, but they are already doing a bang up job so far and it should be even better in the months ahead. Price wise, it is very competitively priced. If they actually open a second Vegas location in a more centrally accessible venue, they will easily put major dents in their competitors gross sales and customer count.

In closing, keep up the good job Gen KBBQ House & welcome to Las Vegas!

*Use of iPad very helpful in checking orders."
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"Before getting into the review let's start with some fun factoids, trivia and pro tips.

1) To avoid confusion with duplicate names being used, ladies must all submit a list of their 20 preferred stage names which management would check against their database for availability. So chances are slim that any dancers with popular stage names such as Britney, Candy, Anastasia, Angel, Coco, Jade, or Brandy would still be spring chickens in this entertainment circle.

2) Dancers are independent contractors that must have proper permits from the county to even work at Gentlemen's Clubs and must pay a house fee to work there each day. 

3) House fees are lower if dancers arrived during the early/day shift and goes up (usually at 9pm) when the venue typically gets busier. There are opt-out fees for not having to dance on stage, for venues where stage work is mandatory.

4) Popular figures or names, beverages (wine and spirits), gemstones, geographic locations, food, herbs and spices are often the sources of inspiration for stripper stage names.

Pro Tips:

1) Drive your self or call for their free limo service to avoid paying door fees that are split with the cab drivers.

2) Bring plenty of $20s, $1s or exchange for them with the cashier.

3) Be organized with the different bills you have in your pocket. To avoid unintentionally giving a $50 instead of a $20 for a dance. Yes, I did that last night and I was not even drunk. In fact don't even bring $50s.

4) If you don't know the drink prices, order your first round of drinks directly from the bartender to get that info, this will help you avoid being potentially ripped off by the occasional self tipping waitresses.

5) Bring what you expect to spend for your night of entertainment and leave the ATM card at home. Considered what you leave with at the end of the night as what the house failed to win from you.

So with that out of the way, let's get more serious with this review.

Spearmint Rhino (SR), for years it was one of the top 3 gentlemen's clubs that we would visit for friend's bachelor's party weekend celebrations or CES trips, then we started running out of bachelors getting hitched and skipping out on CES. Then newer clubs opened and we kind of stopped visiting or favored other ones.

Then I moved to Vegas, and rarely go to the strip clubs unless out of town friends are visit Vegas for work or volleyball tournaments. And on one of those recent visits someone suggested going to SR and called the house number for VIP entry for driving ourselves there during the recent remodeling. The host helped us get a table and seats after we were comped the entry fee. The ladies were typically quit nice and friendly, and my friends all enjoyed themselves.

So this past weekend when I received a group text with plans we hit up Sapphire for a coworker's birthday, I was like ""let's call the SR main phone number for VIP entry"". But in consideration of our female coworkers that said they were going, we opted for the biggest strip club in the world. That's until the last minute ""sorry I don't think I'm going to make it"" messages started coming in. So in the end it was SR for the win.

We arrived about 6:40pm. Totally awesome ratio of ""Nightlife Entertainment Consultants"" to male patrons ratio. But many of the smaller rooms/areas were closed off, until it got busier later in the night.  So soon after we found a vacant table with a few chairs to sit in, 2 ladies sat with us and started a lengthy conversation with our birthday boy and 2 more joined the fray so as not to leave the others feeling neglected. We took turns buying dances for the birthday boy, but the 2 ladies promoting going to VIP room eventually left without fulfilling their primary mission objective.

Without realizing it, it was 9pm, and there were noticeably more new dancers that arrived. One was a very attractive petite model from Kiev, Ukraine, but her energy was off and the dance felt awkward. Then I met an aspiring actress that have minor roles in films and searchable on IMDB, she was the birthday boy's favorite. And despite being picky, I was glad that eventually a 1/2 Filipino 1/2 Vietnamese total stunner came by to say hi, and I willingly said good bye to 10 dances worth of time sponsored by the Lakers not getting beat up as much by the Cavaliers as the oddsmakers thought parlayed with a few other earlier NBA games.

In the end, we left SR after clocking in almost a full day of work before midnight with plans to come back to celebrate the next special occasion.

So while drafting this review I was trying to think of least favorite or funny stage names that would make people inadvertently snort out their rum and coke through their noses if the DJ were to call them to the main stage, and here are my 6:

1) Pistachio
2) Linguine (by the way speech recognition continues to think I am trying to say ""link weenie"")
3) Turmeric
4) Chernobyl
5) Hillary Clinton
6) Panties (Dragon Ball Z fans might love it though)"
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"They (countless Internet people with sexy six-pack abs I follow on Twitter & Instagram) say that the secret to having a six-pack abs is not the workout sessions at the gym, but mostly (let's say 75%) because of what you eat.  With that said, all the gym rats and fitness minded folks with goals of obtaining or maintaining their six-packs, you do not have to avoid the SLS Buffet... on your cheat day.

The rest of the people that are normal (even extra normal) and more well rounded (pun intended) in the waistline department, come as often as you like (Note: You can earn 2 complimentary SLS Buffet passes with 500 slot points).  Having a few meals here will definitely help you maintain your corpulent rotundness, making you just that much more beloved by Jenny Craig. 

So I know I been watching what I eat recently. So if it wasn't for the SLS grand opening and the ""obsession?"" to check out new places and leave a trail blazer report for the rest of the Yelp Pals, my better judgement would have grounded me and kept me on my granola with dried blueberries diet.  But I suck at being rational when it comes to food and women. So here I am at home now, writing my review.

First of all, SLS being the latest casino property to open to the general public in LV (as of Aug 23, 2014), with nice modern facelift to update what used to be the Sahara, of course has a modern looking buffet.  It is not huge or fancy like Caesar's Bacchanal Buffet, but it is still way better than the one at the Palms.  On opening weekend, the dinner is $40.  So it is not cheap. But still in the same ballpark as the rest of the also ran buffet contenders.

The dining area and also the serving stations look pretty good.  The decorations seems (okay, not gonna sugar coat it), is half complete for the serving stations.  The shelves above is only decorated on about 60% of the buffet (Asian dim sum section to just past the mid point (carving station). Not sure if it was a budget thing, or not getting in all the decorations elements (enameled cast iron cookware), but the bulk of the decoration is noticeably lopsided. Not a big thing, and will not affect the quality of the food served, but it is just one of those attention to details thing.  The seats and tables in the dining area is comfortable and spaced well, so you do not feel cramped or boxed in (Good job!).

The buffet has the usual snow crab legs, some fresh clams, cooked shrimp, prime rib carving station (prime rib was good), dessert station (it is a large island of baked goods, not too much variety though, with some special highlights I will discuss later), a large Asian & dim sum section.  But overall I was not really impressed.  No serious WOW factor. But it is not terrible either.  Pretty A-Okay,with definite room for easy & significant improvements.

Let me cover what I do like about this buffet.

* Layout of the savory stations is straight forward. No lines per say to wait, just go in for the prize, wherever you see what caught your gleaming eyes.
* Plenty of large plates on the bottom shelf for you to pick up and pile on your build your own feast.
* Small portions available for self service, which is refreshed with newer back ups. So you get fairly fresh dishes throughout your meal.
* The line was very short. Hardly any wait, but you do have to look for the buffet or wonder successfully to this part of the SLS property.

* Fresh fried doughnuts tossed in cinnamon sugar. [Highlight of the meal]

* Dried Blueberries [Not sure what you would eat this with, but I was happy to just snack on these plain]
* Sushi was fresh.
* Pastas are all good.
* Gelato was tasty & serving was generous (compared to all the buffets I tried further south of SLS).

Could be better:

* Crepe maker's skill is really at the novice of novice level.  I think he is dreading it, and it shows in the final odd shaped product. The batter is spread thin and overcooked in sections, while thick and under-cooked in others.
* Crepe station ingredients are not stored properly for service or needs to be reformulated. (Chocolate and Nutella are so thick you can't portion it let alone make designs with them. Mixing it with 10% oil or holding it at higher temperature (melting point) would make more sense.
* Dim Sum section has great variety but sometimes you just like a lot of shumai (just an example). So should I leave with 3 bamboo steaming baskets or just consolidate right there.
* Dim sum portions for some items seems too big (chicken feet, the steam buns), I know I opted out, since I don't want to waste food.
* Steamed Basmati rice was dried and crusty. Maybe smaller portions is better or have a cover for it.
* Dessert selections is fairly limited. It looks full, but the same desserts are scattered on almost all sides of the large dessert island.

For $40 (weekend dinner) I thought it was okay, and worth checking out for the sake of checking it out (even some SLS employees agreed).  $30 is a no brainer. $35 is a toss up. 3 stars!"
RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,"One of my foodie friends suggested organizing a group diner at H2O for AYCE sushi on FB Messenger, but I wasn't sure if they ended up going or not. Then a different foodie friend asked if I was free for lunch tomorrow (Oct 15), and I said sure without knowing where we were going or who else was going. That's the shortened version of how I caught the last day of H2O Sushi & Izakaya's grand opening promotion of BYGO AYCE dinner promo at this beautiful and Las Vegas' very newest sushi restaurant that opened right next to Bandito Latin Kitchen & Cantina in the Howard Hughes Center (near the new Claim Jumper location).

Upon arrival, you instantly noticed the modern glass and metal exterior of the restaurant below their name. A few people were waiting outside (weather was very pleasant and not too sunny), but a lot more were waiting just inside the restaurant for their turn to be seated. And I was told by one of my friends that arrived ahead of me that the wait is expected to be about 40 minutes. Not too bad, but the long wait is starting to feel like SoCal dining scene.

The interior of the restaurant is large, with decor and design that immediately reminded me of the Gen KBBQ that opened in Henderson. They have the same freezer with the macaroon ice cream sandwiches at Gen. Even their menu layout and design looks strikingly similar to those of Gen. My friend messaged me afterwards that H2O and Gen are indeed owned by the same corporate owner.

So the social media campaign for H2O's grand opening was a huge success.  Definitely a lot of people showed up.  Even before we were able to order or first round of food from the slip of paper (seems to be the way most Cali Japanese AYCE restaurants handle orders), we already noticed a few blue markers marked on the paper (which are the items that are sold out already in the afternoon), so no unagi (fresh water eel), pork belly and kurobuta sausage yakitori, Tatsuta Age Chicken (fried chicken), Furikake French Fries and Udon noodles, and Spider Rolls.  And just so you know, there are no uni (sea urchin) or amaebi (sweet shrimp) on the menu at all!  Not limited to one order per person, like many of their peers in LV.  

So knowing that the restaurant will very likely struggle with the amount of orders the kitchen will be receiving, we opted to order most of what we expected to eat in the first round.  The food did take noticeably longer to come out, and eventually not everything we ordered came out since the paper got lost.  It is grand opening weekend. And stuff like this happens regularly even in established restaurants, so I am not going to freak out and rate them two stars.  Plus, they did come back and asked us what was still missing from the first round of our orders and eventually those items were delivered to our table.

We ordered all 4 carpaccio options to share.  Our favorite was definitely the Salmon Carpaccio.  Next I thought the Seared Garlic Tuna Carpaccio was very good.

We also ordered all the nigiri sushi, except Spicy Albacore (having it served as carpaccio already, and Krab (imitation crab) and Fresh Water Eel (sold out, otherwise we would definitely ordered it).  Again the Salmon was by far the best, which we ordered again in the second round.  The Shrimp, not the typical pre-cooked and prep thin flat ones that can and are often ordered by most other sushi restaurants, was a surprising stand out (I hope they don't go cheap and switch down the road).  Also terrific were Jalapeno Yellowtail, Seared Garlic Tuna, Octopus, the Salmon Egg. And the fish to rice ratio is definitely customer friendly. So no ordering miso soup and getting rid of extra rice that way!  If I know of this trick, you can bet the restaurant does too.

For the specialty rolls, we ordered H20 Special Roll and Rose Roll, but was also served the Albacore Lover Roll by mistake (we ate it without questioning if we had ordered it) and it was actually one of my favorite item from their menu.  The garnish of lightly fried crispy tempura-battered onions was the best.  I even tried to order that on its own as an appetizer, but sadly that request was shutdown by the kitchen.  So if you order just one specialty roll, I highly recommend that you go with Albacore Lover.

We also ordered Ultimate Salmon Roll in our second roll, but I can tell that the restaurant must be running low on their fantastic Salmon by then, as the amount of Salmon served on top of the roll was anything but ""ultimate"". It was still good, just not as aesthetically pleasing as the one pictured on their menu.

What else can I add to the review?  Just more facts, I suppose.

Premium AYCE price per person:
$19.95 for weekday lunch (excludes holidays) until 3pm
$25.95 for dinner
Kids under age 13 for $13.95
They also have items in their a la carte menu that is not available for AYCE, which does look worth a try in future visits.

18% gratuity will automatically be charged for party of 6 or more.

2 hour limits (better than most)"

a top, and, it is high.  This place is as old as it was built, plus the deal the food is rationed you are not getting good portions, there is no desert or drinks included, and there is an 18% gratuity plus.  This place is not accessible for the disabled or the

The Ceasar Salad is not  real  Ceasar  it is made with pretzels and kale and a vinegar dressing (awful), the buns are VERY SALTY cannot eat them, the chicken which is $28 is a small piece sitting on top of a small glob of PUREE (AWFUL).

The popcorn is not free it is $6.00 and no refills at all.  The food is $12.00 and up, and don't forget, A MUSHROOM BURGER IS NOT A BURGER, ACCORDING TO THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT THERE.  EVERYTHING IS MISLEADING and the management makes you look like you are the crazy one.  When we received the mushroom burger with no burger they laughed at us. We said if it is a mushroom burger, then it is a burger with mushrooms.  According to them it is a mushroom only on a bun, NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN ALL MY LIFE.

uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"The name itself will make you want to start singing...I feel a song coming on...""Big wheel keep on turnin' Proud Mary keep on burn in' Rollin', rollin', rollin' on the river...""

The kids had been begging to go to the ""giant ferris wheel"" so we finally made it. Honestly, at first I couldn't wait to visit this new tourist destination, but as the summer ""rolled"" along, I thought, ""Ugh, 30 minutes in a ball in the heat?""  I was wrong!  And I'm so glad I'm the mommy robot and do what my kids want because this was a winner!

We took advantage of the daytime rates, kids under 12 free rates, and a locals discount rate!  No military rate. 

We walked up to the window and bought our tickets-no line and friendly friendly service by all the staff members...family of four only $33! Woo-hoo!

We zoomed up the escalators and found a beverage bar and restrooms to use prior to boarding.  You can take drinks with you too.

We were very lucky, on this day most folks were watching the World Cup Soccer match when USA was playing-so it was a ghost town.  Staff was very friendly and directed us into our own air-conditioned pod! Woo-hoo! 

The ""ferris wheel"" is the largest observation wheel in the world.  It moves very slow, with non-stop playing music (it's actually the same music heard in the Linq shopping area).  

A non-stop video guides you and your informed how high you are and other safety features.  Since we had the entire pod to ourselves we decided to dance, take pictures and just have fun.  It went by very quickly and the views were incredible of the entire city.

The kids loved it, however, one of my kids did have some anxiety and felt that the ""ball was going to fall off."" I suddenly realized he had a fear of heights!  This was a new revelation.  I was happy that we had the pod to ourselves because we could slowly work towards the window and take our time (30 minutes) to let him enjoy the sights and calm down his anxiety and fear.  Upon the ride ending he was ready to go on again and said he would be brave next time!  AAAAhhhh.  So I guess we will be going back!

Don't miss and take advantage of these great summer rates!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"I use to love the little Fideo soup they used to give us gratis at the beginning of the meal but sadly that custom has died and gone to Fideo heaven:( unless that's just a dinner thing?  

Coming from Phoenix I had never seen Fideo served at a Mexican food restaurant so I knew this place was authentic! In Mexico my tia's use to make Fideo a few times a week.  It's a brothy noodle soup with a few simple ingredients that's so yummy!

Since I had company from out town, they always like to go eat Mexican and compare to restaurants back home.  I have been to this location a few times in the past and have always been a fan. I thought this would be the perfect place to stop by for lunch.

In the back of the restaurant, there's a viewing area to the kitchen where a giant comal is displayed so you can watch someone making homemade tortillas so this was a treat walking by as we were being seated. 

Hostess was friendly and sat us at the table I picked-luckily I had that option. Being a control freak I always want the best seat in the house.

The soft guitar music playing provided some great ambiance. Lots of traditional decor including ceramics, paintings and carvings, it looked like you were in a little Mexican village. Our friendly waiter was dressed like a Mariachi!  Clever! I was ready to start requesting a song!

Immediately we were served this wonderful complimentary warm bean dip and salsa. The salsa tasted great with the perfect amount of spice and a bright beautiful red color.  A basket of crispy warm corn chips accompanied with just the right texture and thickness.  Nothing worse than a thin or thick chip.

I ordered off the A la Carte menu and chose the enchilada filled with shredded chicken and beef. The red chile sauce was very good.  The fluffy rice was cooked to perfection and beans were very tasty.

Service was speedy and we had friendly, all around great attentive service.  Plates start at about $10 and go up to $22 plus.  Lots of variety to choose from, overall a great place.

I can't wait to come back to try more dishes! Next time I'll try a churro for dessert and guess what Bobby Flay? Unlike Mesa Grill-they offer churros at lunch time! Bravo!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"I was not in the mood to make dinner and we were all craving something other than the usual so we decided to head into Outback Steakhouse. I've only been to Outback Steakhouse a handful of times and this was my first time at this place. 

The waiting area was crowded...and it was a weeknight?  Ugh!  Waiting around for a table on weeknight when you have kids in tow is not fun.

So while we waited...or rather so I can put up with the wait, my husband walked over to the bar to order a cocktail.  Luckily the bartender mixed up a fabulous ""House"" Margarita on the rocks. Then we waited...and waited...and waited...for our table. So when we saw the hostess looking for ""someone"" we finally asked, ""Did you call our name yet?""  And they said, ""Yes, just a minute ago.""...Well, guess what? Our pager was not working. I have to say the greeter at the door was very friendly and apologetic for the wait but I was a bit annoyed.

Our waitress seemed a bit tired and not overly enthusiastic to be there, but she was pleasant.  I'm sure it had been a long night.  I overheard another waitress apologize to her table for the food taking too long.  I thought, ""Oh no!  Not good!"" How am I going to continue to keep these kids busy?

So the nice thing is that there are kids activity menus and crayons..and our iphones to keep them from complaining (the cocktail was to keep me from complaining).  We ordered and it took a while for the drinks and bread to come out.  However, the food did not take too long.

Portions are a bit small-but very tasty.  Macaroni and cheese fabulous, steak cooked to perfection, pork medallions very yummy, new Asian salmon very good, grilled shrimp small but tasty and kids meals which included a grilled cheese for my picky eater all good and kids steak medallions.  Kids loved the complimentary warm mini loaf of bread.  The waitress was nice enough to offer more if we wanted...of course the Peanut Gallery in unison said, ""More please!""  We had a few kid leftovers but without the appetizer we had lots room to finish our meals.

I think for the value and taste it's not bad but the wait was just too long for a weeknight family outing, next time I'll just go to Chili's."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"If it's good enough for the Four Seasons it's good enough for me.

I'm so lucky to have this fabulous little gluten free bakery in my neighborhood.  

Specializing in artisan breads, pastries, cupcakes, rolls, cakes, sandwich breads and even cake pops  you will be sure to find something in here for everyone, and the best part is it doesn't ""taste like gluten-free"".

I love the French decor and ambiance complete with chandeliers. Reminds me of the bakery in my favorite movie ""It's Complicated""only on a much smaller scale.

I was greeted and helped right away.

I came in to buy some gluten free rolls for Thanksgiving dinner and thank goodness they had white rolls and an Italian roll (rosemary and thyme flavored). I purchased three bags and each bag had six rolls.

They had some chocolate cupcakes on display with pumpkin buttercream so I picked up a dozen cupcakes and a half a dozen lemon loaf muffins.  When you buy six muffins you get a 20 percent discount.  

As a bonus since I bought so many items I was given half a dozen cranberry orange muffins. Wow!  What a way to treat customers!

I was told what I didn't use to store in the freezer.  

I wish I had access to a store like this when my child was younger. At five months he had a wheat allergy, egg and peanut allergy so he was on a strict diet and all of the breads that I found at the specialty grocery stores tasted horrible. 

The breads here are moist, rich and with so much flavor.  No wonder the Four Seasons buys their gluten free items from this bakery!  It's the best!  However, the best does come at a price but it's very typical for gluten free items-and these items are baked fresh.

The only downer was the store hours, I've been here a few times only to find them closed.  Store hours are 10-5 p.m.everyday but Monday and Sunday. I wish they opened earlier.  You can order online too so if you live out of state this is an option. 

One teeny suggestion would be to have some samples of the breads available. 

The pastries varied from Opera cakes, cookies, brownies to Tiramasu and the only thing I wish they had were Macarons.  Those are gluten free...just saying.   

If you're looking for a gluten-free bakery look no more!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"Merci Beaucoup Patisserie Manon for the 15% Military discount! Next time you're driving down Charleston passed the Whole Foods you'll see a guy waving an arrow sign that says, ""French Bakery"" turn in and check it out and least for the Macaroons.  

I had been dying to try this place out and finally got a chance to on a Sunday afternoon.  They get 5-stars for quality and taste of the pastries but I had to only give them four for lack of friendly service and lack of signage once inside the bakery-which is ironic since they hired a guy just to get you in!  Maybe by the time you read this review, they will have made a few improvements.

You walk in you'll see one counter with pastries and cookies and some tables but  I wasn't sure if someone seats you, or if you can just sit wherever? 
 
Then towards the back, there's another counter (savory treats are here...sandwiches, soups, etc.) with another cash register, but you can't see the counter as you walk in. You have to walk all the way to the back while asking yourself, ""can I go back here""?  Where's the sign? Can I sit anywhere?  etc. so very confusing for the customer. People just cut in line too, so if you're trying to read the menu, they just get right in front of you so stand next to the counter so they can't get passed you, regulars have radar for rookies.

The array of pastries seemed limited but it was late in the day so I'm sure they had already sold many? Macaroons looked homemade-not like they were made at a factory and they were so delightful just a rainbow of colors. 

The cakes in the fridge are absolutely gorgeous!! I've never seen a cake like it before, decorated with gorgeous macaroons and strawberries, my hubby was nice enough to buy me one of these cakes for my birthday and -OMG DELICIOUS & BEAUTIFUL!  
http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=w3LLAst_f8jGPYwqOrXnog&userid=uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ

I picked up two macaroons and a Tiramasu and wow all fabulous.  Tiramasu was creamy, light, full of flavor and the macaroons were also full of flavor. The orange one tasted like a fruit loop.

Now that I know the lay of the land I may be back to try other items, but I will be back for more pastries and my military discount too."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"I can tell you the best thing about Zefferino's is the view!  The entrance is deceiving.  Just like the small restaurants in Rome there is a chalkboard with all the specials and a menu to peruse and bring you in.  A gorgeous dark cozy bar with a 40ft ceiling is in in plain view and a set of stairs will take you up to the top. I was almost tempted just to stop and have a Bellini at the lounge.

We were lucky to sit upstairs near an open window facing the Grand Canal inside the Venetian shops.  The decor is Old World with lots of oil paintings, furniture imported from Italy, tiles, chandeliers and stuccoed walls.  The fine China is adorned with its namesake so you won't forget where you're eating.

The hubby and I started out with a glass of Prossecco, which is the Italian version of Champagne-so you should order a glass from the Sommelier .  It was fruity, crisp, refreshing and romantic.  

The reason we chose to come here was they offered my favorite...Pasta Carbonara!  We had a very early dinner so the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  Service was polite but I think he was a bit annoyed that we didn't order an appetizer.  However, the pasta was not on the menu but he made it for me anyway.  I remember seeing it on the lunch special but it was dinner time...nonetheless I was graciously accommodated.

The menu is incredible with tons of options!  Foie Gras (which can also be ordered as  side dish), Filet, Lobster, Shrimp, pasta...and the dessert which is freshly made in the restaurant.  

My pasta was brought out and it was perfection!  The hubby ordered lasagna and he was very satisfied although he wished he would have ordered something less boring.

We skipped dessert but not to worry, the bakery out in the shops are the same desserts (the restaurant makes them), so if you don't have room, walk it off and have a coffee and Tiramisu later. 

Prices are comparable to decent restaurants on the strip. Appetizers start at $20 and up to $110 for a seafood platter.  The nice thing is the event space can accommodate at least s120 people for dinner, as an event planner, this is good news.

Overall,  a nice place to try at least once for a special occasion or for locals... for that much needed date night."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"The hubby took me here for my birthday and it was really special-since the Eiffel Tower, (the real one), has a lot of sentimental meaning to us.  He made reservations and had some red roses delivered to the table so they were there when we arrived.   Our table was next to the window with a perfect view of the Bellagio Fountains.  The restaurant was buzzing and there was a lounge in opposite corner so for those who just wanted a romantic view and some bubbly before dinner it was a perfect setting.  

I know its sounds crazy but we took our kids -although it's not a ""family"" style restaurant and I would not recommend taking kids here for dinner...we lucked out and kiddos cooperated with superb manners. I was very proud.  Having said that...it's definitely a romantic restaurant so if you can enjoy it sans kids do so, but I had no choice!  I had no sitter! No complaints from me I loved having them there to sing Happy Birthday.

The thing that struck me the most was that the restaurant was so accommodating and no one was looking at us like, 'seriously, you brought kids here?""  Even when my husband called for a reservation, they said they didn't have kids menu but that they could make them something.  Nonetheless, I was very lucky the puppets were well behaved that night.   They were really captivated by the fountains they each had their own window seat. I'm sure for lunch you'd see more families. 

I gave them five stars but our waiter gets three stars. He was so serious I felt like saying, ""Hello?  This is a celebration not a funeral-please smile.""   

A basket full of a variety of breads was brought around a few times and recommendations of some soft breads for the little ones were even recommended.  

Well, what can I say? Food was fab and I loved the surf and turf and foie gras and the bubbly.  Kiddos were accommodated with anything I ordered, thankfully I have a mini foodie who had fish broccoli and potatoes and my picky eater had some breaded chicken and frites.  They enjoyed the fountain, the elevator ride and we even took pictures in the kitchen which looked like something out of Ratatouille.  $500 later and a memorable evening...I will definitely be back to celebrate my next ""27th"" birthday!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"If you can't get to Nordstrom's cafe come here...WAIT...as a matter of fact, just skip the pricey, long drive to the Fashion Show eatery and COME HERE!

YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM...you get the picture.

Great speedy FRIENDLY service. Perfect place to grab a quick fresh bite to eat.  

Everything on the menu looked amazing...13 types of sandwiches, healthy berry and chicken types of salads, and ten soups to choose from:

CLAM CHOWDER
LOBSTER BISQUE
WISCONSIN CAULIFLOWER
GUMBO
TOMATO BASIL 
CHICKEN TORTILLA
CHICKEN ENCHILADA SOUP
TUSCAN WHITE BEAN
WILD MUSHROOM BISQUE
ROASTED RED PEPPER AND LOBSTER

I know, I know, I said the same thing...""which one should I get, they all sound so good""! Start with one and come back the next day...and the next day...and the next day...

A friendly greeter meets you at the door and since this was our first time eating here it was helpful to have some guidance.  She made some recommendations based on ""popular"" selections but we went our way.  My only complaint was that the dining room was freezing! It was warmer outside and it was 59 degrees that day! Turn the heat up during these chilly days please!

Honestly I'm not a fast-food soup person...I'm a total Soup-Snob. I've been to Sweet Tomatoes (bland) I've been to Panera (not impressed). I like my soup tasty hot and full of flavor. I prefer to have it at my favorite white linen tablecloth restaurant cafe or bistro. But, I have to say... I was pleasantly surprised with our order.

Trying to choose a combination lunch here was like trying to choose between chocolate covered strawberry's or creme brûlée...hmmm tough decision.  Oh, and by the way, both are served here for dessert.  And the strawberries come with the combo meal.  Yipee!  I told you this place was awesome.

We had a lunch combo which lets you order soup or sandwich or soup and salad.  I had the roasted red pepper lobster bisque with the mango berry salad- and the hubby ordered the cream of mushroom with fried onions and a avocado turkey bacon panini...oh my goodness, can you say a contender for my last meal on earth? Soup was hot spicy and fabulous.  Sandwich was warm, crispy and tasty. We shared every bite and I suggest you bring a few friends and do the same. 

This is the only Cafe Zuppas in town and the other is in Henderson.
  
Well, what are you waiting for?  Go Now!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"I really am a creature of habit. If I go to a buffet on the strip I always go to the W/ynn and I am NEVER disappointed.  The long lines are what usually deter me and tonight I would have waited for two days to eat at the Wynn rather than waiting to eat at The Buffet at Bellagio.  

I had read mixed reviews from my Yelp friends and since we had some out of town guests we decided to try something different. 

What a mistake. 

The only positive was the short wait in line on a Saturday night it was only 15 minutes. 

The rest of the night pretty much goes downhill from there. 

No stand out service except for a chef at one of the stations who offered us an entree without the sauce.  

Standard generic offerings-nothing creative  

Here's what I saw:  crab legs, prime rib (but I can make a prime rib at home-so not too impressed), mussels, shrimp (no cups for a side offering of the cocktail sauce), salmon, 

Chicken, turkey, beef, pasta, mashed potatoes, 

Asparagus, ravioli, pizza, macaroni and cheese, 

Taco station/fajita station, sushi, chinese, salads, 

Fruits (but the strawberry's were all gone), 

Desserts were average: Soft serve ice-cream, cheesecake, carrot cake, macarons, nothing nut free-in fact it was the opposite and a sign states that nuts could be in desserts so my youngest could not have anything but ice cream. 

Anyway, Boring, Boring, Boring

I will add that the food was tasty and it gets 4 stars, but my rating goes down due to the lack of cleanliness and creative dishes.

All of the stations were so messy and sloppy and dry crusted on juices everywhere.  

I was really grossed out. 

No one was keeping house or had been for most of the night.

My husband said the men's restroom was dirty and disgusting. 

The seating area where we ate was was wet and food was on it we had to call someone over to clean it. 

The thought of touching every single spoon that a million other people touchedt at the buffet grossed me out.  I can appreciate the individual servings that are offered at Bacchanal, and my goodness Bacchanal's rating will go up after seeing the cluster here.

Just a note: If you go to any buffet carry antiseptic to clean your hands after handling the spoons that hundreds have touched. 

The local Station casino's were much cleaner and presentations much better than what I saw here.  

What a waste of money.  

We will not be back."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"When I hug my kids I always tell them I don't need to go to heaven because heaven is already here.  And people that is just what I said when I took one bite of the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill.  Wow-Fireworks!  

The chile was stuffed with roasted eggplant and Manchego cheese, sweet red pepper sauce and lightly dusted with cornmeal not a greasy egg battered mess-just delicousness.

Then I said, ""Why didn't I order that?"" It was my sister's order. Boo-hoo. Sadly that's where the fireworks ended.  

I ordered the boring salmon for $22 and I want my money back. The menu said it had ancho chile and honey glaze and roasted jalapeno crema...doesn't that sound appetizing?  Haa haa nothing exciting. I did not taste any of those flavors! They must have sent me the senior citizen entree... just healthy and forgettable which by the way you need to specify that you want it well done otherwise they prepare it rather raw-and it was still undercooked for me. If you've had a Lean Cuisine this reminded me of one of those frozen ""healthy"" meals. Skip it!

My Margarita was okay and the starter which was the Tiger Shrimp Tamale--was good but honestly too bland and boring.  I want my $16 back. The boiled-like shrimp, sauce and cornmeal was more like baby food. How could this be a signature dish?  Please grill those shrimp till their black and add some green chile and spice.  Personally, I like my tamales like I like my men...HOT!  (actually just one man...the hubby LOL). Disappointed in this raved about dish.

The stars of the show were the Lemon Drop Martini which our fabulous waiter suggested, the free bread basket which was amazing.  Yum yum went my tum tum, a nice variety of cornbread and sweet bread. And of course my sister's chile relleno.  Glad she got the good order since it was her birthday.  

Another downer?  No churro dessert offered at lunch time!  Boo-Bobby-Boo!

Our waiter was super friendly, funny and very engaging. Five stars for the service.

Restaurant is located inside Ceasar's Palace. We were seated right away and the restaurant is beautiful and contemporary with views of the casino and the entrance to the Pure Nightclub.

Drinks cost as much as the food so our lunch with tip was about $100.  I will be back and hopefully have the winning entree (Chili Relleno). 

Pricey lunch for the average tasting meal that I ordered, but I'm willing to come back since my sister's dish was out of this world! 

Lunch is M-F from 11-2:30 p.m."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"The Bellagio is always a must-stop when I have guests in town who are dying to go see the sights.  You can valet either at the front lobby or off of Flamingo near the shops but if you're walking you'll be sure to enjoy one of Las Vegas' main attractions...the fountains! Gorgeous at night spectacular during the day-its a free show to see and enjoy before you even walk in the door.

Bellagio is one of my favorite hotel/casinos on the strip. It's so beautiful inside but my goodness it's always crowded.  

You'll be greeted by a spectacular hand-blown glass chandelier. A sculpted massive arrangement of flowers adorn the ceiling and you'll see camera's flashing before your eyes since everyone will be ""blown"" away by its beauty.

A fabulous little lobby bar where you can rest your tired feet is always a favorite. I remember having cocktails there with my in-laws but since ""dad"" is no longer with us, every time I pass by I remember the time we enjoyed some great martinis!

When he was here we also went to see the amazing popular ""O"".  A water-trapeze spectacle show which is shown year-round.

For my anniversary I had dinner at Olives-where the food is amazing but the hostess who didn't sit us outside on our special day gets a big BOO! 

The nightclub I've heard is wonderful but years ago we enjoyed drinks and live music there with a great balcony water view.  Not sure if you have that option now, but on that occasion when you just want a nice view and a drink -this was the place to go.

The buffet can be hit or miss but for me it was a miss.  It's not my favorite on the strip but for some it could be enjoyable.

The main restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner was also a fail-sadly the food and service was not that great.

I've visited the museum which hosts various art exhibitions including exceptional historic artists, so if you're in town check out the Fine Art Museum so you don't miss your favorite collection.

The casino is beautiful and full of action, I don't play the tables much so me and my guests usually have fun at the slots but always walk away winners.

Shopping shouldn't be missed even if you're just ""Looky-Looing"".  Pop in the Chanel store and buy yourself at least a little bottle of perfume, you'll at least smell like a high-roller.

The conservatory shouldn't be missed. Every season they change it up and you'll find huge fun displays made of flowers!

The spa, the rooms and some high-end restaurants are still on my list to try so I will definitely be back."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"Came here last night with our wonderful friends Jesse and Don for a couples night out. I decided to try this place based on location, atmosphere, food and reviews about the service from the Yelpers.  It did not disappoint. 

When you enter the restaurant, you come into the ""wine shop"" where you first select your wine/beer of choice.  From the moment we walked in we were helped with wine selection. I heard about the Poison Red Zin and chose it for dinner.  It was very light and satisfying. I also chose a Prosecco and the guys chose the ""Rolls Royce of Beers"" (as the waiter called it) think its spelled ""Chimay"".  

We chose to sit out on the patio but it was covered with the plastic so that was a bummer. We did have a space heater and the waiter was courteous to adjust the heat accordingly.  

They sat us in a corner and my view was of a door and some candles-which was the only reason I didn't give this a 5-star rating-because when I called for the reservation I asked for a ""really good table"".  If this is the hostess' definition of a good table...then she needs to be re-trained.   The tables in front of the fireplace would have fit the bill. Inside was really nice too, but it felt more casual outside and less stuffy-so we were fine with that. 

Live music-female singer-wonderful really provided some nice ambiance. She sang Adele, Nora Jones, etc.  So 5-star for the entertainment.

Food was very good, I can't say I was full-since I didn't order side dishes but we ordered mussels and the shrimp with grits (creole) and very tasty.  Keep in mind this is a French restaurant so portions were small and you have to order Al a Carte for veggies/ mashed potatoes, etc. 

I ordered the duck-very good, my husband had the shrimp which he said was fabulous, the trout was also served as well as the lobster ravioli-everyone raved about their dishes.  They also bring out a little bread and butter basket and the baguettes were marvelous. You need to order side dishes to feel satisfied.

I think what impressed all of us the most was the service!  That is definitely a five star rating!!!  Waiters were friendly, accommodating, gracious, polite, professional, I could go on and on. We were pretty loud-laughing the whole night and we felt like we had the whole restaurant to ourselves-it was a fabulous fun night.  

We had reservations at 5:45 and stayed until 10 pm so you never felt rushed to leave.

This place was pricey and the portions are just too small to justify the price. Maybe I'll try lunch next time."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"Merci Boucoup Village Buffet for the Veterans Day free meal for active duty members! 

This French cuisine themed buffet is located inside the Paris casino. On this visit our wait in line was only a short 10 minutes!!! Wow we got lucky! So come early.

I've been here several times over the years and have enjoyed it. It's quaint and not over the top big with miles of walking while you have a plate in your hand. So don't compare it to Cesar's, Wynn or Cosmopolitan buffets or you'll be greatly disappointed. There's enough food just not an amazing array of stand out choices. It's French inspired unlike other buffets on the strip which offer massive international cuisine options. So just keep that in mind.

Dinner was $69 for two. But call for current pricing. At the time I wrote this review Paris players card holders get $3 off the buffet.

The food here is good, although a few dishes were meh. Not all the food was French. I saw some Mediterranean flavors (Gyro etc) and sushi rolls. I saw a grill where they were cooking chicken and other meats. So Paleo dieters rejoice.

Hopefully you will sit in the open dining room area with the open French Market atmosphere, if you get stuck in the back room like we did it loses the allure as these rooms are small and they block all the fun views. You'd think it would be quiet but we were stuck in there with screaming babies.

Here are some of the traditional French dishes that I saw and some I tried:

Duck a la Orange (yummy), 
Roast beef
Crab Legs (they were always out)
Shrimp (on the shell)
Chicken Coq au Vin (good), 
Seafood Bouillabaisse, 
Scalloped potatoes (which were not great), 
Whipped potatoes (not as good as the Wynn), 
Pasta in truffle butter (fabulous), 
Macaroni and Cheese (nope not great), 
Green Beans Almondine, 
Asparagus (wonderful), 
Salmon (heavenly), 
Poached Halibut, 
Sweet and Savory made-to-order crepes (filling and great), 
French cheeses and bread, 
French onion soup (salty), potato leek soup (wonderful), tomato soup (skip it) and a Small dessert station with mostly all empty trays:(  

Sadly on this visit it was like a football team came before I did.  They were out of crab legs every time I went up to check!  By the time the crab showed up I was already on dessert! So go get crab legs first! And they're served cold.

Overall, we had great attentive service and since my sister's are fans (and they always pay for dinner) ...I'll probably be back. This is one of the original ""big"" buffets and breakfast is served here too! I'll be back."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"I've died and gone to Mexican Heaven!  Mazapan? Ganzitos? Limones? Agua Fresca? Pan Dulce? Tortilleria? Carneceria? Aqui lo tienen!  All I can say is when I was in the housewares aisle and I found a ice shaver to make raspados, I was like, that's it, I can't believe it!   This place was one piñata short of a fiesta.  All things Mexican and I love it, love it love it!  I can't believe it took me this long to get here.  

I love to cook and entertain so I can't wait to come back to the carneceria to buy some drummettes, flank steak, shrimp, carnitas, tripe, etc.  And to actually have some fresh tortillas?

People this is a throw back!  I spent many summers in Mexico and every day we would walk to the tortilleria for two kilos of corn tortillas freshly made, so the tortillas will be in my basket on the next shopping run. 

The only negative: I could have done without the wandering hobo in the store, but that made it even more authentic.  

So I picked up some pan dulce-awesome array of traditional pastries.  The deli had lots of Mexican food items on the menu and many tables to sit at, the Aguas Frescas were out-so couldn't sample but if you're going to throw a Cinco de Mayo party-go here!  

They have clay pottery for beans and salsa, hand juice extractors (everyday in Mexico we would make our own limeade from key limes, so I had to get me some limones and a juice extractor to replicate some key limeade!)  

All my favorite kid snacks were here too. It was like walking down memory lane! I use to walk to the corner ""tiendita"" back in La Colonia in Mexico to get some Ganzitos (chocolate mini cake filled with frosting and jelly. We'd put them in the freezer to last longer and you can enjoy them right out of the freezer too).  Then I had to get my all time favorite Mazapan candy too (made out of ground peanuts). 

Oh, and I can't forget the MAIN reason I came here was to find this wonderful seasoning called TAJIN,  sprinkle on mangos add lime juice or sliced up Jicama, or street corn with mayo and queso fresco, or marinate your shrimp, etc.. It's main spice is chili powder but it's not spicy. You can find it in the produce aisle.  Go buy some!

Staff is friendly and helpful, store was clean, well stocked and organized. And yes, I bought the ice-shaver so now I can't wait to buy a block of ice and make the kids their own snow cones like I had when I was a kid.  It's all nostalgic and about creating memories right? Marianna's will definitely help me do that!   Great prices too, but they don't take PESOS!  People, I'll be back!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"Thank you Shark Reef Aquarium for the Military Discount!

I finally got a chance to visit the Shark Reef Aquarium at Mandalay Bay. What a great afternoon, it was awesome!  I love to travel and every time I'm in a new city I always visit the aquarium if they have one.  

It was difficult to find when I drove into the parking lot. Proper signage was not posted and it seems like you're driving into a loading dock.  Look for a small white rotunda and enter through there and then you have to walk a bit. Another option, go through the hotel if  you're already a guest, or you valet/park at the hotel. Regardless, proper walking shoes are recommended.

The line to buy tickets can get a bit long, but once inside they take a souvenir photo of you and your group so you can choose to buy it at the end, which we did. 

The first part of the exhibit takes you to see the reptiles and a humid jungle-like environment that has crocs, lizards, and fish that swim in the Amazon.  A touch-pool gets you up close to see starfish and stingrays which is all included in the price.

I love seeing the sharks up close and they have these awesome viewing windows on the floor which is a bit creepy. You'll see lots of sharks swimming all around you, at least 15 species including sea turtles. The Hammerheads were so cool to see up close.  If you're a shark fan like me then you've found Nirvana.

The Jellyfish and Octopus exhibit was also on display as was the ray feeding exhibit which the kids enjoyed. 

A huge tunnel lets you see more sharks swimming by and offers a great selfie-op so click away. You'll feel like your underwater.  

This exhibit doesn't take long to get through so you'll have plenty of time to see more of Vegas!

Don't come expecting a coastal aquarium (like Long Beach, San Fran, Monterey, Baltimore, Sea World, which takes you hours to get through) no comparison. But if you like aquariums, have kids then you won't be disappointed. 

Local/Military discount available $15 adults, $10 kids and under 5 free. These are great prices, I'm not sure what people are expecting to pay for an exhibit that's so costly to maintain, this is a reasonable price. 

The much anticipated Yearly Pass will only cost you around $40 a year with unlimited visits and a 10 percent discount at the shop.  $25 for kids and those under 5 yrs old FREE. 

I wish they had some nice places to sit and eat afterwards. They had a food court next door but on the day we went most places were closed.   

A nice souvenir shop will keep you busy browsing afterwards so bring some cash to buy a coffee mug.

I'll be back! Don't miss:)"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"Thank you for the Military discount!  This exhibit can be found inside the Luxor Hotel and Casino.

A tribute and memory to so many perished on Titanic.  Very touching and moving exhibit that takes you back to that frightful night.  In 2008 this exhibit was at the Arizona Science Museum where I was lucky enough to see it.  This exhibit is very similar and the second time around was even better.

I can't even begin to imagine how so many people suffered such a tragedy.  So many artifacts from the ship to see including an actual piece of the ship.

I really enjoyed the glass cases that kept the actual artifacts that were found. I think the one I remember the most was a box full of viles of perfume that one passenger was taking to America as samples.  Vents on the casing allows you to smell inside the case and surprisingly you can still smell the fragrance.

Your ticket is a ""boarding pass"" that has the actual name of a passenger and what class of service they were in.  At the end of the tour a list of the passengers that perished and survived is posted along with photographs.  This makes it all too real and very moving. The lighting in the entire exhibit is perfection.

Really nice and well done. I appreciated the ""crew"" member who was on hand walking around to answer any of your questions.  My son begged me to take him to this exhibit which had just visited a few weeks ago, but wanted to see it again.  He asked so many questions about the ship so I was happy to take him and the crew member was very sweet and polite and answered all of our questions.

I did learn that the voyage of the Titanic was scheduled for five days from the U.K. to the U.S. and it was on the 4th day that it crashed into the ice-burg.  The trip actually took six days back then but they wanted to prove that Titanic would beat that time frame.  They also veered off course and this took them into Northern chillier waters.  

An ice-burg is also on display to touch which is a great interactive feature. Another favorite part was walking into the outdoor night time deck area.  It gave you the feeling of being out on the deck and imagining how dark and cold it was on that night. Stars included!

The whole exhibit is fascinating and you'll also see replicas of the first and third class cabins and of course you'll see the famous staircase.  Remember the 3rd class floor where Leonardo and Kate are running from the gushing waters?  It's here too.

A nice gift shop provides some souvenir shopping including the chance to buy replicas of the china and that glittery blue heart diamond necklace.

So much to talk about, but I'd rather you go and see it for yourself!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"I fell in love here,  I've been a guest here, I've worked here, I met Gregory HInes here, I even served Walter Cronkite a drink here!

Walking into the Phoenician is like walking back in time for me.  Having worked here when the doors first opened until it was dubbed Club Fed, I've seen the Phoenician evolve from a family-owned business to a corporate-owned resort which at that point lost its luster.

Originally you could find fine art hanging on the walls, European decor and the fine bone china used for afternoon tea was the same pattern Princess Diana had in her collection. 

When you walk in the lobby from the valet, stop in front of the fountain where the star-shaped pattern is on the marble lobby floor.  You'll see a gold circle in the middle, that used to be engraved with Mary Elaine's signature. (C.Keating's wife original owner). Just some trivia.

Have a cocktail at the Thirsty Camel and sit outside on the balcony.  In the evenings they have a piano player so you can listen to live music while you take in the panoramic views of the city.  They have fire pits outside and plenty of seating. 

If you walk down the stairs off the lobby you'll see a wooden door with a stained glass window.  That's a private room called the Praying Monk, its a wine cellar that's used for private parties-less than 20 people, it's really cool so check it out on the way to the pool.

If you can stay for lunch go to the Terrace and sit on the patio. Order the Prickly Pear Ice-Tea.
 
I also recommend Afternoon Tea served in the lobby. I've had high tea several times here and it's on my top ten list. Chicken salad tea sandwiches are the best.  (My top place for high tea?  The Peninsula in Hong Kong).

Rooms are luxurious, so if you stay, enjoy all the resort has to offer.  The spa is fabulous.  I've had some treatments here and it's all first class. Schedule some time with a golf pro too, I was lucky I knew one of the pro's and got some lessons myself. If you're up early you can see Coyotes run across the grounds which are cool.

During the time I was there, Alessandro Stratta was chef at the French restaurant. It was a fabulous experience-it's now a steak house so I can only say that the location of the restaurant is on the top level so at night views are amazing.  

Guests in the Presidential Suite ranged from Michael Jackson, Stevie Nicks and Bon Jovi to a Saudi Prince who one night requested Maine Lobster to be flown in from...wait for it...you guessed it! Maine.

Having worked in a 5-Star first class hotel, you learn very quickly what true 5-star standards are, so when you travel you're pretty good at deciphering what meets true hospitality standards and the Phoenician still has it all!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"Pupusas in Summerlin! Having  been to San Salvador I was eager to try this place out and People, I was not disappointed!  Las Pupusas Restaurant, a family-owned business, just opened their 5th location and what a delight to have a super clean, and super friendly Pupusas Restaurant in the neighborhood!  And wow, this place is huge! I'm telling you, this is the real deal. I was really surprised at how big the Pupusas were, they were the size of a tostada so one is very filling!  All the flavors I remember from my trip were all there too.  

If you've never had a Pupusa don't compare the flavors to its near-neighboring country of Mexico-you won't find super spicy flavors in a Pupusa or the ""salsa"" it comes with which is not really a salsa as you know it, its actually a tangy mildly spicy salad dressing to pour over the Curtido. Pupusas are filled with a variety of savory fillings. The further south you go on the continent the less spicy the food gets, Quinoa in Peru and by the time you get to Argentina, its meat and potatoes! 

Starting at just $1.75 you can choose from a variety of Pupusas, from: Guqimi, Herb, Mixed, Bean and Cheese, to Loro, Calabaza (squash), and Chicken.  We had the chicken, herb and cheese, Revuelto (mixed), and the beans and cheese, all made to order and piping hot even when I got home!  They are made to order so they take at least 20 minutes (go to Jack in the Box if you want your order in two minutes). Our Pupusas were served with a GENEROUS side of  traditional ""salsa"" dressing and Curtido (sliced cabbage, carrot, spices, vinegar) which like any ""cole slaw"" it's just a matter of who makes it best, and they make it real good!  The only thing missing from my experience was a muggy, outdoor Central-American tropical patio, and a Suprema beer (San Salvadorian beer which by the way no one in Vegas carries!) 

This restaurant serves a Mexican menu as well, (tacos, chilaquiles, caldos, seafood platters, tortas, burritos, fajitas) and breakfast! So next time, I'll be ordering some huevos con chorizo for desayuno. Menu of course features a variety of typical Salvadorean dishes like Yuca con Chicharron (yucca root with cooked pork rinds), Platanos de Chiplin and a few imported beers available too.

Lots of folks ordering take-out for a Saturday night, like me, but I'm looking forward to sitting down and trying more entrees.  Menu is vast and lots of delish options to choose from. Since they have sister locations sprinkled all over town, most folks will appreciate the same menu and hopefully get the same quality and consistency. Love this place, so delicious! This will be my weekly stop! I'm so happy they opened a restaurant in Summerlin yippee!  Get in your car and go now! Opened 9-9 p.m. 7 days a week."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"Ruined Anniversary

In a nutshell, If Cheesecake Factory had an gorgeous older sister her name would be Olives. The exceptional food was the saving grace. But don't choose this place for a special occasion and reservations aren't taken for the patio. And the hostess didn't even have our reservation so we had a terrible table!

 5-stars for food. 2-stars for the crowded, dark, indoor seating area and 2 stars for not going out of their way to make it a 5-star night on my 10-Year Anniversary! 

I don't know why I bothered dressing up, people on this night were VERY casual and I was in my nice dress and high heels, I felt a bit overdressed...

Pasta dishes start at $26 and go up to $41 for Lobster Carbonara.  Then by the time you order a $10 cocktail and pricey bottled water, your bill for two people will be easily in the $200 range. That doesn't include dessert or salad.  

Service was a 4-star. It was a speedy dinner, they turned over these tables quickly. So if you're looking for a lingering affair, this isn't your place. 

The waiter was helpful but dinner ended in like an hour.  Most of my dinner was spent looking at the waiter's station even though I was seated in front of a window (but not next to it). 

It was hard seeing new patrons being taken to sit on the patio while I was inside ""celebrating"" a special occasion. Sour grapes?  Yep! I spent my night staring at two old ladies who were at least next to the window. Then we sat next to a busy aisle so waiters were walking by every second. It was like two clowns short of a circus.  

Don't come here for a special night, too risky and too expensive to pay for indoor seating. 

We ordered the escargot and it came out really fast-almost too fast.  It wasn't warm enough but had all the flavors you would expect (garlic) to create the perfect dragon breath that you'll have after eating it. 

For my entree I ordered the Seabass and it was absolutely amazing.  I'm a huge fan of the Butterfish entree at Roy's (one of my favorite all-time fish entrees with the same consistency) and this entree exceeded above and beyond.  It was served with a mushroom risotto and some spinach and the sauces...wow every bite was truly magical I really, really, loved it.  

My husband had a steak with some lobster croquettes and also tasted fabulous and well prepared.  

He ordered some crazy blueberry martini that the waiter recommended, but to me it tasted like a bar of soap. 

I had a glass of Pink Moscato and wished I had ordered the whole bottle just to get me through dinner for choosing this place on such a special occasion.  

The waiter brought out a nice dish that said HAPPY ANNIVERSARY written in chocolate on a plate with some truffles and it was very nice.  

Overall, never coming back."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"Christmas prefix menu!  Remington's has been a signature Paradise Valley restaurant that I have driven by for many years.  We were guests at the adjacent hotel over Christmas and this made it convenient. Thankfully they offered a great menu to satisfy everyone in our party. 

Reservations were accepted for immediate seating and the hostess was very friendly.  We started out in the lounge with a cocktail and listened to the piano player while we enjoyed our Bailey's on the rocks. Christmas trees were lit up with twinkling lights so it was a beautiful festive atmosphere. I have to say the one thing I noticed was the ""mature"" crowd, so it's a perfect place to bring grandma, at least on this night.  A roaring fireplace offered a perfect backdrop. 

In the dining room we sat next to the fireplace but it had been turned off (I guess it got a little too warm-but would have been a nice touch if it was on) My sister forgot her reading glasses and after mentioning it to the manager jokingly, he immediately brought a pair of ""cheaters"" over for us to use.  What service!  I have to say I do miss that Arizona hospitality.  

The menu offered all of my favorite dishes so picking an entree was not easy.  For starters they offered the butternut squash soup or a Cesar salad or a harvest salad with roasted butternut squash and cranberries.  I know they all sound delicious.  I chose the Harvest salad. Fabulous and not filling just what I wanted. A bread basket was not left out and the kids always enjoy this-especially my picky eater. Next was another choice of yumminess.  Filet mignon or salmon or seafood Risotto?  There were more options but these my top three that kept me thinking...hmmm they all sound good. 

In the end I chose the risotto and my sister chose the filet which meant I would get to sample hers.  The risotto was very good but the filet was a mouthwatering explosion of savory moist juicy wonderfulness.  I really enjoyed the filet-and the shrimp in my risotto was a perfect compliment.  Since we had the kids with us, they did offer a mini pre-fix meal that included a choice of salad and entree that had turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce.  Dessert was also included and we all ordered the cheesecake.  It was okay-nothing outstanding it had some nuts and sauce and I don't think it was a good compliment.

Overall for the price $58 pp $25 for kids (which only one child ate) was a good value. Remington's offered a wonderful meal with attentive service and beautiful Southwestern decor.  

I don't think I would have ever chosen this restaurant especially with children. Thankfully we were not the only family there and despite the upscale ambiance we were not looked at cross-eyed when we brought in our kids.  There is a patio so I'm sure during warmer evenings this would be a nice dining alternative."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"Oh my goodness, Oh my goodness, Oh my goodness!  That's what I said all night long...at dinner... at one of my new favorite buffets on the strip. 

Located on the second floor inside the most fabulous trendiest hotel on the strip, The Cosmopolitan,  you'll be in a chic ready-to-party mood the second you walk in.  

We valet parked and a very friendly bellman welcomed Kate and I to the hotel. We sauntered in pass the changing laminated columns in the hotel lobby passing the Vesper bar which was sprinkled with a classy, hip styling crowd and the music was on.  Right next to it you will find the escalators that will take you to Food Heaven a.k.a. The Wicked Spoon. 

House Cabrenet wine for only $20-nice reasonable option which we got!

A bottle of water is always on the table. 

Service very attentive (unlike Bacchanal where our plates piled up and drinks took forever).

Lots of fabulous side dishes that we tried/shared mostly served ""tapas"" style which I prefer because it allows you to taste more and waste less:  

Asian beef and vegetables lemongrass flavor this was tasty
Lobster risotto was heavenly-my favorite!!!
Polenta and roast beef-oh...yummy yummy
Duck ravioli fabulous another favorite!!
Truffle potatoes, hmm okay
Salmon-sadly fishy
Whipped potatoes, okay
Mini prime rib panini's were amazing another favorite!!
Sushi which was okay
Creamed spinach-mmmm
Fried oysters-good
Lemon grass flavored stir fried rice was fluffy and fabulous.
Gnocchi with ricotta sounded good was just okay
Shrimp cocktail-two tiny shrimp in a shot glass with sauce and a slice of lemon
Cheese plate and parmesan crisps-perfect compliment to my wine

The Asian section had servings in tiny to-go chinese boxes-that was clever. 

Another station was the made to order mac n cheese, (literally a bar with toppings to choose from) I didn't stand in line for this one.

Seafood was crab legs and some ceviche, side dishes of BBQ shrimp and grits, and other side type of seafood dishes-but no stand outs for me.

For meat eaters they served prime rib, several styles of chicken, ribs, fried chicken served in tiny frying baskets and bone marrow. 

Desserts were full of flavor. Here are some that jumped on my plate:

Chocolate Molten cake -served warm-good not fabulous but good
Chocolate covered strawberries also dipped in oreo crumbs-mmm loved this
Tiramisu-yes more more!
Bon Bons gold dusted and on a stick-yes give me some mo!
Opera cake-very good
Pumpkin cheese cake-okay
Pumpkin flan-yummy

I missed out on the gold leaf Macarons:(  boo hoo hoo!  Well I guess I will just have to go back!  Maybe we started dinner too late?  7:30? My advice come early!

$84 for two people not including wine. They didn't play any music like Bacchanal, no crepe stations, no Mexican food or Ramen station and the food options were not as grand as Bacchanal but the consistency and presentation of the gourmet dishes, the service and ambiance were all very good and worth a second trip-plus NO two-hour wait in a buffet line!

This is my new favorite buffet right up there with Bacchanal and the Wynn!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"Since we were engaged in Paris overlooking the Eiffel Tower it would only be fitting that we celebrate our wedding anniversary in the Eiffel Tower...and since we're not in Paris...this would offer everything we wanted...romance, incredible views, bubbly champagne, fabulous service and a French menu.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eiffel-tower-restaurant-las-vegas?select=-_1Xz5jqO2AvQ5T3gFGnYA#4hxDvdGIpchARJW5rmp44w

Reservations were made easy on Open Table and we were seated without waiting despite our early arrival.  I really enjoy the ride up the elevator and the friendly VIP greeting prior to getting in the elevator and while exiting into a busy buzzing kitchen with chefs running around in white aprons and hats.

We arrived prior to sunset and we were seated against the window on a half moon table with views of the strip and the Bellagio Fountains.  Our waitress was super friendly, warm and hospitable.  

Our drink orders were taken right away. We were offered some recommendations and a menu featuring specialty cocktails was a big help.  I ordered a Lemon Drop Martini which was very good and my husband ordered the Eiffel Tower with infused berry's-which he ordered so I could try and it was a bit tart for me.  The drink almost looks like you could pour it over a bowl of vanilla ice-cream, it was heavy syrupy consistency but it packed a punch.  
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eiffel-tower-restaurant-las-vegas?filter_by_userid=True&select=Y5k8bMJLW1S8xBf8L3vxSA&userid=uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ#C0vYkF1CZXXOs_OOEtXE7A

We opted for the tasting menu at $125 pp which takes you into about a three-hour experience.  Wine pairings for an additional $79 pp was also an option. The highlights were the scallops-texture flavor mmm cooked to perfection. Foie Gras was very good but needed a bit more sweetness on the plate, the venison was my least favorite-although it was cooked very well the clove or anise spices were too intense which since it's already gamey it was overpowering despite its purpose to enhance.  The starter was a wonderful little shot of cold onion soup-it was creamy and delicious. Dessert was a wonderful delicious chocolate soufflé and a plate of sorbet's. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eiffel-tower-restaurant-las-vegas?filter_by_userid=True&select=Y5k8bMJLW1S8xBf8L3vxSA&userid=uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ#-_1Xz5jqO2AvQ5T3gFGnYA

We were debating where to have dinner. Since last year we were at the Bellagio and had a terrible experience I wasn't excited to go back to try one of their restaurants. The Wynn was also a contender but Eiffel Tower won us over simply due to nostalgia and the views.

The last time we were here we had a party of four with us and had a bigger table which offered more elbow room.  I wasn't a big fan of the smaller tables and some of the customers weren't dressed to impress which is always off-putting because the restaurant is plush red velvet and elegant.  I think the price per person was a bit steep for the value.  Overall the service was fabulous.  I do plan on coming back maybe just next time for dessert at the lounge."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"If Agave had an ugly sister her name would be Dos Caminos.

I had a hard time rating between a two and three star experience. But with so many downers the three star rating seemed fair for a first time experience. 

I'll start with the good news: The mole enchiladas, the kids meal sliders and the corn bread skillet were 5 stars!  

Okay, now for the bad news: 

Having been a fan of the old pink decor that Agave had, I wasn't a fan of the brown dark interior.  The music and vibe felt more like a nightclub and the restaurant was really loud and no ""Mexican"" music was playing which tells me...not your ""typical"" Mexican food restaurant.

We waited 15-20 minutes for a table and we sat near the kitchen which loses its charm if you're not outside or in the ""kiva"" near the bar.  

Waitress seemed overwhelmed so she was more like an order taker than a friendly waitress.  No smile, no ""Welcome to DC is this your first time here?  Let me recommend... "".  Instead it was ""what can I get you to drink and are you having the guacamole?""  No I didn't order the guac.

Personally, with so many restaurants in Vegas they should be going out of their way to welcome customers and make recommendations off the menu.

Kids menu offered mini sliders, quesadillas and tacos so I thought the menu was a bit limited.  They do bring out bendos and crayons and a menu to color on so that is always a plus with me.

Food took FOREVER to come out it was at least 45 minutes! But at least it was semi-worth it.  Definately made to order meals, not a premaid frozen or slapped together mess, just fresh delicious upscale presentations.  

I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas and they were good, I don't think I would order them again though. They were very spicy served New Mexico style-flat with layers of sauce, spinach and cheese, but needed more sour cream.  

My sister ordered the mole enchiladas and wow!  Those were winners!  Her dish looked amazing with zigzag crema and nicely sliced julienne radishes.  

Kids ordered sliders and they were yummy...I know because I took one bite then I had to have another!  My other sister ordered a hamburger, which she liked and that woman is hard to please.

Menu is a bit different than your typical Mexican restaurant, lots of hamburgers to choose from...? 

Waitress did us no favors by explaining the slant on the menu or restaurant not that we would be able to hear her anyway since it was so loud.

Chips and three salsa's came out.  Nothing fabulous about the salsa just mild, medium and HOT, taste was okay but too watery.

The winner was definitely corn bread skillet!  OMG they should be adding this to the appetizers menu, or offering it as a sample or a side because this was delicious! Moist warm tasty a bit creamy with a little bit of spice and perfect to share.  It's hidden on the ""sides"" section of the menu. Order this for sure!

Overall, I wouldn't come running back. Maybe I was there on an off night?

UPDATE:  I did hear back from the restaurant so I always appreciate feedback! All very positive..so for that maybe I'll stop in for a Margarita and give Dos Caminos one more chance."
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"If God came down and said, ""Time to go! Where do you want to eat?""  TAO! 

Wow!  I'll be back, again and again and again and again!

It was the hubby's birthday so we celebrated.  The highlight was that Bono (U2) and Lebron James were here!  We didn't get to see any of these mega stars but I did see Lebron's birthday cake as it was being brought in, complete with basketball and crown!

I made these reservations weeks in advance and confirmed them several times. The restaurant is so intimidating which should be the opposite since it has such a Zen feeling as you walk in with the tubs at the entrance filled with orchids and candles.  The most surprising thing was seeing families for the early dinners.  I really thought this place was a couples romantic dinner place.  They also have a sushi bar.  We got there a little before 7 p.m. and someone had a baby and another family had some teenagers. It was a nice mixed crowd.

The very dark lounge is where we started and we were in the mood for Mai Tai's. Waitress took her time getting to us so we walked up to the bar.  We are big on birthdays.  Last year we went to Hawaii so the Mai Tai's seemed fitting since we stayed state side.  They were fabulous!  So if your a Mai Tai drinker, have one here. You get a nice slice of fresh pineapple too.

We got a booth and I have to say that I wasn't too happy since it wasn't facing the giant buddha.  But after our gorgeous waiter appeared, I mean our friendly waiter appeared all was forgotten (or was it the Saki bombers that did it?)

Every recommendation he made we took.  It was our first time here so we were happy to be guided through the menu.  

We shared everything so we started with the Lobster Potstickers, it was served in a hot pot with mushrooms and this incredible sauce OMG it was so mild yet the most delectable tasting dish I have had in a really really really long time. Next for the main course was the Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass-wow!  Another melt in your mouth experience.  We also had some wasabi crusted steak...melts in your mouth, it was like buttah.  We had some scallops and brown rice, it was honestly the best meal I've had in Vegas...it's one of the top 10 dinners that I've had in my life! 

Our waiter Brad deserves his own review.   If Tommy Lee from Motley Crue had a handsome, classy, smart and sweet fabulous twin, this would be him.  Wow! 5-star service! He was super hospitable and friendly.   Very attentive and helpful. He's the best waiter in Vegas! Ask for Brad!

He also brought out a nice dessert for the hubby complete with candle and chocolate written HAPPY BIRTHDAY on the plate.  Brad was also nice enough to give all of us some VIP stamps to check out the nightclub for free! No waiting in line...woohoo!

The downer?  The restrooms say YIN and YANG or something along those lines. So if you've been hitting the sauce, you will just have to try a door. If you see a male bathroom attendant (like I did) you're in the wrong restroom (if you're a girl).  

Another downer? It's one of those restrooms where you can see under the mirrors.  So ladies, if you want to do any SPANX or bra adjustments, do them in the privacy of the water closet. Otherwise, the dudes will get a great show (no wonder I started seeing $1 bills popping under the mirror! WT...?)

Check this place out if you come to Vegas! You'll love it!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"I just found Las Vegas' best kept secret. The vibe at Vintner Grill is old glam Hollywood where white leather sofas, dark Old English bar, art deco chandeliers, and dimly lit candles meets crystal floor lamps. white linens, black and white classic movies and a wine list and menu featuring fabulous picks what more can I ask for?  Phew-I'm outa breath! Ambiance Ambiance! However, with that being said, it did lack some jazzy background music which would have been the perfect touch.

I recommend you dress to impress and request a table in the main dining room so you get the whole experience and people watch.  We were tucked away near the cozy wine cellar where it was quiet but I did miss the table candle and some movie watching. There is some outdoor seating complete with fire-pit and twinkling lights too.  If you don't want a table the bar section is also a roomy option to sit and have dinner or a cocktail.

On this night we were out celebrating Kate's birthday so we started off with some refreshing libations that were featured on the menu. I chose my usual Lemon Drop Martini.  I always request it a bit more sweeter that sour. Pear martini, grapefruit vodka and a fresh ginger vodka concoction was served up in a copper mug for our party of four.

The menu changes a bit with the seasons and that's always a good thing. For starters we chose a fabulous Charcuterie.  The wonderful thing about this choice selection is that you pick out your favorite meats/cheeses/dried fruits/spreads.  Can you say Nom Nom Nom? Served up in a traditional wood board our selection of Lavender Goat Cheese, Manchego, Dried Salami, Prosciutto, Dates, Dried Apricots, Honey and Berry Jam and a basket of bread-BUT I do wish portions were a bit bigger and more bread was in the basket-BUT then I wouldn't have had room for our incredible Calamari Misto complete with battered lemon wedges and a yummy aioli dipping sauce. Everything was delicious. 

Choosing our entree for dinner was a hard choice because the surf and turf Mediterranean choices all sounded mouth-watering. Hmmm, Halibut? Sea Bass, Scallops? Butternut Squash Risotto? Salmon? Braised Short Rib Ravioli? Bouillabaisse? Decisions, Decisions! The food was all so elegantly served with so much love. I enjoyed every bite of my scallops and my hubby's ravioli.  MMMM.

Service was a bit on the super slow side but I don't like to feel rushed especially on a special occasion and your reservation here seems like its yours all night-because were here for about three hours drinking, eating, laughing, drinking, eating, laughing.  The nice thing was that I did see a few well-behaved children-so I'm always liking a place where you're not looked at cross-eyed for bringing in family.

The Sommelier helped to pick out a good wine and nice smooth Cabernet was delivered. Appropriate stemware was brought out too. Ginormous crystal wine glasses that allowed you to sniff, swirl and see the ""legs"" of the wine were much appreciated.

Dessert was not left out and we shared a fresh gourmet strawberry ""shortcake"" type of dessert which was delightful. A candle was placed on Kate's dessert so that was nice.

The song and the prayer I've been singing all these years worked...""Oh Lord won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz my friends all drives Porsches I must make a mends..."" 

Ironic how one of my first jobs I had was working at a Benz dealership back home greeting all the super-star clientele that use to come in and on this day, I was the one treated like a super-star! I guess life does come full circle.

We used our discount thru USAA, and BTW thank you Fletcher Jones for that Military Discount. If you use this service you will go thru the Internet sales rep.  We used Chris and he was very patient in our car quest search. (This is NOT a lease purchase)

We called up the dealership and made an appointment to schedule a test drive a particular vehicle.  When we arrived they had the car sitting in a nice covered parking garage to test.

I spent at least six hours at the dealership with most of the time spent reading over documents and fine print.  

We did not have to haggle since we used our discount thru USAA, so none of our time was spent negotiating on price. I do recommend you do your homework for the car you are purchasing to make sure you get the warranty's that you need.  I regret getting some of the warranties I purchased.

Christine walked us thru the entire vehicle, and honestly you practically need a pilot's license to operate the car...but wow luxury from top to bottom with all the bells and whistles including:

An iphone app that allows you to remotely lock your car and find if it's lost or stolen. 

Keyless Go is the way to go!  No more digging in my handbag for hours trying to find my keys!  Thank you Christine for my nice MB keyrings and pens gift!

Cool auto lighting package that allows the lights to high beam when needed automatically.

Attention Assist-this is cool, so if you're sleepy driving and you start to veer off the road the car makes you pull over.  Power lumbar support that you control and some warm heated seats for those chilly nights!

Navigation system and a real-time satellite weather map and internet to Yelp! Phone system works by telling the car who to call!  ""Call Sofia ""  and it does!

Concierge service at my disposal, ""I need a reservation for two at Eiffel Tower restaurant"", etc.

SOS service, ""Help, I ran out of gas!"", 

Cool 18"" AMG Twin 5-spoke alloy wheels.

DVD player so when the car is parked you could watch a movie while you're parked.

Did I mention the panoramic roof?  Honestly, this was the feature that kept me from not wanting to buy the car, but the hubby talked me into it and I love it.

I've owned luxury vehicles before but wow the new car buying experience here at Fletcher Jones was truly made for royalty.  

Free car washes on the weekend too. 

Well, your'e going to think I'm crazy but I have to admit I love my car so much that I have not even taken it out for a spin since I got it.  But it rides like a dream (from what I remember when I drove it off the lot to my house).

While it sits in my garage, I enjoy sitting in it and I polish it and admire it. I love my car!

But I'm afraid to drive it.  Can you blame me...it's beautiful!

I guess I'll get over the new car scare soon and then I'll be singing another song..""CAR WASH...talking about the Car Wash..."""
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"A gorgeous glass house dripping in chandeliers that smells heavenly!  

This new must-go-to buffet stands out from the grandeur and Romanesque decor that we're accustomed to seeing here.  Truly a juxtaposition of colors, textures and flavors.  Sounds like I'm reviewing a Masterpiece?  Maybe I am. This new Vegas vibe is dominating the strip and Caesar's Palace was not going to be left behind. 

Since this was my first visit I wasn't expecting to love everything, however, the distinguishing characteristic of a buffet for me is that the simplest dishes should taste the best, especially when they're served with such elegance and style as they were here. 

I'll name a list a few tips, hits and some items that surprisingly fell short:
 
Crab legs!   Ask the chef to steam them (although they get busy so you may have to wait) Also I wish the clarified butter was closer to the crabs because there's a door that will slam into you-like it did me-when I was in the area. 

The variety of stations was overwhelming. Chinese, Sushi, Ramen station, Southern comfort food, Seafood (oyster shooters, Paella, oysters on the half shell, ceviche), Italian, Mediterranean, and Mexican-which was my favorite. 

Tamales (very very good moist and full of flavor), Posole with toppings (I will have to try this next time), a revolving cast iron griddle for home made tortillas, Street tacos, Sopes, at least 12 different types of salsa, mushroom soup-my favorite, fajitas, etc. I wonder if they serve Pan Dulce for breakfast? 

Bacchanal buffet is paying attention to its clientele and lots of them come from South of the Border. Did you know that the richest man in the world is a tycoon from Mexico City named Carlos Slim?  Tiffany & Co. in Vegas Crystals should take notes.  I'm sure if he came here, he wouldn't mind some traditional dishes!

Disappointments:  Mexican corn on the cob.  Although the presentation was worthy of a cookbook cover, the flavor lacked and the the corn and husk took up too much room on the plate. If you're going to do street vendor food another option is to shave the kernels to save me the work and put them in a cup. The fajita type beef with peppers was not good, meat was tough and chewy. Table service gets a two-star. Piles of dishes were stacking up and I didn't get my drink until ""round two"". Saw waitress only one other time.

At the seafood stand Halibut was dry. Lobster corn chowder lacked flavor. The layout of the dining room left you weaving in and out of people's tables.  Another downer, some foods were served in small dishes, baskets or mini cast iron bowls so it was hard getting too many items and it made the plate heavy.

I'd have to say the highlight was the 5-star dessert station.  A huge selection of sweetness. Candy jars, gelato, macarons, cake pops, creme brûlée, and leave room for a freshly made crepe and a banana soufflé on request!  

Another highlight was the 5-star service at each kitchen.  I've been to many buffets and the servers behind the counter are usually stoic even those chefs at brunches that leave a tip jar for an omelet but can't even say ""hello"". Here, they went out of their way to make sure you were being helped. I was here with a Yelp group and had a name tag BUT I did see other patrons being helped in the same courteous manner.

Loved the music, creativity of presentation, value, variety of food. A fabulous gourmet spread surely to satisfy every one of your tastebuds.  I plan on coming back with guests and a hearty appetite!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"Wow! How cool is it that I go to the same gym as Nicolas Cage and Coco!  A few Vegas Headliners, World Champion Boxers (Yes, I've seen Floyd here), Cirque de Solei performers, Showgirls, Rhino Dancers and Oscar Winning Actors come here and it's for a good reason (they're rich).

Membership is pricey compared to other places and it will cost you more if you want private lessons (weight training, swimming, pilates, etc.)

Lots of great activities for the kids to enjoy like Rock Climbing, open everyday but Monday.  Kids hours are 5-8 p.m. during the week and 12-4 p.m. on the weekends. The staff at the rock climbing is incredible!!

A fabulous pool with a slide and fountain outside resembling a resort including a cafe serving up yummy burgers, salads and smoothies. Aquatics dept. staff is great but their prices crept up too. Nonetheless some of the best private swim coaches in Vegas can be found here! 

A drop off play area is available also for free on weekdays for two hours so you can workout.  They have all kind of physical activities for the kids to keep busy while you get busy in the gym or take one of the many classes available (yoga, pilates, zumba, spinning, etc.)

Another thing is they try to sell you private workout lessons and they offer a ""free"" overall wellness ""exam"".  I finally got around to scheduling my fitness test and the old lady was really rude and condescending. I didn't appreciate how she talked about previous members and how they scored on their test. Very unprofessional.  A physical and exertion test was also provided as an option. When I did my push ups she said, ""The military wouldn't want you"".  What?!  Who says that to a military spouse or anyone for that matter? I'm sure she was ""joking"" but it was a rude unprofessional remark. I didn't complain about her comment because honestly, I think it would have fallen on deaf ears and I didn't want to feel uncomfortable when working out if I ran into her. So needless to say, I didn't sign up for any lessons.

A Family Locker Room is a big big plus, but I have to say with only two restrooms in the locker room-boo!  Obviously a mommy was not invited to the planning of this area because that is a major shortage or restrooms!  What were they thinking? Plus the location leaves it open for men to walk thru and take a short cut to the pool and they use up the lockers-so now families have to get a key from the front desk-ugh! Hope they find a better solution that is not inconvenient to the families.

Another boo goes to the men's locker room which the hubby said has an ""open concept"" shower!  What? Like you're back in H.S.? Yuk! Privacy please! 

Another boo is the parking lot-it's ALWAYS full so it's a long walk from the covered parking-they should have another entrance in the back.

They also have a gorgeous spa complete with massage and various treatments like hair removal, Juvederm, Botox, etc.  

A hair salon was not left out either nor was a fabulous cafe offering Gluten Free options and lots of salads and healthy treats.  A mini section is in here too where you can buy protein powder and vitamins. This is a great great perk.

Another boo goes to the dry sauna room near the indoor lap pool but honestly what were they thinking with a fish bowl ambiance? Everyone can see you in there?  Really? How can you relax?  Plus, it's co-ed?  Ugh! Tons of gross old men-like I'm really going to in there and relax? Pass. 

On the third floor are squash ball courts (and they rent you out the equipment) and an indoor soccer field and basketball court were not left out.

Overall a nice place with a few boos-but I'm hooked and not leaving anytime soon!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"This review was suppose to start out something like this...For the art aficionado you will appreciate the three original works of art from one of my favorite painters Fernando Botero, who also has a massive original sculpture in the center of this gorgeous restaurant located inside the Encore.  For the foodie aficionado you'll be pleased at the ""surf and turf"" offerings that the menu will delight and tempt you with.

But now, and forever I will have a ridiculous memory of my dinner at Botero. 

My client was in town for the big Air-Show and he invited me to dinner.  Since I work mainly on the phone, years passed since I'd seen him. In this case ten years went by, so this dinner was a big deal, especially since he's the CEO and made time for me in his busy schedule.  I was looking forward to hearing about his prestigious award that was presented to him by John Travolta!

I valet parked and greeted him at the entrance of the Wynn and we had settled on having cocktails in the lobby bar.  As I walk up to greet him my gorgeous leopard strappy shoe busts!  Seriously? Unbelievable! Talk about a deflating moment. Here I was only 30 seconds into welcoming him to Las Vegas and I already look like a clown.

So trying to not feel humiliated, I changed our plans and mentioned there was a bar at Botero and we should have drink there instead.  Well, talk about feeling like you were in a Laverne and Shirley episode.  Here I was all dressed up in a little black dress with high heels and this mile-long shoe strap dangling like a serpent off my foot as I walked through the gorgeous lobby!  It was worse since there were so many people and I could see women staring at my foot.  OMG please ground open up and swallow me now!  This is when I wish I would have bought those red soled shoes!  

So when we arrived at Botero there was a bar and a few cocktail tables.  And you know by this time I was ready for a double vodka martini.  We sat and waited and no service:( and no bartender to be seen:(   No bueno!  So again, I look like a fool assuming we would get bar service at the ""lounge"".  Botero, you let me down.

Our reservations were at 7 p.m. and we decided to grab the table early.  The hostess was very friendly and prior to getting seated I asked a waiter passing by if he had scissors. He quickly found some and I was able to snip of my dangling shoe strap. So that was a life saving moment.

Our waiter was fabulous.  Polite, friendly not overly stuffy.  I ordered a cocktail called the ""Dream"" which was ironic since I was actually in a nightmare. I'm not sure of the ingredients but I saw the pretty picture on the menu and pointed to it.  PIctures on menus are a good idea especially when you're head is in a spiral and you can't think or talk straight.  It had champagne and a hibiscus flower and it was just what I needed (in addition to a double of something really strong).

Next came out a tower of breads...wonderful!  I'm sure they were but I needed to cut back on carbs remember I just busted out of a shoe.  The squash soup was very good but presentation-wise fell a bit short. A dollop of cream and some chives or pomagranite seeds, or pumpkin seeds, shredded apple...some garnish would have been a nice touch.

I ordered the salmon and asked for it to be a bit well done-the waiter did warn me that it can come out looking a bit undercooked so I ordered it probably too overly done and it was a bit dry but the rest of the vegetables that were served with it were heavenly.

The beautiful restaurant was buzzing with lots of the conference attendees.  One of which who happened to be my client's customer none other than Eugene Cernan-Yes, the famous astronaut who was the last man to walk on the moon!  I was very excited to meet him and after my disastrous evening it came to a delightful ending.

I would love to come back and appreciate the paintings and more offerings. The menu looked incredible with so many choices.  I just wish the service at the bar was in existance because I really needed that Tini!"
uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,"I can't think of a better way to end 2013 than to Yelp about the Las Vegas Strip for my 700th review. Surprisingly, the strip or ""the city"" as we refer to it in my household (something about a small child saying 'strip' is bothersome) is only 4.2 miles long. So, if you come to Las Vegas the first thing you should do is bring some walking shoes and of course extra cash to put into the slot machines you just may hit the jackpot.

Flocks of people from all over the world come to see what can only be seen in Las Vegas, 24 hours of glittering lights, food, gambling and entertainment.

They don't call it the ""Entertainment Capital of the World"" for nothing. There's so much to see and do so let me start by sharing a short list of fun facts.
  
Did you know that out the 27 largest hotels in the world 20 of them are on the strip?
Did you know that on May 1, 1967 Elvis Presley married Priscilla at the Aladdin?
Did you know that my niece Sofia was proposed to in front of the Bellagio?
Did you know that I still have not taken the kids to the Tournament of Kings?
Did you know my mother-in-law was a stewardess in the 50's and would work the ""Champagne Flights"" into Vegas and earned bragging rights about the famous passengers she saw like Elvis and Rita Hayworth...just to name a few?
Did you know that many noteworthy celebs have tied the not on chapel strip and a few were also headliners...with the most recent being Britney but most notable Elvis and Sinatra?  

Back in the ""olden days"" the strip was famous for offering cheap dinners, free drinks and lots of glamour.  These days you will find street performers, hobos, coupon peddlers handing out ""girlie club"" flyers, $15 drinks and expensive buffets. But honestly, the entertainment and glamour has literally elevated to amazing circus acts in tanks of water, mind-boggling magic shows, world class performers, high-class cuisine and tons of luxury shopping. Not to mention all the gorgeous hotels and ""free"" entertainment like the famous Bellagio Fountains. It's no wonder people travel from all parts of the world to get a taste of ""What happens in Vegas"".

I'm not a big fan of walking the strip or taking the kids here for a stroll, I prefer to drive my guests down it to see the lights at night-but traffic is horrible. I stay away from the Bermuda Triangle...a word I coined to describe the the three big hotels on Flamingo (NY NY, the castle and MGM).  I do feel a bit safer walking from Bellagio to Cesar's but you will find hobos on those walking bridges too.  Another option is to take the tram, a double-decker bus or wait in a taxi line at a hotel. 

It's the only place where you'll see all the 20-somethings wearing a yard of Strawberry Margarita drink around their necks or groups of girls wearing matching tiaras celebrating a bachelorette party.  It's the place where every woman wears her sparkly glittering outfit that's been sitting in the closet or those outrageous high heels and mini skirts to flaunt at the hottest clubs. It's the place where you can have an Elvis Wedding.

If you love roller coasters you can ride a few and even bungee jump off one of the hotels.  Soon you'll be able to ride a giant ferris wheel.  It's the place where you can see a super star celeb performance every night you're in town.  It's the place where celebrity chefs lend their name to a restaurant in hopes of getting a five-star yelp review.

Regardless, if this is your first time, you'll want to take it all in and thankfully there are many vantage points to do so...Eiffel Tower, Stratosphere Tower, Mandarin Oriental lounge, Mandalay Bay lounge, Maggiano's, etc.  For those that want to see an aerial view of the strip you can take a helicopter ride or for a fun time ride a limo and stick your head out of the moon roof!

Whichever way you choose to see the Las Vegas strip it will be an experience like none other, especially on a night like tonight where many brave the crowds drunks and chilly weather to ring in the new year!       

HAPPY    NEW   YEAR!   VIVA    LAS    VEGAS!"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"Epic Fail!
I am happy to see other reviews of this place that were positive. I am sure you got a different cook than I!
Was meeting a colleague here for lunch, we just needed to decide on something quick close to Northland Mall. This is where we picked!
I had never been, never had heard of this place before, being from out of province originally. We walked inside and were left standing at the front of the restaurant for far too long before being seated. This place looked ok, nothing too special, a teeny bit shabby but I was hoping for a nice meal as I was starving as was my colleague. I swear, this menu gives Denny's a run for its money in terms of items they serve. The menu must be 10 pages front and back, I am not kidding. They do have some lunch items that won't break the bank but all of the other menu items appeared to be quite expensive. I ordered just a chicken taco salad for $16.99 - cannot screw that up too badly right? And I ordered a cup of coffee that I hoped was VERY good for $4 a cup. I might as well have thrown a shot of Baileys in it - how much more could it have been? My friend got a house salad and a French Onion Soup. The food took quite awhile which was funny as the place was not super busy. The salads finally came and then strangely, the soup came a good 15 minutes later when the 2 items were to be served together. But anyways, back to my sloppy mess - it was small cubes of frozen (""spicy"" = not) chicken drowned in bad canned salsa which was then dumped all over my salad! Which by the way had maybe 3 radish pieces in it and 3 carrot slices. Pathetic. If the ranch dressing, sour cream, guac and extra salsa come on the side, why drown my meal in red goo making it almost inedible.
I did get free coffee refills. And I thought the server was OK until my colleague asked me, ""Did you see those huge dangling GUN earrings she is wearing?"" I had not, oh boy, time to get the bill and get going! I did get a piece of Cheesecake to take home to the man thinking - well, that is their name, the Cheesecake Company so the cakes should be good? Am I just too trusting or what? The cheesecake was horrible, I just cannot in good conscience recommend the key lime cheesecake. That is so sad! Key Lime is supposed to make people happy-happy and it was just a disaster. I am not sure how they got the cheesecake itself green, I would have picked a different slice had I known!
Won't ever go back again. I give 2 stars instead of 1 as I have not felt sick yet. I so thought I was going to be...!"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"I seem to crave Pho on a daily basis... is this weird? I just cannot get enough of it and I figure, it is a brothy soup - it has to be healthy enough right? So, I had an hour to kill between appointments and fighting traffic to go get my husband from work downtown. I love dining alone at times at an informal place to just say AHHHH and relax with a magazine and my thoughts as I eat. I am the type of person that once I get my meal, I kind of need 5 minutes of silence to breathe everything in, to see and taste. Too intense? Maybe but that makes me foodie-ish for sure.  So anyways, I wanted to be on or near Centre St NW and I quickly asked my hubby via phone about this place once I pulled into the parking lot. (was so glad there was parking and it was easy to find on the street, I totally picked a place at random) Hubby gave it a thumbs up from what he saw on-line so in I went. It was deadsville as it was an odd time of the day - 300pm or so. This was good as I got to talk to the owner's son and learned they had been in biz 12 years. I asked what the most popular soup was and he responded, ""Curry Soup"". Me, Janna who goes against the grain on most things ordered something else - the spicy seafood soup (had a chile printed next to it so right up my alley) and ordered no calamari but extra shrimp instead. No problems with that, so crabstick and shrimp it was. As I pondered my surroundings I thought, ""Yep, this is a hole in the wall as the others said it was on-line and the floor could use a good sweep but these places serve the best food, right?"" Hot Jasmine tea came out straight away and I was so thankful - 1 - because I love it and 2 - it was a billion degrees below zero. Brr. The server was relaxed but aimed to please and I never felt in a rush. My food came out piping hot and I took it all in at my leisure. YUM. I was told that the Mom here makes the soup and wow, I wish my mom lived close by and could cook soup like that! The rice noodles in the soup (my fave) were the perfect texture, fresh onions floated about, the seafood was plump, delectable and the broth, perfect, Just like Pho should be. It was the Large bowl, I cannot imagine what the other choice would look like, the Extra Large bowl! The meal came with lime and bean sprouts and basil. Yum! It was a good experience and a cheap one at that! Under $10 including the free tea!
I am coming back here for sure and darn it, I am going to go for that curry soup next time!! I love supporting family restaurants and this place being open 6 days a week sure earned a good review."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"This last trip to Vegas this past week marks about my 17th time there. Never in my widest dreams had it ever occurred to me to stay at Bally's. We have walked through the casino many a time, stayed at Paris at least twice (they are connected) but always thought maybe the rooms would be too small, too dated. I had an opportunity this past trip to take advantage of a complimentary room for 2 nights at Bally's. Why not? Tis true, you cannot beat the location and being central to the action is prime when you are only in town generally for a few days. You want to have access to the best shopping and the best restaurants right? I am glad my personal reservations did not get in the way of me booking this fab hotel. It was clean and more spacious than many a fancy-pants Vegas room I have stayed in. I was taken a bit aback by the line-up to check in but I have encountered that before at other locations so we kept our cool. The other downside like any other Vegas hotel/casino is the cigarette smoke. In Bally's it hits you as soon as you walk in to the hotel but I think over the years, the ventilation system has improved, even if only slightly. Staff at the front desk was curt and to the point, did not care much about our reservation preference for a king bed and we ended up with 2 queens but hey - the place was busy and the room was free. We were lucky at the time of booking that the resort fee had not come into effect yet - now I believe one has to pay to stay, per day. (pool, use of phone etc like every other Vegas hotel)
The elevators were quick, the casino has a decent layout and there are dining choices but not too many for late-night. (run over to Paris and grab a slice of wood-fired pizza!)
The room itself as mentioned was spacious as was the washroom. Decent mattress, quiet neighbours and good water pressure in the shower made for a decent overall stay. When you check out in the AM, you can get a nice cup of coffee next to the reception for $4. (Yikes, but the room does not have a coffee maker at all which is a bit of a bummer and I almost took off another point for this)
We walked down to the pool one day which was open and had a nice, quiet atmosphere.
Free valet which was great as we had a rental car but be prepared to wait for your car. No call-ahead so in line you go and hope for the best. 
RIGHT on the strip. Not a lot of walking involved to get outside and be in the heart of it all.
I would have no problem staying here again even if the rooms were not comped. The value is there as long as you are not expecting 5 star treatment."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"With no family in town, we made Ruth's Chris our ""X-mas dinner spot""!  I made reservations for my husband and I for 5pm on Dec 23. We arrived, were seated at a place for 2 and I was surprised the place was not packed this evening. It never seemed to get more than 3/4 full which was nice as the service was fantastic. Something about having 5 or so waiters helping you with everything; water, bread, bus boys, main waiter, food server, etc. I still do not like the carpet in this place - I think they can afford to go with hard wood? I had this same feeling the last time I was in for lunch and still feel that way! We ordered a drink to start, beer and a vodka tonic. We also ordered a very nice bottle of wine from Argentina, a Malbec. $46 for the bottle. I found out that you can bring your own wine here but there in a $40 corking fee. Ouch!  Crab cakes were ordered to start. I liked them a lot - the crab was lump so you could really taste it without a lot of filler. A little cool in the centre but we gobbled them up. We also ordered the ""Full meal"" - included, you can have a salad, entree and a side dish. Good value. I had petite filet rare, and scallops with asparagus and my husband ordered petite filet med. rare with garlic mashed potatoes. We both ordered the caesar salads which were very good, fresh cheese grated on top, not too dressed and served on COLD plates, yay! (nice that we could sub the caesars for the listed house salad, no extra charge) The steaks come out hot on 500 degree plates doused in butter! So good, we both loved the steaks, cooked perfectly. I loved my scallops as well. I guess since by the time we ordered coffees, we were teetering on the $200 mark for dinner and we were offered free desserts!!!! Or it could have been just out of the server's kind regard that it was in fact out X-mas dinner! I got the apple crisp pie a la mode and it was huge! That went in the leftover bag with half my dinner! Hubby got the banana cream pie and he loved it. He had to take half home as well. He loved the real little bananas on top! He also had leftovers from dinner. We learned that the desserts were made in house. Bonus mark for that! NOTE: the side dishes are quite large and we were impressed! Overall, we left very happy and very full and our plans for a movie afterwards got sidelined by a lay-down on the couch at home! I would have given it a 5 star rating but yep, the carpet in there annoys me as mentioned and the server had no idea what the Specials were nor soup of the day and had to keep going to the back to the kitchen to ask. We will be back though!"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"No frills here but you get what you pay for.
Walking in to check-in was a zoo. There was one woman employee on site only to handle all the calls and walk-ins and let me tell you, she was losing her mind! I prayed that I never needed to call her for anything!
We finally got into our room for our 3 day stay. First thing I noted was that the room was decent in size and clean enough. The walls are in fact paper thin as other reviewers have pointed out and we seriously had Godzilla staying above us. I am not sure what was going on up there but I did not sleep for 3 nights here due to all the stomping, jumping, running on the floor above us (we mentioned it at check out and no one gave a rat's behind). And of course during New Years, every other room was taken so we stayed put and said nothing until we left. 
If you choose to stay here, try to get a room on the 3rd (top) floor so you do not have to deal with what we had to. Poor construction may be to blame also. Earplugs will not drown out how noisy it is here if you have inconsiderate neighbors.
Late check out will cost you $20. I have never seen or heard of a 10am check out before. Lame. I heard too you will pay $25 extra if you want to check in before 4pm.
No food on site (vending machines, yes, oh and breakfast supposedly available) but there are a lot of other businesses around like Albertsons for groceries and drug stores/restaurants down the road. You will have to have a car though. If patient enough to wait for the hourly shuttle, you can get to the strip that way that will take you to Tropicana.
We had a studio unit room so we had a microwave, fridge, coffee machine. Mugs and glasses, plates, all provided. We liked that.
I had to struggle with the internet for the first night. Make sure you open a browser to sign in as you are not automatically connected using the free wifi. 
There are 2 buildings (I think these are time share units) so make sure before you unpack your vehicle, that you are at the right building. Parking is free. make sure you keep the slip on your dash and you will have to provide the front desk with your license plate #.
Park in a well lit area as there were many undesirables living out of shopping carts in the area lurking around. Security was visible here often at this hotel, good to see.
As for little extras like decent toiletries, forget it, make sure and bring your own.
There was a jetted tub which I never got to use but I liked this feature. The worst thing about the bathroom was the counter space.
Pool - yes but it was zero degrees when we were there! 
Grounds are well kept. 
Overall, 2.5 stars."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"Deaf in my ears from leaving Ranchman's regarding a charity event and a rumblin' in my tummy - I had not eaten all day as per usual. So we hopped on over across the street to Tony Romas before the kitchen closed down (11pm) and in we went. Only us and the crickets at the hostess stand and I was afraid all the chefs would be PISSED that they would have to cook for 2 more customers. The server finally came by and we were seated in a booth. We noted that this location on line had a low rating both on Yelp and Urban Spoon. However, I had a hankering for ribs and a $25 gift card burning in my pocket. The atmosphere, ya, I have to admit, BLAND as one reviewer said, for sure. And the music, again (just like the Keg in one of my past reviews), the satellite music that just blares out one hit wonder 80's tunes and not good ones at that.  Awful, so the place loses an entire star just on that. Cheri was our server and she was delightful. Nice gal. I saw that the Caesars were on special so I had one of those, extra, extra hot and hubby ordered his usual draft beer. Fri nights the Caesars are on for $5.50 for 1 oz. I ordered the half rack of ribs with garlic mashed and the broccoli. I always cringe when I order broccoli as you never know if you will get it raw, wilted or just nasty/old/soggy. Also ordered was a hamburger, just the house classic. Both meals took a bit but it was worth the wait. Great portion sizes, nice ribs with my sauce on the side, hot potatoes for a change and wonderfully steamed broccoli! Impressed! The burger looked good too, so full o' stuff that it fell apart after 3 bites! The fries upgraded for $2 to yam fries was a stellar move. So crispy, obviously made to order and deelish! Giant server of those!
So as I am eating, I remembered that I had this free dessert coupon from a Tony Romas in Ontario. What the hell! I will ask! Cheri checked with her manager and the coupon did not apply as we were in another province BUT she advised that her manager wanted to congratulate us on our 6 month anniversary and that he would like to buy us dessert! How nice! We ate our meals, had some left over to take home and then we dove into the mud pie dessert. 1 -2- 3- GO! 
Oh God, it was good! Settling up was a breeze and we left happy and full, closing the place down as we so often do!
It was a convenient place to come and I would come back if friends asked to meet here. I would not go out of my way to come here as it is far from home but other than the music and the fact that it has that typical chain restaurant feel, I really do not have a bad thing to say about it. I am still full and satisfied hours later!"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"My husband had a hankering for steak tonight so the sub I picked up for him went into the fridge for lunch tomorrow and out we went. We thought we would try the Keg on MacLeod for the first time. I only eat red meat MAX once a week so when I do have it, I like it to be very good. The Keg is normally pretty consistent with its standards and that is important to me. You always just have to pray you get good service. Tonight was a bit of a miss in that area overall...
We arrived, 6pm. 20 minute wait. We found one of the only tables left in the lounge which was comfortable enough and we thought we would order a drink and stay put there for dinner. On our minds to order the whole way there were the mushrooms neptune. They did not disappoint! With the mushrooms we enjoyed a beer (my husband chose Molson M as his choice) and I had a dirty martini even though I cringe at paying $10 a drink. The waitress was friendly enough, very rehearsed but forgot my water I had ordered and then forgot my lemon to go with it. When the lemons did come out for the water they were all dry and ""dead"". I was told they would all be like that - ok, no problem. The time in between the appetizer and mains was very long. Too long, maybe 45 min to an hour. That was a first for me at the Keg, good thing we were not in a major rush. The Ottawa hockey game was on which I enjoyed very much throughout the meal and bar staff was nice enough to leave that TV alone for me when all the others were being changed to the Calgary game. I should have asked for his name, that was a nice gesture. During our meal, a manager came out to check on us, as did later, the GM. Both very nice men and I would come back just to have a chat with them again! The mains consisted of; top sirloin cooked medium rare, 8 oz. and was cooked to perfection. Mine was a rare pecan crusted sirloin with goat cheese 8oz. YUM, I love this dish and does not weigh in nearly the most expensive meal on the menu. 2 asparagus pieces adorned the plate as did 2 very small pieces of red pepper for colour.The twice baked potatoes are our fave and these were fantastic as always. Again, consistency is key for us - why else go to a chain restaurant? We passed on dessert and coffee and had to ask the manager for to bring our bill. When it did come, it was another 20 min to get the bill paid even though our credit card was out for that long sitting on the table. As stated before, the service fell down a LOT tonight but we still had a nice night out. And the Ottawa Sens won 4-1! 
$73 fed the two of us before tip and we got to bring leftovers home for later! 3 stars for tonight's experience. We would come back..."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"We went in here for dinner, excited to try the chain, our expectations up very high from all the positive reviews.
We were set up at the bar until seating became free in the lounge as it was going to be 90 min to be seated. The bar is this tiny strip of quartz where having a drink is not so comfortable. You are in the zone where the waitresses converge, waiting for their tables` drink orders.
A glass of red wine at $9 appears to measure about 3 oz in the glass. It was 5 sips worth and then gone.  Good though, I had asked for a Malbec.
The menu looked interesting - but very overpriced.
Ordered: crab cakes to start as a shared appy - $13. Tiny morsels (2) dressed in thousand island dressing with tiny can-like crab flakes and hunks of potato that should have been crab. I had asked not only our server what was good at Redwater before we dove into our menus. Needless to say I was let down by this suggestion.
My husband ordered the steak which upon asking staff was told that it was quite comparable to the Keg in how they prepare it and present it. Wrong. The steak looked awful on top of mashed potatoes (those were good at least) surrounded by a few beets slices. No pizazz, no colour. Not worth $26 and that was for the smallest 8oz! We were so hungry so we did eat our food but our server could see we were not impressed. We had asked for more bread - that was also good, served with a pomegranate butter that gave the bread some good tang.
I had asked for a pasta substitution which would have cost me another $7 - no. I just ordered the mussels, again recommended and they were just - OK. Very bland in a tomato sauce but not as bland as the poor steak sitting across from me. We had to pour some of my mussel juice on top of the steak to give it a bit of flavour. You are able to choose a topping for your ""naked"" steak and my guy chose the garlic poblano butter which did absolutely nothing for the meat. To be fair, the cut of meat was good but the grill surely was not hot enough when the meat was put on as none of the steak had any kind of colour to it, limp, no char. 
A manager had come to our table after some time and asked if everything was good and we answered that it was just OK. She prompted us for comment and we politely told her our issues with the food, giving some positives as well such as - our server was nice and the restaurant itself was beautiful. She thanked us for feedback and that she would talk to the chef. She asked to buy us dessert but we just settled on a coffee each. It was not enough to make up for what we had to pay for.
Not sure we will return, never to this location anyways on Uxbridge. Maybe the one on Macleod is better... ?"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"This was our first time eating here - we had tried before to get inside but the line-up was huge. Tonight, we had to wait at least 20 min in the corridor waiting for our name to be called and I was starving!!! (No reservations at all unless you are a group of 8 or more)  Once we were in, everything was a breeze. I had not seen this style of dining before - the server comes up to your numbered table with plates and cutlery and introduces him/herself. You then yourself have to order what you would like for food or drink at the front counter. Then your server comes back and he/she will then serve you the remainder of your meal, any other drinks, desserts etc. that yypu may like. Hmmm. We rolled with it. The food came out quickly. We each had an appy (soup or salad) and a half pizza which actually comes out as a personal sized one. (only $11!) VERY good, the crust was the BEST. That doughy, chewiness that is hard to find these days on a thin crust. We had Primavera and another one that was similar, just with ham on it, good quality toppings. 
The pizza oven here was imported from Italy - impressive! I had read reviews of this restaurant here on Yelp before we went out and I fell in love with a pic of the fire roasted tomato soup someone had posted. I asked the gal behind the counter taking our order if the soup was as good as it looked on-line and she said it was the best ever. She was right!!! It was served piping hot, seasoned perfectly, it was so fresh that I could just see the tomatoes roasting away in my mind! The other appy we ordered was a caesar salad and it was a good portion, very good. It was lightly sauced so that you did not get too full on it - you want to enjoy your pizza right? :) And it had a garlic pizza wedge! In the little display case at the till,sat a couple of Tiramisu desserts left - hubby's fave. We ordered quickly before we sat there and just got too full with time and it was a 10 out of 10 decision. This was THE BOMB! (and I am not a dessert person) Imported from Milan Italy, flash frozen I was told, this beautiful dessert is brought all the way here for us to enjoy. We almost bought more to take home but stopped ourselves. Make sure you get this dessert and get the whipped cream and chocolate on top when they offer it!
This may not make for fine dining, there is limited seating and you may have to wait but it is clear to me why people keep coming back here - the food is amazing. The service was fine too for what they have set up for service. Maybe ordering at the counter just keeps things flowing more smoothly. I am not sure. But, we will be back!!!!
2 meals, 1 glass of wine, 1 draft  beer, 1 dessert = $49.84 not inc. tip! Not bad!"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"We stayed at the Signature for 4 nights as we got a pretty good deal for this 5 star hotel on the strip. I always enjoy staying somewhere different and the high end treatment is a personal treat.
I had requested on Expedia (room and flight included) that it was our first time here and could we please get a nice floor. Signature did not disappoint! We checked in and we were floored that we scored a Penthouse in Tower 1! Floor 35! There are about 38-40 floors in this building.
I have seen from other reviews that most people had balconies - we did not but we did not even notice. We had a nice kitchenette, fully stocked which does not happen with a kitchen all too often - normally you have to call down for this or that. Coffee maker, toaster, blender, stove burner, all included. I have never seen a blender in a hotel room, ever.
We blew a light bulb when we walked into our room turning on a lamp and someone was around very quickly to replace that after our call and set up our safe which had been shut prior to our arrival and unusable until security came to fix it. Oh, and housekeeping came for extra coffee - very needed. Everyone was cheery with a smile on their faces - all the staff seemed to be aware that service meant a LOT to this hotel.
We had a King bed and a pull out cot/couch - there is a centre divider there so you are not having to look at the person sleeping on the other side of the room, thankfully. The room is not huge, but comfortable.
The TV was awesome, then the bathroom had another smaller flat screen TV. 
The huge jetted tub was the nicest and best I have ever been in. If you are a bath person like me, there is nothing like getting in from partying at 530am and being able to take a nice long soak. (use caution! Ha! It is DEEP!)
The property was clean and they had a lot of things going on, gift shop, Starbucks, The Lounge where you could have a drink...
Tower 1 is closest to the MGM and I had seen a lot of people complaining via reviews about the walk to the casino but it really is not that bad. They even have 3 motorized walkways that help you get to where you want to go faster. And then out the MGM doors you go and you are on the Strip!
I loved that Signature was non-smoking and non- gaming. Very safe and very quiet. Classy.
I would stay here again even despite the resort fees of $28 a day. (includes wireless that works very well)
We did not make it down to the pool but it was hopping on the hotter days we were there... next time. 
The only downside was after check out - a grand place like this did not have anyone holding the door and no taxis were waiting outside - one was called for us. A small thing but a nice exit with a personal touch woud have meant a lot."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"This review has really nothing to do with service. Service was really lackluster, not memorable but the waiter was decent and deserved his 15% tip but nothing more.
We booked a table on line for my husband's birthday as we had never been here before and it was close to his office. The restaurant on a Thursday at 1pm was not busy at all.
We learned that the restaurant is open from 11am-2pm, it closes down and reopens for dinner at 5pm. It is open until 9pm typically and then later until 10pm in the summer. 
The restaurant revolves once around in 45 min at lunch and it takes hour to go around at dinner.
Fun little facts that I would be interested in knowing before dining here perhaps!
The view was clear and high up and well, it was Calgary. 
Hubby ordered a burger with fries. I asked and the burger could not be cooked to order. What a shame and a disrespect to the meat but rules are rules! On the heels of that question came out a charred and I mean, burned patty. The fries however were well seasoned, fresh and crispy. That was the only good thing about his dish for a $17 burger meal.
I wanted to eat light so I ordered the Albacore tuna, BIG mistake. I had never had this before and it was ugly. So ugly, yellow/fleshy coloured and they KNEW that too so they had to hide the 'fish' under a bed of frisee lettuce and thinly sliced radishes and onion. I am not that picky of an eater and love all fish but I could not eat this. Who wants to return a dish though during a birthday lunch? My husband said he would choke it down and I ordered the soup, minestrone to replace my meal. I asked and was advised that the soup of the day was in fact made fresh daily. It was pretty good but under-seasoned by a lot and I had to ask for a salt shaker. Ya, a hit to the chef I know. It was what it was and now that I think about it, I was mildly annoyed at the time that I had to pick the soup and there was no fish of the day to check out as advertised on the menu.
Our intention initially was to have coffee before we left but the fun balloon was deflated and all we wanted to do was leave and hit Starbucks. Some of the dessert choices looked interesting but, nah. A nice touch, hubby got a single little scoop of vanilla ice cream with a lit candle on it as a parting gift for his birthday.
The bill came and to my surprise, the terrible tuna AND the soup were both on the bill when it was obviously not enjoyed and I had mentioned that at the time.
The soup was taken off without delay and we left, likely never to return again.Too bad as had they passed the grade for lunch we would have come back to see the city from above at night. They will not get our business again, there seems to be too many other good restaurants in town. Charcut, we should have selected you...."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"We went out for girl's night for a birthday - there were 4 of us on a Friday night.
I arrived at around 730pm and while I sat on the bench at the front waiting for my friends, I was given a couple of sips worth of red wine in a nice glass while I waited! I assume this was a manager - nice touch! 
As I waited I took in the space and learned a bit about the restaurant. I had not been before and had heard mixed reviews on it. I found the atmosphere to be busy, vibrant, electric. The lounge to the left of the entrance of course was noisy and was later told that it could get a little out of hand (fights) so I would advise people to leave the kids at home if you choose to come here, on weekend nights anyways. The space was beautiful. High wooden beams, dimly lit, open kitchen, the staff seemed professional (OMG, I do not know how these gals wear 4 inch heels all night but they all looked sharp).  Middle of the road type place between casual and fancy.
This restaurant does not take reservations so when my friends arrived, I was thrilled that we got a large table for 6. Lots of room for our jackets, purses... There is also a bar you can sit at in the restaurant if the lounge is not for you.
I have only been to a couple of Joey's in my lifetime and I do adore the menu choices. It took all of us a long time to choose as we were lovin' on our drinks. I went with the Ahi Tuna Salad and other than the missing mango which was later rectified, I was really happy with it. One of the reasons I ordered the salad was for the mango and all the waitress could say is that the kitchen staff are very ""stingy"" with the mango..? Huh? But when I got it, the chunks were sooo good in the salad. I should not have had to ask for it though...
My friends got Caesar salads, ribs, chicken, steak, salmon and everyone was happy with their meals. The spring rolls that hold the loaded baked potatoes were genius and beyond delicious.
The lava cake for the b-day girl was not available (server said day staff had overcooked them all) but we got these little donut things with lemon curd on a plate that were the bomb. Nothing free here for birthdays.
The Washington Riesling - order this if you love white wine!
Service was good, not excellent (maybe her attitude could have been a tad better but bad days happen and it was busy) but we never wanted for anything. Drinks were refilled as were our water glasses. The waitress did split the bill for us and without cracking a smile, POOF she was off and running never to be seen again. 
I would certainly come back here with friends. For date night I may choose somewhere different but coming from the NW of the city on a freezing cold, snowy night, I was not disappointed with my friend's choice to come downtown.
We had an absolute blast!"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"Wow. I have no idea how this place stays in business after our experience tonight and all the reviews on Yelp here that I have just read.
Having not read the reviews prior to going (which is highly unusual), it was my brilliant idea to ask some friends to join us at this Chili's location. I had been to one once in Michigan many moons ago and it was pretty good so I wanted to hit this place up to see what it had to offer. OK, even I can make foodie mistakes. :(
We walked in and our friends had already grabbed a table. It took 15 minutes at least for me to order a drink, a lime margarita. My friend across the table from me had asked me if I had read the reviews about this restaurant. I shook my head. She advised that out of approximately 18 reviews on another review site, 17 were bad. Oh no, I thought to myself but opted to hope for the best. At least the company we keep is good!
I asked the waitress what was good to eat here. She told me to stay away from the tacos, that she gets a lot of complaints on those. She pointed out maybe 6 things that she felt were satisfactory and I opted to go for one of them - the $25 ribeye steak that came with mashed potatoes, veg and a piece of garlic toast. I ordered the steak RARE, same as always. The food took awhile but it was just an observation, we were in no real rush. My marg was pretty good so I kept busy enjoying that. It was cold and frosty and the mug size was pretty good for $7.
My meal finally came out and I could just tell that the meat was going to be overcooked. I guess the look on my face said it all and I was asked to cut into my steak to check for doneness. Yep, it was cooked well-done! Grrrr! ????? How could this happen! The server scooped it up right away knowing I had asked for a rare steak so now I got to watch all my friends eat their food! Lovely! Other things ordered by friends were fajitas, ribs and a steak sandwich. No serious gripes about those.
When my meal came out I thought it had to be a joke from the kitchen staff. Now my meat was so raw, it looked like it had just come out of the package except for a couple of light grill marks on the surface! I just did not want to deal with it so I kept it, took it home later so I could cook it myself. My friend kept remarking how gross it looked. The server at this point whether she really cared or not, I have no idea but she advised that she was removing the steak from the bill. Ahhhh - ya, do ya think?! The manager had come over twice and apologized but really, what could be done to make things any better? OK, maybe a bottle of wine but that did not happen.
I will never, ever come here again nor recommend to anyone. A Tex-Mex restaurant that cannot even cook a steak? C'mon.
I would have given it 1 star but the margarita I had saved it and made it a humble 2 star experience."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"FINALLY detoured the Keg, grabbed a few friends and made it out to Caesar's!
Free valet was a wonderful option that the restaurant provides and we took it. The valet guy was great, prompt and honest as my husband left his brand new cell phone in plain view in the console and it was not touched.
Walked inside and WOW, the place is much larger than it looks from the outside, cavernous almost!
We were seated way at the back at 530pm (with resos) in a cave-like area as the ceilings were lower in that spot. I liked it, and I liked that at first we were the only diners in at that point. It did fill up by 8pm or so, good crowd.
I personally loved the red, old school, gangster feel to the place. I had it all built up in my head from what I had read from on-line reviews and it did not disappoint.
Our server was older, reserved, polite but in all honesty, I felt like he would have rather been doing cartwheels on the moon than serve tables this evening.
Our friends had been before and pointed out to us the menu area of Emperor's Feast where you get a steak/entree, bread to start along with a garden salad, your choice of dressing) and a little French Onion soup. For me, it was a lot of food and I brought home half my entree but I chose the wrong cut of steak for this restaurant. I was so looking forward to being able to ""cut the meat with my butter knife"" but on the NY Strip, this did not happen and my friend beside me also was disappointed in how tough hers was. She said it could have been an off day or bad meat selection as she has had the strip before here and said it was terrific. The men at the table scored with their steaks, those being a rib eye and the 10oz Filet. Both sumptuous, I got to try both and nothing needed additional seasoning. The server seemed to understand the trouble with the strips and his manager was nice enough to take $15 off each steak without us even asking for compensation of any kind. Classy. This review would have garnered a 4 or 4.5 if the meat had been a nicer cut, but the cookery itself was spot on. I loved how I could see the steak grilling from our table, outside the kitchen.
I loved the little details of this place - like how the salad plates were stone cold as they should be and the dinner plates were hot. The soup was OK, salad great and the bread was fantastic. My friend beside me went into orbit over their parm cheesy bread, a nice twist on fresh Texas Toast. I preferred the garlic toast included in the basket but both rated as excellent. Refills of the bread were no problem.
The table did not love how the skinny glasses of pop at almost $4 each did not include refills. But, the meals were a great value starting at $38 for the rib eye.
We would absolutely go back just for the originality of the place but I am sure there are other steakhouses in Calgary to try first.
3.5 stars."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"We had wanted to try this place out and it happened to be a Thursday, a jolly good pub night one may say...!
Walked in and it was quite loud, as expected. It was moderately busy but we were able to find a booth and planted ourselves down after a long day. The flat screens built into the ends of the booth were a nice touch. I also liked that the Specials were on the table in small menu form and every single day of the week has something going on. Grasshopper pints were on sale for the Man and we noted that Thurs was also pizza night! Perfect. A 2 topping pizza for $6.99. The late night menu comes out after 10pm which still has a lot on it to choose from. We were also given a regular menu to look at just to see the variety of dishes they have for lunch and dinner. Note - no curry dishes - they had tried that and that did not fly but you will find all the other typical English pub dishes.
We were offered to try Fruili which I believe is a German style sweet beer that is made with a ton of real strawberries. It even came pink in the glass! That was neat even for me to try as I am not a beer drinker, I did stick with my Vodka/Crans! For sure a gal's beer or the guys I am told mix it with Strong Bow or Guinness and that has become a House fave!
The pizza came out Artisan style with that less than perfect round crust (loved that!) and we dove right into our bacon and mushroom Za. Not bad at all. The bacon was real, wish there had been more on there but for $6.99, a great deal. Even the cheese was good and stringy, it for sure passed my cheese test! The dough was good and it was cooked perfectly.
We had told our server Ashley that it was our first time at Tudor and she gave me a tour of the patio which was really nice looking with the beams and fireplace, very classy. She explained that there was a big private room in the back beyond the curtains saved for special events. She was a great waitress and it was a nice change to have found great service in someone who took a lot of pride in her job!
I liked the fact that the pub was large and airy, had a lot of wood going on and had a new, clean feeling to it. It has been open maybe for 2 years. Music was good, Top 40, not too loud. 
Back to the food...
The pizza was not enough for us so we dove into an order of 3 mini-sliders which miniaturizes the 3 burgers they have on the reg. menu so you can choose your fave - British burger (mmm that warm homemade BBQ sauce! And bacon!), the Tudor burger (basic) and then the Mexi burger (covered in jalapenos). All deelish! Mexi won out for both of us but just by a teeny bit over the Brit burger. The meat was sooo tender! Almost everything on the menu is homemade, all the desserts are too!
We will for sure be back, Sundays have the Fish and Chip Special, apparently very popular days for eating. Friday and Saturday nights I am told are very busy for drinking! But of course!"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"REVIEW 100!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  YA!

So, we moved to the NW and are in the market for a Central Vac. We have to budget all over the place for all kinds of things with the house that does not even have a backyard yet let alone a deck or my beloved hot tub (stay tuned folks, haha!) so I did not want to be spending more than $1000 for a simple vac including installation, even better if cheaper. So we had asked around, I even went on FB asking any Calgarians I know who is best in the city for both price and service in this industry. This NW biz was mentioned by others and it is not too far away so I figured I would just roll on down the road and check it out!  I met my husband there after he was done work and we got the schpeal from the guy working there - not sure if he was the owner or manager but he was the only one there. The place is newer, I am not sure how new but they must do OK as they have a South location as well. The store was small, clean and had stock here and there on the walls - floor cleaning kits, vacuums, vacuum bags. Does anyone still use vac bags, OMG!
The other reason we went in here is that they have an advertised $699 special (plus $150 installation) that this company is promoting. But as soon as you get there and they go over how the vac works, they try and upgrade you to the $999 plus, plus. Smooth, slick, upselling and I get that but we were very clear on what we wanted, why we were there and our budget. My husband gets snowed easily and rarely wants to go the rock bottom price route as he believes that best is better. Fine. BUT I am the one paying for this house upgrade so the guy soon learned that this was not my first rodeo. The employee was getting a bit antsy as it was getting close to closing time (6pm) and he was a bit rough handing us the vac tools and taking them back, overall just a sense of not being very nice! I did not get a good feeling as the guy appeared to be losing patience while I asked a few key questions.
We decided to leave to be able ""to talk it over"" as the guy pleaded with us as we were walking out that it would just take 2 min to do the paperwork to get the deal done.
I just got a bad feeling that while the product looked great, I wanted the deal and was not about to get a great deal. I was told that for the bit of carpet we have in our home, the $699 attachments were just not going to cut it as the carpet would break the belt of the handheld so we HAD to upgrade. So, they sell crap then?
My $699 deal plus install was now $300 more minimum and while I am not saying the company false advertises, they do not stand behind their ""special"" deal products on hand  and want more of your money. Not mildly, overtly. I want to be sure that when I buy something, the company will back up their products and I would be afraid to read the fine print here if our system was to break down.
Think we will shop around some more."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"We are avid Vegas travelers.
We paid extra for an upgraded room here - thought we would try it out as it is one of the only properties we have not stayed in.
The line up upon arrival to check in was INSANE. Yes, Vegas is about crowds, smoke and line ups but there has to be something this hotel can do to speed up the process. Maybe have staff come through the line with a clipboard and some room keys?
Here are some tips about the ""UPGRADE"" which is said to involve superior amenities.
We paid extra to check into our room right away after getting our keys and the maids were still cleaning it.  Nice, waiting outside our room after long flights with our luggage.
To stay in our non-smoking room is like sucking on a fresh cigarette every second. The smoke comes in through the vents 19 floors down, or through the smoking rooms. Health hazard, I feel like crap now! A maintenance guy came to spray disinfectant that did nothing. How do you combat incessant smoke billowing into your room without wearing a mask?
Do not expect a quiet room anywhere - the walls are paper thin. Our neighbors are lovely.... So. Not. Front desk are indifferent, will tell you to call security.
Satellite TV is so choppy that a half hour show went out about 20 times. The fact that we are not here to watch TV is besides the point. We are paying for the amenities and the problem as per the engineer that just left here is that our room's TV was not pixilated yet, so it is a known issue at least for our room. Not good.
One day we were half dressed just back in from the pool and 4 guys came into our room to look into the TV issue! ??? I asked them if they would have come in here without our being here and they answered yes. Kind of odd, that made us feel a bit uneasy. Our cleaning lady has been ok (keeps forgetting to leave us coffee!) but I met a couple in the elevator from another floor who stated that their maid rifled through their knapsack's bottom and stole $20 in change. Jeez!
We had to call the front desk to ask about the smoke, the TV and to ask for a do not disturb sign for our door.
The casino itself is OK, older but has character and the pizza in the food court, NY style is really good as is the baked ziti and chicken parm. Large portions. Staff at the shops at Flamingo are hit and miss with their personalities.
The TV built into the bathroom mirror is cool and the extra shower jets were neat. The shower did not run out of hot water once.
The location of Flamingo on the strip cannot be beat and that is why many stay here as well as a cheaper stay for those budgeting all their cash for gambling.
Next door to the north, MargaritaVille Casino has just opened up. Right next door to the south, Cromwells Hotel and Casino has opened up and that is a nice space to go and check out to see the type of atmosphere not offered by Flamingo.
For spoiling yourself and luxury, choose Vdara, Encore at Wyynn, Signature at MGM or Aria instead."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"I could write a lot about this place. I will TRY to keep it brief as I answer questions I had going in!
I love all things Thai. It was only natural that the goodness of Yelp steered me in this direction to check this place out and get a much needed foot massage! Yippee! The start of my new life, ME going HERE all the time now!
Reservations - as one other reviewer pointed out, you have to have a credit card to book in case you are a no-show. Understandable. You have 24 hours to cancel and they will not run your credit card through until after your massage time slot. They will call you the day before and confirm your time and ask you to come in 10 min early re paperwork if you are a first-timer.
Parking - no worries. Pay in the pay per use lot where Ducky's Pub is. Run in, give the gal at the counter your license plate and the guy checking the lot will pop in supposedly and check in with all the plate numbers with staff. You are safe and if you happen to get a ticket, take it back to the business and they will take care of it. I was good, no ticket and I worried all day about it for nothing! You just never know with downtown parking!
Check in - go in and fill out the paperwork and wait! It is NOT a spa so there is not a lot of room to relax at all but you can scan all the bottled remedies and vitamins they have there. The gal at the front desk today was super friendly. If you are early like I was, check in and go for a walk. There is a ton of places to go for coffee, food, etc.
Insurance - All the massage ladies are licensed and registered but are NOT recognized by Sunlife or Manulife. At least they tell you this going in. I had no problem with $65 an hour for a great foot reflexology session!
Massage  - you are collected from the front room and given a loose top and bottoms to wear in your room. The therapist will come in and you give yourself over! Lots of bending, chopping, some pain and anticipation of such pain but I needed a good working over so, it was great! Felt really good after, kept me wanting more time so of course I will go back. I do not think Calgary offers any other place like this!
The oils they use did not take off my fresh pedicure from just a few days ago either which was a plus! 
The room smells fantastic of health - liniment and oils. The room is dim, spacious and comfortable with low music.
No small talk , no chit chat, no warning of what is to come and no explanation of what they are doing to you. Yes, there was a language barrier but I was not coming in for small talk anyways.
When time is up, they leave, you change, pay at the front, grab the green tea they will prep for you if you would like one and you are out!
The massage started and ended on time and I felt the time was managed well for what I booked. 
The guy coming out before me booked a 2 HOUR massage and honestly, that would be a great way to go as the time flies!
The therapists are all from Thailand and made for a great, authentic experience!"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"Very expensive here for what you get on your plate.
If you have been to Texas before and have had REAL BBQ, this place pales in comparison but we were in the area and I had heard U Gotta Eat here had just done a taping at this restaurant. So it has to be good, right? 
Walked in a little after 5pm and there were only 2 other occupied tables. Got a booth at the top which is a really cute little area past the open kitchen. This place was clean and I liked the casual atmosphere and the lovely aromas coming from the cooking area. I like open kitchen style.
Service - lackluster. They lose a point here. The waitress would barely answer your question and flit off to wherever. It's not like she was busy.
We were counting on the food to be a hit. Not so impressed. :(
I ordered a rack of ribs so I could bring half home and I was really excited about the sides including the corn bread. The corn bread is said to be made daily. Not sure about that - it was underwhelming and cold. Would it be too much for them to warm it up a bit if they boast that they take the time to make it fresh? The rack of ribs was the smallest I had ever seen. Seriously, half of what you would get at Tony Romas, just to compare. I forget to mention to the waitress that I wanted baby back ribs and I got the defaulted St Louis Style (I was not asked either which I wanted). Fattier and NOT fall of the bone tender. I just wanted to cry! The bourbon maple sauce it came with was good but I had to ask for extra and the ribs do not come all nice and gooey and saucy. 
Also on the plate was a tiny potion of beans and coleslaw. Both not bad. The beans had a hint of spice to them which I liked and the coleslaw was decent. 
My chosen side was the mashed potatoes. I asked the waitress if the potatoes were real mashed or packaged prior to ordering and she stated that they were real, homemade with some added fluff filler. WTF? What does that mean? OK, I will bite, I got them. NOT real potatoes, I do not care what anyone said and they were not fooling me by dumping the oversalted gravy on top of them!
Ladies and Gentlemen, while this may sound like a heap of food, it was so not, it was ridiculous!
My husband got the 2 meat option which included a very small portion of brisket and a tiny smoked chicken breast. He was done eating in about 10 minutes or less. Sad. His ordered side was the burgoo soup - spicy, flavourful and warm. 
The woman seated next to me long after we had finished eating had the baby back ribs and I could overhear her saying that they were fall off the bone tender. I could not help that I felt that I had got ripped off. The waitress knew it was our first experience there, why would she not have made it the best meal possible for the same price to us? Why, to save the restaurant a few bucks on the crappier ribs?
$70 for a below average meal for 2 people. Plus tip which we cringed to give her. We could have gone for Pho 4 times for that amount of cash. Live and learn, not likely to return."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"Ohhhh Rico! Are you single?
Alas, I am not but I felt like I was cheating a bit as your cooking won me over and tugged at my heartstrings!

This place was recommended to us by a couple of people. My husband is Spanish and we love tapas style dining. I have gotten wayyy better at sharing my food as this new genre of food has made its way into so many communities!

Wed night - we did not have a reservation (recommended to have one esp. on weekends) but the 4 of us were seated upstairs in this house converted into a restaurant. (there is parking to the rear)  It was said that the house is the 2nd oldest in Airdrie! The decor was simple with Latin influence and I liked the paint colors up and down in the different rooms. On the upper level there are 2 separate spaces that would accommodate private parties of 6-8 people nicely. The Spanish music really made the atmosphere, it was wonderful.

Now for the good part - the FOOD! WOW! We each chose a tapas plate and vowed we would all share fairly. The plates are staggered so that you get the plates at different times. The chef is made aware of how fast or slow a particular table is to gauge food delivery!

We ordered a bottle of Chilean red wine (they were out of 'Fat Bastard' our company's first choice), white wine and Estrella beer from Barcelona. All good!

Soup of the day was a potato and corm chowder, really good.
Baby roasted Potatoes with a lovely dipping sauce.
Chorizo and Sirloin skewers - needed 2 orders for 4 people. Worth it! Steak was cooked med.rare, chorizo very good quality.
Portobello mushroom, stuffed. Served nice and hot, beautifully done.
Stuffed jumbo shrimp (my choice!) OMG, stuffed with jalapeno and goat cheese. MMM
Pulled pork on crostinis. Melt in your mouth excellent!
Dessert Trio which are said to come from a local bakery. The white cheesecake was my fave!
Everything was well seasoned!

The sauces that are served with the dishes are mind blowing. 
TIP Make sure you try the green peppercorn one if you can! They need to bottle that stuff up for sale!

I wanted to order the mussels and was told it was the one thing they did not have tonight. 
TIP for you mussel lovers - they come in on Thursdays so they are nice and fresh for the busy weekends.

Alex was a great waiter and raved about all items on the menu - kudos to him for going up and down those stairs all night delivering the food and drink.

We had the pleasure of meeting the Red Seal chef/owner Rico himself just before dessert. He is a wonderfully humble guy, French trained and has used his techniques to make his South American food sing. Rico is from Chile and it is obvious that he is proud of this fact and the food he puts out. He works long days getting up early to go and hand pick his veggies and meats for the day.
I could absolutely connect with this food on so many levels. I loved the space and the ambiance and we had a wonderful time with our friends. 
I want to go back ASAP to try the mussels, crab cakes and chicken and bacon skewers.

A real gem of a restaurant in Airdrie and I could not think of a reason why this restaurant should get any less than 5 stars. We were impressed!"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"Yes... a 2 star for such a nice place... it cannot be helped in our case! In short, the service wrecked the experience for us.
We had been asked to give one of the ""Redwater"" chains another go by management at Redwater for a terribly grey, no-char at all steak we received at our table one night awhile back. We agreed to return weeks later and decided on a location somewhat close to home - the Stonehill. Actually a friend had said something nice about this place, that we had to try it esp. because we lived out this way now. OK, so we figured if we came here and loved it, it was be easy-peasy to come back maybe even once a week and adopt as a fave!
Halt!
We arrived and the outer building first impression IS nice. We were greeted inside with a sign and no hostess stating that the bottom section is closed and to find our way up to the Tavern and seat ourselves. OK, fine. But please, someone sweep the stairs! Found our way to the top, grabbed our own menus and found a booth. The inside of the place is quite lovely, I adore the wine vault that comes up the 2 storeys in the openness and the fireplace. The wood contrasts the stone stylishly. However, I did not think each and every booth needed 2 TVs in such a nice place but.... again the real killer of the meal was the service. A gal who was not lovin' her job, did not want to be there, was curt and did not want to talk about the menu at all even though it was our first visit!
M was happy that Steamwhistle was on sale, he had that and I observed the martini menu! Over the course of dinner, I had 2 martinis that were just ok.
For an appy, we let the waitress pick us a half pound of wings that were on special for $3.99. Not bad - we were given sesame ginger ones, not bad at all and we did enjoy the dill ranch dipping sauce. The chicken wing portions themselves were nothing crazy special and even though some were tiny-tiny, we would get them again on special.
Next up - 2 steaks. I like mine rare, hubby med-rare. Both came out rare (no biggy). When asked by a passing by manager how out first bites were, I hated to tell her that my mashed potatoes were stone cold. I had to try and eat around them and by the time the side order of spuds arrived, I was all but done my meal. Never saw her again. (no free drink, ice cream...)  I did love the beets that I chose as one of my sides (LOVE beets and never like prepping them at home due to the mess!) and the steak was some better than the one M ordered at Redwater some time ago. At least it had sear marks! My only complaint was that my steak was very sinewy and it was hard to cut through all that.
Checked out the dessert menu and decided just to call it a night. We had had a wonderful evening together - just when our server was NOT around. She was a black cloud with her overall attitude. She then brought us the bill and it was the one for the drunken slobs outside on the patio - no, no thanks, not paying their Mega booze bill, we are done.
Out to the car we went that apparently was near the drunken tables self appointed smoking area so our new car reeked to high heaven of cigarette smoke.
Home please - we would not come back unless someone else suggested it."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"This restaurant was on our must-try-list mainly as it is Italian, in the north end and we had read some great things about it. It surpassed many of our expectations for a chain, fell short in some areas but I think we may come back to try another time.
We arrived, had reservations on a Wed night. The hostess was washing the front windows - too bad care was taken to the carpets however. It was the first thing I noted upon entering - the carpets were dirty and in need of vacuuming. The place was much larger than I had envisioned though, neat space with a lounge and even a private little room off the front dining area. I liked the tone of the menu and how it educated one in many parts of it about Pacinis, its values, specials for groups of 8, gluten-free menu, lunch menu. This was problematic though as it was just too thick and long, it was like reading a US Cheesecake Factory menu. The choices were good, varied and pricey. I had wondered how the kitchen could execute every dish well with so much to choose from.
A bus boy in view of myself behind some shelving was blowing his nose and then handled the little water glasses onto guest tables without washing his hands. Gross. Then I noted with a passing glance our hostess filling her face with bread in the kitchen. The staff seems young, def. could use some lessons in sanitation.
The bread bar was cool. You choose your slice of bread and butter and then throw it onto the grill yourself. Included with your meal price and you can go up as many times as you would like. I had never seen this before.
The beer and wine choices we liked. Both white wine and beer could have been chilled more though.
It scared the hell out of me when out of nowhere the Birthday Music came on, blaring. Anyone that has been here before will know what I mean! Literally, you have to stop whatever it is you are doing and no one can be heard over that music. It does go away though, eventually, until the next birthday table celebration.
We ordered the fettuccine carbonara and while the noodles  were cooked very well and there was lots of meat in it, the Alfredo sauce was glopped on, looked like it had come straight from a jar. Thick and bland. A never-again dish. I later asked the server if she knew if it came from a jar and her response was that she had no idea.
I had the Lasagna De La Casa which was ok... the ridged noodles told me immediately it was not made in house, and I could imagine a hundred lasagnas like mine made in mass quantity on an assembly line. Not much love in the dish but the portion size was good and filled the hole for a hot meal. It had veg and sausage on it which was a cool twist. There are 4 lasagnas to choose from and it seemed to be a popular choice. I would try the pizza next time perhaps. I would have tried the veal but each dish was over $30.
Our server was just OK. No complaints, nothing memorable either as she did not go out of her way to make our experience the best it could be.
We left full enough with leftovers in tow.
Not going to rush back but everyone will have their own take on this unique restaurant by the airport, with a patio, attached to a hotel. (Acclaim Hotel)
4 damn blaring birthday songs have scared the crap out of me as I sit here and write this!"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"We were craving a good, homemade pizza in the NW, not too far from home and Matador is what we came up with via an on line search. A self-admitted mom and pop restaurant, this place was built in 1976 and takes pride in staying the way it was and what it is meant to be. It specializes in pizza and steak and the owner will no undoubtedly come to your table and tell you that they are famous for: 
Caesar Salad
Steaks
Pizza 
Lasagna
The menu is wide and varied and had a decent drink list. My hubby's beer was served super cold just the way he likes it and our water glasses never went dry. Service was good throughout and welcoming. Wow, they have fried zucchini sticks here! They have seemingly gone by the way-side since my University days and I wish they were not so hard to find these days. I saw some come out on other tables and they looked fantastic! Next time...
We opted for 2 small pizzas - a veggie deluxe (the pineapple in addition to all the veg on it makes it deluxe) and a bullfighter which has veg and a ton of meat on it for the carnivore in our family.
It was tough not to get just 1 pizza to share and a lasagna but we will save ordering that lasagna as well for another time, as there will be one! The pizza, made with fresh dough was very good. No thin crust here however, it was light and flaky, almost as good as the best buttery pastry you have ever had! The toppings were fresh and I was so glad to see fresh mushrooms on pizza for a change - canned is a sin! I would have liked more sauce on my pizza but that is personal choice. I did ask for some on the side and sadly, it came cold right out of the fridge but we ate it. Next time I will ask for it warmed up. It was like an addictive, well seasoned tomato paste. Interesting and served the pizza well. 
The restaurant was not too busy on a Sunday night, the music not too loud and I really liked the dimly lit ambiance. It is a really nice place and the pics on line did not do the place justice. That said, you would be just as accepted here in capris and t-shirt than you would a nice dress. It is that kind of place, come as you are. I wish the tables had had linen napkins, the paper ones could have been eliminated but, that could be just our opinion.
There is a bar attached with some video poker games and some tables.
Matador was well-kept, clean and again, very inviting. We appreciated the owner sharing with us points about the restaurant and some of its history.
LOVE the fact that this place is open until 3AM every night. PERFECT for a night-owl like me! I want to try everything on the menu!

*Been back a few more times since this review - still just for the pizza which I still feel needs more sauce. Next time, I will ask them to make it extra saucy on the pie and see what the up charge is for that. The last time we went there last week, we ordered a half Hawaiian, half Deluxe Veg med. pizza. I understand totally that they would charge the $4 extra overall for the more expensive pie but to charge $2 MORE to make a half and half pizza because it is hard on the kitchen? C'mon! All that does is takes the server's tip from 20% to 15% as something has to give. I hope they can change this double-dip policy for the customers' sake or I will not be able to recommend this place to friends when they ask where to go for amazing pizza.*"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"New to Calgary, this is actually our second time at Stampede ever. We have yet to make it in to see a Rodeo (not pining to do so but everyone else seems to love them) and we refuse to go into Cowboys tent as that just looks like a yahoo-mess with people over-indulging in pretty much everything. We love to walk around these things, take in the one man bands walking around, check out the buildings, animals, temp. casino set-up and the FOOD STANDS. One can find everything edible on a stick these days here. Watching people trying to bite into the Turkey Legs are a hoot too. We are childless so no rides for us. My hubby is a self admitted wimp and while I have been on many a roller coaster in my younger days, I have no need any longer to trust my life to some rubber band, crazy glue bound, creaking piece of machinery. Watching people zip line through the air above the Fair as I call it was kind of cool. Many of the workers in their little stalls on the pre-opening day looked kinda tired and frazzled at the same time knowing that they have 10 more days of this nightmare working 16 hours per day. Many were from Ontario, the ones we met and spoke to.
The Fair is expensive. We played a couple of games and they average about $4-$5 a game per person. That is a lot for a 25 cents stuffed snake that will end up in a garbage bag in your basement with all the other ones. Crown and Anchor has even gone up to a $2 bet minimum! Remember guys when it was 25 cents to place a bet on Spades? Food, $$$, small corndogs $5, candy apple $4.75, popcorn $4. I have a friend in town who brought her husband and 3 little girls to Stampede. They are going to take it in almost daily and they are all geared up in new cowboy wear. I cannot imagine the cost AND staying in a downtown hotel for 2 weeks on their very modest salaries! YIKES!
We are not much for crowds so it was nice to go on the Sneak Peek Day (Jul 5) with free passes someone gave us to see the grounds. They were set up pretty much like last year. We tried just about every junk food there was, just a bite or 2 each, but we drew the line at the deep fried cheesecake. We do not follow the Fair agenda, do not see the shows, we just like to walk around and around and people watch - and again, EAT!
The traffic is bonkers so if you can avoid driving downtown to get there - do so. Even if you have to take a cab - let someone else deal with the madness.
Overall, the Fair brings back childhood memories, sights, sounds, smells and we may go back one more time before it ends. We do not dress like people/the cowboys we are not but hey - I bought a hat and good thing I did as the rain pelted down last night pretty hard sending everyone for cover and shutting down the Fair. The Fireworks at 11pm were a nice touch as a Fair opener.
I think the main thing is if everyone could just control their alcohol intake, the place would be a little happier and safer place to be. Drunks are just so annoying.
See ya there maybe but not anywhere near the beer gardens - like Cowboys, not our thing but I guess the money has to be made somewhere. Beer - just a simple Budweiser can = $6.75 plus tip. Reeeeediculous. Robbery.
The Fair though is very clean, there are always people sweeping and picking up garbage. It is mind blowing how many volunteers are working the Fair and we are very grateful for them making our experience a better one."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"We were craving Mexican food and authentic Mexican at that so after shopping at Chinook we opted to go down the road a bit to Los Mariachis. We had 2 recommendations under our belt from friends that had been here before and we had been wanting to pop in here for months.
We walked in and had to seat ourselves, only one other couple were present in the restaurant. We had no idea that they closed at 10pm on a Sat night but the staff was gracious and welcomed us once seated. The place was cheerful, colourful and very Mexican themed! Supposedly there is a singer on weekends that goes around to the tables but we missed her tonight. I asked, but the place is simply too small for a Mariachi Band.
I asked some questions regarding the menu (which were sticky by the way - ew)  and I stressed that I would love an authentic experience. The woman who served us is part owner, the wife of this family business and I thought that was just terrific. I was advised that all the staff were Mexican and that we would love the food, however -many of ingredients that they would use in Mexico for their cooking was absent in Canada so it could not be exactly replicated. Bummer. I noted that the prices were pretty steep but was willing to pay for good food that we could seemingly not just find anywhere.
To start we got a beer and I ordered the Sangria. It was pretty good! At $7 a glass and the drink being gone in 2.3 seconds due to its size and all the ice in it, I opted for a glass of red wine. This was pretty decent as well, Australian ""Little Penguin"". I had been hoping for a Spanish wine but oh well. I had been craving soft tacos so I ordered this dish with a side of sour cream. 6 soft tacos come on the plate but they are very small. (chorizo, shredded beef and steak) Still satisfying but not at all spicy (I should have asked for spicy). Hubby got the better meal of El Cuatro which consisted of 4 different types of enchilada type baked tacos covered in different sauces. The cilantro, onion and 2 salsas (green and red) on the side were wonderful additions but again, not hot enough for me!. I love fresh cilantro. 
The food had come out very quickly, I would say in under 10 minutes it all arrived at our table. All of a sudden while we were eating the music went off and the cooks were leaving out the side door! This was our indication that the place was shutting down. CRAP, I had not even touched my wine yet. So much for a relaxed, enjoyable experience! They could have at least left the tunes on!?? We finished quickly and paid the bill. Our server was so nice but she should make note of coming by mid-meal to see how the guests are liking their food - she did not on this occasion. Nor were any glasses of water offered, we had to ask. Service was lacking a bit in this regard and it was almost too laid back, the service. I did not even get a glance of what this place had in terms of dessert ot after-dinner drinks. Oh, by the way, when I had asked what the signature drink was, I was given the response of ""Beer!"" So if you are looking for a deelish margarita, you may be better off at the Keg. A shame!
The food was decent, my stomach is not really sure at this moment what I have done to it but I am hoping for the best.
I would return if others suggested it and wanted to come here but for the prices here and just OK fare, I would opt to try somewhere else in the area where restaurants are in abundance."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"I have a little daytimer book with all of the Calgary restaurants written in it on the last page that I want to try. Model Milk was on that list. It is now off that list, X`d off.

In short if you do not want to read my winded review, stick to drinks and appies if you choose to come here!

Model Milk Brisket, seen on a previous Yelp review was the deciding factor in us coming here tonight to try that but alas, was not a part of the offerings tonight.

When you pull up to the restaurant, you will know from the awesome little white cowhead up high on the store front. Parking was easy, right out on the street. 

Going in was a neat experience - dim lighting, lots of floors to look up at but it is a bit awkward as noone is ever standing there to greet guests. The hostess stand is actually 1 floor up.

The feel and decor of the restaurant is a 5 out of 5 and once seated, we were elated to find out what was to come next. It started off very promising and it had been some time that I was this excited about a new eatery. 

Our server was barely a pass as far as restaurant knowledge, food knowledge, speed of service and problem solving. Service was a 2 star..

Our drinks were very good. Cold, good booze.beer quality. Love the presentation with the mixed drinks - the delicious tonic for EX comes in a mini milk bottle. Anything presentation wise here is highly thought of - to me. I felt like I was in a fancy, exquisite milk carton, in this space with differing ceiling elevations, floors, exposed brick and uber cool, up to the second light fixtures that mixed perfectly with the barn board. I loved up top the open kitchen. The place is a lot larger than what you would think from the outside!

For appies we ordered the cheese and chive fries for $8. Typical fries with herbs and lightly dusted with manchego cheese. It was good, nice sized portion. Then for $13 we got the dungeness crab rolls. Miniscule portions of crab on homemade mini-toasts. Crab is my fave protein and the serving was so tiny I would not have known it was dungeness. The taste was completely marred by the buttery toast and not worth the money.

Mains - this is where is really goes downhill. Between appies and mains - the timing was way off, like over an hour wait between courses...not pleasing. 
Hubby ordered a burger and while we both love salt, his burger patty tasted like a salt lick. Absolutely horrible and he could not eat even half of it. We are not people to waste food but this was inedible. The salad served with it was OK but his mouth was so coated with salt he would not eat it. I am still guzzling water hours later from my 2 bites of it.

My halibut - $33. Uninspiring, under-seasoned, bland but edible. I am not a fan of poached-style fish and I wish I had known this was the cooking method when I ordered it. This thin slice of fish needed to be seared, seasoned and served with lemon. I would never order that again nor would I recommend. I had cayenne pepper and a mini tobasco believe it or not in my purse or else I would have had to send that dish back. BLAND.
This is not one of`those restaurants that has salt, pepper, any condiments on the table.  But, it should.
Food - 1 star.

As soon as we mentioned the issues with the burger, our waitress should have gone to fetch a manager. We only spoke to one as we were paying the bill who did apologize for our experience and did take the burger off the bill. No incentive offered to us to come back and try again. Not even a free dessert offer.

Hard to go from a 5 star evening to a 2! Will not return."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"We had wanted to dine at Famoso but there was a half hour wait and we were starving. Walked up the road a bit and voila, there was Earl's with no wait time and I had an Earl's gift card burning a hole in my pocket.

I liked that there was a hostess at the ready for us to get us seated. The lounge was packed and very loud so we opted for the dining room and there was a table ready for us right away. Too bad we were seated next to the screaming, crying baby in the room. I would argue that this restaurant is NOT for children/babies.

Overall, the food here was pretty good. The service - not so much.
We ordered a caesar salad to start and the waitress was kind enough to have that split into 2 plates for us. The salads here are huge. The caesar is - well, boring. No bacon and it does not come with any lemon to jazz it up. Had to ask for the lemon and ground pepper. We had asked the waitress how the baby calamari was upon ordering and she said it was pretty good. We agreed that the salads would be plenty with our full meals and that next time, we would try the calamari. Wouldn't you know it, the calamari was brought to our table anyways with our salad. Hmmm. We mentioned to our server that we did not order it and she advised that as long as we did not touch it she would bring it back to the kitchen and implied that it would be re-served to someone else. Really? I would not want that happening to me so we told told her that we would just keep it, thanks. Error #1.

I ordered a 7 oz steak that came with a really nice whisky sauce and some button mushrooms over top. The veg was a couple of cut up roasted red pepper pieces and purple onion. They could have used a little imagination for a $26 plate and used asparagus. I did enjoy the meat, it was cooked rare, to order and I loved the mashed potatoes too. I would be hard pressed though call these garlic mashed as were described on the menu. Too bad. I love garlic and there was not a hint of it in there. I finished my drink and ordered another - which NEVER came. Error 2.
No waters were ever poured for us either throughout the whole meal, none offered.
By the way I ordered my first Earl's Bellini as my first drink and I really liked it. Very peachy, very summery and cold.

Hubby ordered his usual hamburger with cheese (extra charge of course for cheese) yam fries (extra change of course) and for dipping, on the plate was a really nice curry- mango sauce. Inventive, we both liked that and the fries were killer yummy. I took half my meal to go as the unexpected calamari kind of filled me up and dessert never even crossed our minds, we were so full. Not that we were offered any - the server approached us and advised that she was off shift and could we settle our bill? I guess so, sure. She advised that one of her colleagues would be checking on us as she scooted on out of there but that never happened.

Service fell down tonight, was not on point, the server was in lala land and there was just no efficiency whatsoever.

I felt that the food was good enough that the review warranted 3 stars but maybe that is too kind. I am in a generous mood today. I guess I was in a generous mood last night too as despite all all server's flaws, she still made her 15%. But she was standing right there as I entered the tip into the machine too so - what else could I do?  

I doubt we would ever make a point to come back here - too bad. They could do much better business if they would step up their game a bit and do some staff training. I can see by the other reviews as well that this place is struggling to keep its lackluster overall 3 stars."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"We had been excited to try! Finally got to on a Friday night with resos.
It was quite busy when we arrived and had to wait at the front door for at least 20 min for our table. A little awkward as there is nowhere really to stand while you wait.  
The restaurant itself is quite nice and when we finally were seated, we were glad to be more in the interior, up on the second level. We waited another 20 min at least for our server to come by even just to fill our water glasses. He so obviously had been on break. It happens, but we found him to be flip, curt and not super helpful about the menu when he was at our table.
The service for Vintage almost downgraded the stars to a 3 overall but wow, the food here was good and made up for it. We were glad for the choice of coming here in the end.
We started with the Caesar salad which I have to tell you maybe have been the best of its kind I have ever had. Double smoked bacon, crisp, cool lettuce/lemon wedge with just the right amount of dressing and not too many croutons. Perfect. And large.
We also got the escargot which comes in a brown gravy sauce in a little ramekin with brioche for dipping.  This too was very good. Rich but delicious. 
We also got little sourdough rolls on the table, complimentary. You could tell these were ""end of the night rolls"" but they were the perfect size and the sourdough  taste really came through. They would have been a 5/5 had they been warmer and fresher.
We of course came here for steak. The 10oz Prime Rib starts at $29 and if you want any other type of steak it jumps to $44. Not having an expense account of any kind for this evening's dinner, we each went with the Prime Rib. Med Rare is the rarest we could have it so that was our choosing.
The sides... YUM. I love how you can pick a side to go with your meal here. Not like other places where all those are separate from the meat.
We opted for the asparagus and the onion rings. Oh, the onion rings, thanks to another reviewer here on Yelp that raved about them, THANK YOU x 1000! They were so good, quite possibly THE best onion rings I have ever had. Huge, well seasoned and crispy. 6 to an order and the asparagus was well cooked and plentiful too for sharing.
The Prime Rib served in its own jus cut through like butter and we were happy with all of our choices. We for sure had leftovers.
We had a beer and glass of wine respectively and no complaints about these offerings. 
The music playing was - odd to say the least. No top 40 here, no classic rock, I am not sure what it was. But, we were happy to see a band was setting up for live music.
Our server seemingly wanted to get out of there so he packed up our food to go, did not ask us about dessert and proceeded to bring us the bill. The credit machine automatically asks you for a 20% gratuity to be given even for 2 people. 
Ya, not deserved tonight.
We were meeting friends below for a drink in the lounge after dinner. 
WOW, you go down the stairs and into another world. From fine dining to a meet/meat market!
The band was great and it appears that every Fri they have someone new playing. I thought from what I read on line that they played Jazz here Fri nights but this is no longer so!
 We would perhaps come back here for a delicious dinner and give the service another go but may try another lounge afterwards for a different, less obvious hook-up scene.
DEF:
Meet market or meat market, is an originally pejorative term referring to two related phenomena:
a location or activity in which people are viewed as commodities and
a business like a nightclub where people typically look for a casual sex partner."
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"What an evening! My husband arrived home in time from work for me to whip on a t-shirt and jeans as we had an errand to run where we live in Bridgeland. Low and behold on the way home, we passed Dolce Vita AGAIN and wondered what it was all about. We always crane our necks to look inside up and down and around but can never see in! A couple of nights I took the time to look up the reviews on this place and the news wasn't that good. So, we have lived in this hood for about 4 months and have avoided it. We thought we would step inside tonight on the way by and have a peek in. We were warmly greeted and invited to go check out the new 2nd level ""pizza bar"". (LDV) It has only been open for 1 month. OK, I thought I could have been dressed better to sit downstairs anyways and I wasn't, so upstairs we merrily went. PLEASANTLY surprised. The upper level is warm and inviting and by the time we left (we got there early around 530pm) it was at full capacity. (Many X-mas parties) The upper area is nothing at all like the lower area where it appeared dark and unwelcoming. But I could be wrong about the main level, we did not venture in down there too far... So, we were greeted by a new waitress and kind of seated ourselves by the window and menus were brought to us. Fireplace roaring, the place was fresh and clean and I was surrounded by manly black chairs but warm wood and fixtures. I loved the beams in the ceiling. My husband got to try out a new beer tonight which he loved from Austria (Stiegl) and he was even given the option to sample first! He wanted to try one other but the Keg was out, no biggie. I tried a Chianti red wine to start and it was lovely. Mozzarella balls (fried) on the appy list was not missed by my husband (a mouse in his former life according to him).I KNEW these would have to be ordered. The waitress advised we should have the focaccia bread with it to add to it but, not my fave so we skipped that but ordered the balls to come out with our pizza. The balls were large (2), fresh tasting and nicely breaded. A great score. The pizza - thin crust, Napolitana style, wow, you can see that huge oven as soon as you walk in. THIS is pizza I have been looking for in Calgary, fresh ingredients, good selection. We ordered the San Francesco style pizza which has a trufflle oil base, arugula, prosciutto, asiago cheese and grape tomatoes. ($16) YUM! No guilt! It was like a salad on barely there carbs! The pizza was not overloaded with the pricey toppings but was just enough. We loved having the mozza ball sauce, nice and tomatoe-y to dip the pizza in. I really could not believe how many beer they had there but my husband ordered a second Stiegl and I ordered a red wine,  valpolicella. Very nice, even more body than the first one and went well with food as the waitress had in fact mentioned. She could not comment too much on the food as she was so new - this is why I believe anyone starting in a new restaurant as a server should have a scheduled tasting of everything. But, that is my opinion - we were on our own to order and we did well. We had a great time. This spot had a true Italian feel to it and I felt like I had been transported back a bit in time to another place. Not cheap but not overpriced and no frills EX, no candies come with your bill at the end!  We have to commend our server though, as true foodies, we took our time with everything and she was ever present and gets an A for effort. The bill without tip was $63 including GST for 2 drinks each, a shared appy and shared pizza. We looked at the dessert menu but we will save that for another time. (No tiramisu!?) And there will be another time, very soon!"
is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,"Can I give 6 stars? This was the single best dining experience we have had in Calgary since we moved here. I am still thinking about the experience, the people we met there (staff) and the FOOD, wow!

Hubby had a brilliant last minute idea of a date night this past Wed morning. We had been wanting to go to Charcut for awhile and he was able to get a table by booking on line for the same day which was surprising! 

We met downtown and inside we went! I love when there is a hostess actually standing AT the hostess stand and the amazing service started here! The hostess took my hubby's jacket and we were seated at table 63 where I was metres from the open style kitchen. My husband, knowing I am a huge foodie, Food Network fan AND Top Chef fan said, ""Yep, there she is!"" I looked up and there was Connie with a smile on her face waving to us! I managed to keep my composure, yes, I was a little star struck and sat myself down properly in our little booth and did not hit the floor as my heart did stop for a mili-second! We had about 5 waiters come to our table throughout the night and I just loved feeling like we were appreciated customers!

The night started off with a choice of natural or sparkling water - nice touch, and I did not see the sparkling water added at all to our bill. This is not a place we found that nickels and dimes the customer. The restaurant works together in all areas to make sure you have a wicked overall experience! 

Connie HERSELF brought us a stunning plate of thinly sliced cured meats and fish crocettes to start. HOW NICE! She must have talked to us for 15 min, wondering what our story was and telling us how she was doing as I had 40 questions! None of the Top Chef fame has gone to her head whatsoever. She is personable, down to earth and really added to our dining experience! That gift plate from the kitchen was very special. Next up, we ordered the heirloom beet plate. I am so glad they had this for me to try as the menu changes DAILY and you just never know what they will add/take off the menu. The beets and greens were to die for and everything was seasoned beautifully and the greens were not overdressed. YUM! 

Moving on, we had the infamous duck fat poutine as we just HAD TO and I am so glad we did. The portion size was large! Just perfect for 2 people, a poutine unlike I have ever had before. Perfection from the still-crispy fries, to the LARGE pieces of curds to that gravy that made the dish. 

Then we ordered the steak which was served on a cool cutting board complete with the large steak knife sticking out of it. On the board also was my pasta dish that was covered in sumptuous baby clams and BACON! We were somehow able to eat almost everything with the promise to myself that the next day I would not eat ANYTHING to make up for it, haha! The steak was seasoned perfectly. I can see how some may say that the meats are salty here but I love, love, love how they prepped everything. I know if I come back here, the food will be consistent and just as great. 

The restaurant is a roasthouse whose mission statement is just evolving simple ingredients. I love this point of view. The restaurant also focuses on family style eating so being a whole bunch of people with you, you will be well taken care of and you will leave full! 

Our water glasses were always kept full and I was impressed with the wine list. I had 2 glasses of an incredible Malbec that made my meal sing even more! Speaking of lists, I appreciated the fact that the menu was not a 100 page book. One simple sheet, front and back is all that is needed. You know then that the ingredients will be fresh and the chefs get very good at the dishes that they do prep.

Not dessert people normally but we had to round the meal out with something sweet, right? We had a choice of 3 things - we opted for the blueberry cheesecake which came in a little mason jar. So original and so deelish! Connie brought this out to us herself and also on the dessert plate laid 2 still-warm chocolate chip cookies like grandma would make! :) Congratulations was written in chocolate on our white plate as she had heard that we were recently married. :) Sweet! Connie works very hard, only taking Sunday off. She is even present for lunches and there is a very cool place for people to sit and watch the chefs in action at the kitchen bar. I will be going to lunch here as I am dying to try some other menu items and the soup that they serve mid-day.

The restaurant is hip, urban but not at all pretentious. Everyone makes you feel at home, including Connie's husband Jean-Francois who seems like such a nice guy! I was lucky enough to be able to chat with him too!

Everything here just seems to run so smoothly and the staff nails the little things for the meal which I feel is so important.

I could go on and on but I won't - other than to say that we found the prices so reasonable for what we got that we will be back here on a monthly basis.

5 huge, shiny stars."
BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Walking around in the late hours in Koreatown we struggled to find Lim Ga Ne. Until we realized, that is, that this was a new spot; a reincarnation of its former self on Euclid. And it was only after sitting down that my dining companion remembered her previous experience and it was a mess: bland food and impossible-to-deal-with service. The new Bloor street version apparently looked better, but not by much.

Like a lot of restaurants in K-town the decor is ""rustic."" Peach coloured walls creeping with 1980s wood panelling, laminate floors and washrooms that score a six on a scale of dungeon to dynamite. There were two LCDs blaring Korean TV, and I'm somewhat grateful I couldn't understand the goings on. Weird stuff.

As we arrived, the staff was munching away at a table. They inexplicably pointed our party of two toward a table for six, but that's not a bad thing. We were promptly served the requisite water in plastic jug and given the menu: a photo-grid place mat of their various offerings: pork rib ($10), sellung tang ($8), dduk kook ($8), soondae ($8) and several meaty platters meant for two that started at $30. I had a hankering for dolsot bibimbap ($10) but it was described as vegetables, sprouts and noodles. I asked if I could get mine with meat, and my server just repeated the word. Meat. When I tried to specify pork or beef, she just said ""meat"" and nodded.  I had no idea what I was getting.

The sizzling bowl arrived, and the 'meat' was there as promised. Ground up grey stuff that neither looked nor tasted appetizing. Being spoiled by spots like BCD and SAS, I have to say it: this was a fail. The bibimbap was heavy on the sprouts and devoid of flavour. I was killing it with Sriacha, and I barely got a third through before I gave up. (This is rare; normally I force bibimbap down with the ferocity of livestock attacking feed.)

My DC's meal (beef brisket in a spicy broth) was much better received, so perhaps stone bowls aren't their speciality. For me however, this place was definitely a disappointment.

Obligatory Title Pun: This place has it's LIM-itations.

Menu Readability: I do enjoy me a photo-grid place mat.

Need to mention: A solid selection of banchan was served, but even the kimchi was a let down.

What this place teaches me about myself: If you're gonna bring the sizzle you gotta bring the steak. Or in this case, the 'meat.'"
BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"With a name that screams ""hey, meatball,"" lovers of ground up animals would be hard pressed to resist this new spot in Little Italy. This space was formerly a drug store (excuse me, a convenience store that sold contraband) so the transformation is a welcome change: cool grey walls, bright red chairs, slick artwork, a curving marble-topped bar, and a wide open (and I mean wiiiide open) kitchen preparing meats in balled up form.

Heading straight to the back we were greeted by the gregarious owner Rodney. I was drooling as he man-handled tubs of ground beef and pork. Chewing the fat with Rodney, it's clear that restauranting is in his blood. He grew up in restaurants as a kid, and there is a hobby horse in the corner where his little daughter bides her time, hoping one day to inherit the proverbial meat torch. The emphasis here is on local foods, and when they eventually add beer to the menu there sure to be local brews.

The vibe is casual. Rodney would curtly ask customers ""having a sammich?"" as they tried to figure out the menu. Another example: after ordering he asked if we wanted anything to drink. We looked around for options but there weren't any posted. ""Ginger ale?"" There was an ""uh, sure"" kind of moment but we agreed, figuring that was all they had. When he dropped two glasses of house-made soda with generous chunks of fresh ginger floating in the bottom, I couldn't have been more surprised. Talk about under-promising and over-delivering.

Food! The menu is a chalkboard the size of bedsheet, but really only features 2-3 options writ large. I got the penne and meatballs and my DC went for the meatballs on a crispy chibatta bun. My huge plate of pasta was served with a tiny piece of bread, but it's not like I was wanting for food. There was a lot of flavour to the sauce and the meatballs were off the hook. They were the perfect consistency: easy to pull apart and not overcooked, but not overly crumbly either. 

They're no debit or credit yet, so bring cash. Once they're tapped up this will be a can't miss spot. Can't wait to see what else they have in store. 

Obligatory Title Pun: ROLL on by and have a BALL.

Menu Readability: You'd have to visually impaired to miss it.

Need to mention: A soft-serve ice cream machine portends great things.

What this place teaches me about myself: Ginger ale is palatable when it's made with real ginger."
BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Six-thirty was kind of early for a dinner reservation I thought, but Marben is a fairly popular restaurant. As we checked our coats at the door I couldn't help but notice empty booths and tables in the seating area. ""Good thing we made a reservation,"" I chuckled to myself. When we followed the hostess down some stairs I was confused. Hearing a table full of my friends yell 'surprise' cleared up the matter immediately. How do I keep falling for stuff like this?

Anyway, I visited Marben for the first time on Saturday night and what a night it was. Marben is in a rather weird part of town on that disjointed strip of Wellington St near Portland. Taking a cab seemed like the most sensible option. Once we got their we were treated to a beautiful space. Lots of natural wood, healthy noise level and fairly casual. We were seated downstairs (in the Bavette room) which is a cave-like space with a dedicated bar, dim incandescent lighting, and dark corners. Great place for a party.

Our server was charming and waxed enthusiastic about the menu. As an alternative to ordering à la carte, she offered to have the kitchen assail us with ""a bit of everything"" from the menu. While we recognized the risk of such a proposition, it seemed like a logical choice for a group of about twenty. In hindsight, it was the only choice. A brilliant move.

After inquiring about food allergies and preferences, our server disappeared to load the food cannon. We ate a lot. 

They brought out charcuterie boards, fresh oysters, fish cakes, duck fat fries, a crispy sea bass, roasted sunchokes (these were killer), roasted brussels sprouts and buttery gnocchi, generous carvings of their amazing burger, a sausage made of like six different meats, broccoli tempura, spaetzle, slabs of juicy beef, and there was a salad in there somewhere (which I obviously avoided). I was impressed with every bite. Everyone was talking about the smoky beef tongue on the charcuterie board, and the burger was maybe-the-best I've had in the city.

Fabulous dinner.

Obligatory Title Pun: Get 100% of your MARB-ohydrate intake.

Menu Readability: I didn't have it for very long, but I remember good leading and lots of rounded sans-serif.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Just for fun, let's pretend that you, gentle reader, have never set foot inside a Walmart Supercentre. Let me set the scene. 

Since we're obviously in the 'burbs you must first manoeuvre your SUV or minivan into a parking lot that can only be measured in football fields. After acquiring a spot nowhere near the store, get out of your car and see if you can feel the gravitational tug of the small-business-crushing blackhole that is Walmart. As you make way through the no-doubt-strewn-with-blue-shopping-carts parking lot, remember: this isn't even close to the worst of it.

The action starts right away. In fact, I've never entered a Walmart without someone else simultaneously leaving. It's an endless loop of consumption: coming, going, buying, breaking, dawdling, vacuously staring, slowly dying. Think maggots on a decaying steak. Be prepared for sobbing children. You might be greeted by a man or woman in a blue vest who you will avoid but still want to embrace and tell them it's OK. You will be unable to get any help in the store. This is normal.

Once you have crossed the 20-foot long, three lane vestibule that is the antechamber to savings, you will have entered the no frills fluorescence that is Walmart. At a Supercentre you need only *ponder* a saleable item (a towel, a toaster, skis, a pear, eye drops, a step stool, a USB hot chocolate stirrer) and as God as my witness: it will be manifest. It will also  be of middling quality and priced so competitively you'll think you're at a garage sale, but you'll probably find it.

It would be foolish to attempt to distinguish this Walmart from others, and I shall not. A few positives (aside from their Olympic selection and human-rights-defying prices), are their sensible approach to the express queue (bank style), and their generous return and exchange policy.

Negatives include: their detrimental effect on small businesses in a community, their mostly-imported low quality merchandise, and the People of Walmart themselves. The POW effect is less pronounced in Canada than the US, but trust me, it's there.

In summary, if you can get it at Walmart, you can get it anywhere else. I recommend you do.

Obligatory Title Pun: All in all, it's just another brick in the WAL.

Menu Readability: Geez, even their logo is cheap.

Need to mention: Avoid any and every location in the month of December (or any time of year really).

What this place teaches me about myself: Not a damn thing."
BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Since my visit to NOPA in San Francisco, I've been dying to find a spot with a similar vibe in Toronto. I think I've found it. About halfway up the Ossington strip is the umlautted Böhmer restaurant. A former garage turned fine resto, it's spartan and stunning. Concrete floors, beautiful wood candeliers, touches of green vines in wine bottle sconces, all in a gorgeous cavernous space. Touches like the coat rack behind the host's desk are impressive in their simplicity. A communal table the length of a limousine bisects the dining hall, and I really dig how spaced out the tables are. It's loud in here, and I like that. My kind of atmosphere.

The menu is Napoleonic: short and impressive. In fact, the food options are easily dwarfed by their wines and cocktails. I started off with a Ginger Julep (Bombay and ginger liqueur) with fresh ginger and mint. Yes! So good. They also make their own water here. You heard me correctly. You'll be charged for an initial serving of bubbly or still water (if you want it), and it's unlimited thereafter. It tastes nice, but I'm not really sure how they ""make"" it.

Our meals were pretty damn good. We started off with a trio of tartares: venison, scallop, and salmon. The venison (topped with a quail egg) was tender and flavorful. The seafood was served in the passionfruit hulls. I'll admit the the salmon was so-so, but the scallop with it's marrow-like texture was buttery and smooth.

Mains were equally impressive. I scored the chicken fricasee which was gently fried chicken in savoury jus served with the most amazing mushrooms I have ever tasted. My DCs had the arctic char and roast duck. The char had a deep flavour to it, as though poached in brine, and the duck was meaty and rich -- almost like steak.

It was pretty much a flawless dinner experience. If I had to pick on one thing it was the mewling manner of service. Our server was more than bit cloying in his affectations: ""I would like to bring some more water to your table, if that is all right with you,"" followed by some awkward wrist movements. It was weird, but whatever.

Yeah, it's pricy, but I can't wait to go back.

Obligatory Title Pun: The BOH-ld is so beautiful.

Menu Readability: Short, simple and to the point.

Need to mention: They have a cocktail ""named after the winning 1856 democratic ticket James Buchanan and John C. Brechenridge."" Yep.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"You'd think two elite yelpers like Steph C and I would know to check the hours on Yelp before setting off for dinner. Sheesh. After standing outside our first -- and closed -- choice with our jaws agape and our eyes slightly misty (dust or something) we quickly regained our resolve and marched down Ossington in search of dinner.

As luck would have it, neither of us had been to Union. Located on the west side of Ossington just south of Delux, it's a few steps up into this charming space. There is a bar right at the front, which acts as a host's table and I spotted an espresso machine here also. Behind this miniature cafe is the restaurant proper. It's long and filled with tables. There is a marble bar at the back that encircles the kitchen, giving you a great view of the action.

When we requested a table for two our host sucked air between his teeth and frowned slightly. The restaurant was virtually empty. After perusing the reservations list carefully, he offered us either ""the worst seat in the house"" (my attribution, not his) or a spot at the bar. Easy choice. Long story short, they'll like you better if you have a reservation. 

That said, the service was fairly solid. No fewer than three staff members reminded us that it was Talk it Over Tuesday, which meant we could grab a bottle of Gewurtztraminer (or any wine) for half price. And thought it did eventually get busy (who can resist half-price vino?) we never felt rushed or doted upon.

The foods on the menu are all locally sourced and a chalk-written list of their sources is visible in the kitchen. Even without reading all the reviews, both Steph and I gravitated towards the elk sliders. It's a meatball-sized morsel of elk on top of toasted challah crowned with a  pickle. And as others have noted, they are pretty phenomenal.

My habenero glazed pork chop served with roast asparagus and yellow zucchini was cooked perfectly (pork chops can somtimes come out really dry) and the portion size was decent. Steph got the Union Burger which looked like a winner also. I can't wait to come back, which thanks to their check-in offer, will be to collect a free appetizer at lunch. Score!

Obligatory Title Pun: Don't secede from these UNION.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"It was my friend Jane J's birthday on the weekend, and she refused to tell any of the guests what we were doing. When we pulled up to her place, our only instructions were to follow behind her, and try to keep up (she drives fast). We wound our way through the no-man's-land between Etobicoke and Mississauga until we ended up in the parking lot of a drab-looking building in an industrial park. The sign read eZone. ""Oh,"" I said to myself, ""we're going to an afternoon rave. Good thing I brought some crank.""

I was wrong. The eZone is a 30,000 ""multi-dimensional sports and entertainment complex"" that caters to kids and adults alike. They feature an arcade, billiards, a basketball court, cosmic bowling and Whirlyball. For those not up on their cart-sport hybrids, Whirlyball is a combination of bumper cars, lacrosse and jai alai. You drive bumper cars around a small rink chasing a whiffle ball with scoops -- which you then toss towards something like a basketball net. If this sounds like madness, it is, but it's a helluva lot of fun. More than an afternoon rave, even.

Unfortunately, they are a bit disorganized here. Our host had arranged for laser tag following the Whirlyball, but apparently we had been double-booked with troupe of snot-nosed and surely undeserving kids. (I'm an adult, damnit. I finished UNIVERSITY.) Our guide grumbled something about ""not being paid enough to deal with"" this nonsense and set us up with some more Whirlyball instead, which we followed up with a rousing game of dodge-ball in the basketball court. I can't say I didn't have fun, so it was a net positive experience for me. I might have felt differently if I was footing the bill for this shindig however. IMHO management should have gone above and beyond to make this up to us. (Free drinks? Cosmic bowling? Handies?)

All in all it was an enjoyable group event. Though the facilities can be so-so (some carts are fussy, and the balls and scoops are super fragile), you'll quickly lose yourself with all the fun you're having. Seems perfect for a corporate gathering or birthday party for the little kid inside you.

Obligatory Title Pun: Get in thE ZONE.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"I finally got to sit down at the Woodlot. I tried on several occasions to just stroll in and eat but failed every time. (Me! Vivek! I know, right?) Now normally, I would say Eff this Ess and throw my hands in the air like a princess and possibly even leave a flaming surprise on their front steps, but I didn't. I just heard too many good things and was determined to sup here. I made a reservation.

Even on a Tuesday night, the Woodlot was bumping. We rolled in at 21:00 for a 21:15 reservation and by some luck we were seated right away. As we walked upstairs I took in the glorious decor. It's simultanously open concept and split level, with high ceilings, a bar and communal dining table on the main floor, and a proper dining room (that seats about 30) on the mezzanine. The dining room was delicately lit, decorated with native art and had the perfect rumbling for a date. I believe this sound level is most accurately measured in Sexy Decibels (SdBs).

Right off the bat we were offered the choice of vegetarian or normal (you heard veg-heads, bring it) menus. Beatrice Y nails it when she says that vegetarians can legitimately dine here without the indignity of having to work around standard meat-filled options. Some of the options on vegetarian menu were downright tempting, but I knew exactly what I wanted. 

The ox tongue terrine with fig jam was a brilliant start. Not too salty, very tender and pretty enjoyable spread onto their house-baked bread. We eagerly moved on to our mains. My DC ordered a wild boar papardelle and I manned up to the chicken and ham hock pie. Both were motherflipping incredible. I have been comparing every papardelle I have had since to the Woodlot's version with its tender noodles and slathered in that delicious boar ragu. And the chicken and ham hock pie (besides being fun to say; try it) was incredimous. It just had this palpable homemade quality that is hard to describe. It was good trust me.

If there was a low-point in my evening it's that my sazerac wasn't perfect, but seeing that typed out makes me feel like a douchebag. Simply put: the Woodlot is a fantastic choice for an intimate dinner, prepared with excellence and without pretension. I like it.

Obligatory Title Pun: I'm getting a LOT of WOOD just thinking about it.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"This literally cool café in Yorkville was a delight on Toronto's first scorching summer day. Located just south of Davenport on Avenue Rd, Seven Grams is just enough off the beaten path. It's a sleek and modern split-level coffeeshop with plenty of seating and great coffee. 

As you enter a trio of egg-shaped orange chairs greets you as if you say, ""we are a trio of egg-shaped orange chairs"". This orange motif is repeated along the stair risers leading to the coffee bar, and ultimately culminates in the bright tiled wall behind the counter. Chic is the word for this interesting space.

On this top level is where you'll find espresso, pre-made sandwiches, and pastries (by none other than Circles and Squares). There are an array of weird coffee-making contraptions about; on my visit a jumble of wood and glass tubes were tacitly working in concert to fill a white bowl with drip coffee. This counter-top science project was a cold press, i.e., yet another way to extract flavour from coffee beans. (But do we really need anymore?)

I ordered an iced latte and a bagel and cream cheese. The only seating upstairs was a communal table filled with Mactards, so I trekked down into the empty and wonderfully frigid lower level.

The floors downstairs resemble terrazzo, though I think it might be polished concrete. The room is bounded with wood benches adorned with pillows. Not the most comfortable, but there was plenty of other seating down here too. With a much lower ceiling than the 2nd floor, the entire basement is lit like a gallery: the ceiling-mounted halogen bulbs highlighting the art on the walls. And a fair bit of natural light from the front gets down here as well. It's definitely cold down here, but it seems they have anticipated the winter, as a wall-mounted fireplace sits ready for service. (With a sign indicating ""Do Not Touch"". Seriously, fellas.)

My one complaint is a nerdy one: not enough outlets for the aforementioned Mactards. By which I mean virtually none, and thus I had to leave after an hour. But there is free Wifi. Just ask for the password.

Over all Seven Grams is a remarkably cutting-edge space with great service. (My bagel literally arrived on a platter.) Oh, and they make a mean latte too. I'll be sure to try a proper espresso next time.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Like a lot of Canadians, I don't really trust banks. They are generally smarmy institutions that spout condescending messaging like ""you're richer than you think"" (pfft), and are always working on ways to get at your moola, ruin your marriage, and/or destroy the world. (I think I'm paranoid...)

Which is why the Network Orange / ING Direct Café (across from the Eaton Centre) is an interesting experiment. Despite all appearances this spot isn't a bank. They do have a couple of ABMs and the staff will field some questions if you happen to be a customer but there is nothing here you can't do at home via online banking.

Instead, this place is touted as a space to hang out, grab a coffee, use some free Wifi and chill. It's a large space, though seating isn't abundant or that conducive to work. It is pretty though: they have soft leather couches, and a bar covered with iPads if you want to browse. There is lots of light and natural light, a garden wall, and copious amounts of orange if you're into that sort of thing. I'd recommend the street-facing bar if you brought your own laptop, and there is a single booth IF you get to it first.

It's not a typical coffeeshop. For starters, there is no cash register so you can only pay with debit or credit. There is no counter so just look for someone wearing an orange shirt. The coffee is supplied by Merchants of Green Coffee (bonus!), and there are pastries by LPK's Culinary Groove.  Also unique about this spot: 100% of the proceeds from sales go to a charitable organization. On my visit it was the Canadian Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund.

On the second floor are collaborative spaces available for a fee. Presumably this is how they afford their rent at Yonge and Shuter. You can rent seminar rooms, their projector and screen and other presentation tools. I will likely never use this space, but it is a cool idea.

Considering I am the only non-staff member here on a Sunday afternoon it remains to be seen how this café-by-a-bank will fare. It's certainly just as corporate as the Starbucks across the street, but has better coffee and the proceeds go to charity. Advantage: Orange.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"My obsession with cocktails has reached a juniper-soaked fever pitch. Just the other day I scraped together unused egg whites from breakfast to fashion an early afternoon bourbon flip. Totally unnecessary. So too are the infused simple syrups I make in my spare time. And I think I buy way more fresh limes and lemons than is typical of a person without scurvy. I think I have a problem, but I can't seem to SHAKE it.

So I took some classes. Located in a rather non-descript location at Adelaide and Portland, the Toronto Institute of Bartending is the place to get edified in the ways of the drink. Their ""classroom"" is a fully-equiped bar where you pull up a stool and get your learn on. Their bartender certification program includes lessons in product knowledge, tastings (Sippin' Patron at 11am? Yep.), and of course many hours behind the bar, mixing, shaking and stirring. 

TIB was quick to emphasize that this class is about bartending -- not mixology. You don't only learn how to make drinks but how to serve and treat customers. This is definitely crucial stuff for anyone wanting to break into the industry. There was good practical advice about how awesome working in a nightclub is (spoiler alert: it's not), and helpful tips on how and where to find gainful employment as a barkeep.

Our instructor was Chris, a long-time tender of bar at various Toronto haunts. He really knew his stuff and kept the lessons casual and breezy. He wasn't afraid to tell the two unfortunate lovers of Smirnoff Ice in our class to ""GTFO"" (something I truly appreciate) and he blasted music during our practical work. He's also quite man-pretty which I just thought I'd mention for the ladies (and curious men) out there.

The course was spread over four eight-hour Saturdays; well worth the cost considering the knowledge and skills attained. On the last day there is a practical and written test, and if you pass you get certified. I'm not above mentioning that I was the top-scoring dude on the practical exam. I ""won"" the honour of doing a ""muff dive"" shot in front of the entire class. I'll be sure to post the video of this online never.

Lots of fun. Check it out.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Khao San Road is HOT in every sense of the word: it looks stunning, it's packed to the gills and it's mighty toasty in there. 

We almost walked by -- there is virtually no signage out front. The restaurant itself is a low-ceilinged space with dark black floors, modern furnishings, and bright haloten lighting. When crowded, there is a significant din and lively energy about the place.

Our host suggested a 30 minute wait when we entered but the lean and hungry couple ahead of us in line warned that they had been waiting over an hour. Looking around at the frenetic servers and bottles of wine on the tables we decided to put on our Patience Caps. Nearly an hour later were we sharing a sizable table with a trio of strangers and ready to order right away.

We started with the squash chips ($5) which are puffy crisps the size and shape of melted iPhones[1] (but thinner obvs) served with a tamarind sauce. These were tasty, but dangerously filling, so I backed off after eating about 98% of the basket. My DC ordered the Khao Soi ($13) a coconut curry garnished with crispy onions. 

The server was adamant she get the beef over the chicken; a good call. The beef was super tender and flavourful. Predictable me: I ordered the Special Pad Thai ($14) over the street style. It seemed like a no brainer to me: it comes with more stuff up to and including peanuts. I would definitely consider this one of the top variations of this dish I have had in the city. The chicken was PERFECTLY cooked and it was actually spicy. Yum! The servings were really sizable, and they win bonus points for providing plastic (over Styrofoam) takeout containers.

It has to be said that KSR is not equipped (psychologically or logistically) to handle their recent onslaught of attention. The servers were racing from the kitchen to tables, avoiding the eyes of any patrons that would distract them from their immediate goals. We spent most of the meal without place settings and my DC's Thai Ice Tea (a super sweet cold drink) took ages (and asking three different people) to fulfill. I'm not going to be too hard on them because they are just getting used to this dramatic surge in business and the food really does make up for it. It was a long wait, but we were all smiles after our meals.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Nuit Blanche has become too popular. 

Before you brand me an anti-populist hipster, hear me out. In the years since Nuit Blanche first hit Toronto, our fair citizens (and the organizers) have forgotten that it is actually an exhibition of modern art. You know, that stuff that sits around collecting dust in galleries and museums that people tend to ignore most of the year? Nuit Blanche is supposed to be That Same Stuff presented in a new an exciting way: by turning the city into an open air interactive art gallery and at night. At night! How radical.

But really it's just a drunken stampede. During Nuit Blanche the streets are noisy and teeming with people trying to get their art on. And I hope it doesn't sound like I'm wearing a monocle and smoking a pipe as I write this: but that's not what art is about.

Sure, I like the notion of taking esoteric pieces and making them public and accessible and free, but as the time goes on Nuit Blanche has turned their focus on spectacle. I remember years ago, I was walking down a quiet street in Alexandra Park and came upon an ordinary house, illuminated from the inside with mysterious silhouettes dancing in the windows. There was some ethereal music too. It was subtle and interesting. This year, people were zip-lining across City Hall. I didn't go because I heard the queue was enormous. Line ups? For art? Forget turning the city into an art gallery, this is like Canada's Wonderland.

The litany of disappointing exhibits you hear about is inevitable. Art doesn't have an immediate and recognizable ""payoff."" It's something to be experienced -- like a meal, not a snack -- and unfortunately I think the din and spectacle of Nuit Blanche makes it a terrible environment to experience art. Let me repeat that for the art lovers like myself: Nuit Blanche is a terrible environment to experience art.

It's still fun to walk around and check out the spectacle. I enjoyed seeing The Darcys play ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" over and over and over again at Toronto Underground Cinema, and the Heart Machine at Bay and Elm was definitely grandiose and appealed to my inner pyro. I thought it was a bit Burning Man-esque, and sure enough it was there last year. Don't get me wrong, I think a lot of the exhibits are cool. It's just the crowd and crowds that are getting me down.

This is an event with the potential to show people really extraordinary pieces of art and have them appreciate it in a really unique way. I guess Nuit Blanche succeeds on the former point, but in the latter it fails.

Now to go polish my monocle."
BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"We arrived on a Friday night around 10pm, after other options for a late-night snack proved fruitless. There's not a lot of eats in this district, so I was happy to hear the clamour of diners when I stepped inside. Me and my DC grabbed a two-top. 

The dining hall is black and white and Oliver and Bonacini-ish -- those monstro upside-down tin buckets acting as lamps are cool -- but it was loud and the vibe was not right. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it just felt wrong. When the waiter came to take our drink orders, I panicked, pulled a L____,[*] and asked if we could sit in the lounge instead. My DC looked at me like I was crazy.

But what a difference scenery makes. It was subdued and relaxing in the lounge and much better decorated too. Wide plank herringbone floors? Awesome. We grabbed a seat at the long bar and ordered some Ahi tuna lettuce wraps and some veal sliders from their bar menu. The trio of sliders were served with exactly 13 ""house-made crisps."" The chipotle mayo on the burgers was tangy, but the veal was a bit dry for my liking. The lettuce wraps (five on the plate) were a creative idea (soy-dipped tuna, avocado and these crispy things on top) but I would have preferred the avocado to be less soft; it made the entire thing kind of goopy and wet.

I washed down the snacks with their Manhattan with vanilla-infused Wiser's. It was interesting but I wasn't feeling the vanilla. The bartender confessed it was an extract (""using real beans is a mess"") but I don't know if that would have helped.

So overall this was an A-OK experience with execution a little off the mark. Nothing particularly offensive about my visit, but my socks were not knocked from their standard positions. Am I expecting too much from O&B? (Pauses to inspect bill... $60 for nibbles and a single cocktail). Maybe not.

[*] Let me tell you about my ex. Basically she was a _very_ picky dining companion. We have left restaurants because it was too bright inside, or too dim, or because a server waved us to a table instead of accompanying us to a seat, or because of the menu length (too long/too short), etc. We'd often get up seconds after sitting down to the bewilderment of staff. I got so accustomed to this, that in my own mind I dubbed it ""Pulling a L____."" There you go."
BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"First things first: Barque is pronounced 'bark.' Think dogs, trees, or tri-masted sailing vessels. It's not 'bar-kew' (like barbeque missing a syllable), though either way it doesn't matter. Your mouth will be too full of juicy meatstuffs to care about simple things like pronunciation.

Barque's warm and inviting decor was a stark and pleasant contrast to the wet, grey evening upon which we arrived. It's bright and bubbling with noise inside, and there is wood everywhere. (Like, there was literally a pile of logs on a nearby shelf.) We sat down at a long table near the back of the house, and were welcomed with two pails of seasoned popcorn resting on the table top.

There are a selection of appetizers under $10, a pair of salads (Caesar and spinach), and eight solid-looking sides. Cutting to the chase: I'd recommend one of the samplers as the path of meat resistance. For $20 you pick three from four meaty options and get two sides. For $36 you get a higher quantity of meat (still three of four) and three sides. 

I opted for the roast chicken thigh, Kansas-style baby-back ribs, and the brisket. Those are in ascending order of yum and yum they all were. Chicken was cooked perfectly but not too much else to say. The ribs are not of the fall-off-the-bone variety, and this works in their favour. Great texture and flavour without being slimy. The brisket came as super tender and mouth-watering slices. I'd love to try this on a bun or jump into a bathtub full of it. That good. My Caesar Salad was topped with candied bacon (GOOD) though I would have preferred more dressing. The Cuban Corn is 1/3 of a cob; it was a nice touch but next time I'm trying the pickled platter. 

Service was pleasant, though I think our waitress was just learning the ropes. She had to ask who ordered what, which led to a confusing debacle at the table. That's an easy one to fix.

Chef and co-owner David Neinstein stopped by after to see how the meal was. He wasn't just fishing for compliments either, he really wanted to know what we thought and seemed determined to get things perfect. I gotta respect anyone who seeks feedback like that. Classy dude.

Great prices, a hospitable atmosphere, and a respectable showing for my first time out. After I recover from the meat sweats, I shall return.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Before I tell you what happened, let me explain that I think that The Pie Shack is a truly amazing spot. We spent no less than 3 hours here on Saturday night, eating pie, playing cards, drinking coffee, eating pie, playing around on our laptops and eating pie and loving almost every minute of it. 

After all, there is a lot to love. The decor is fantastic: simultanously antique-y and modern and cosy with long communal tables that invite conversation (and board games!) with others. The music is spot-on. The service is exceptional: Tim the owner was friendly cubed -- when we walked in it almost felt like we had walked a family living room for an evening with friends.

And the pies? Killer. It was dinner time so I tried a savoury chicken pot pie and FOR REAL it was the best chicken pot pie I have ever had. Not soupy, but firm, flaky, and seasoned beautifully. Later we tried some apples 'n' sour cream and bumbleberry pies a la mode. They have a wide selection of teas here, and the coffee I had was fantastic. I must have had three cups.

This place was seriously rolling on a six star rating until something happened that well, kind of ruined it.

The table behind us was reserved for a birthday party. When they arrived, the owner was scrambling to find chairs. That's when we came over to me and my date as we frittered away on our laptops. ""Hey do you guys mind..."" and he kind trailed off. Obviously he needed some chairs, and I was happy to move. But there weren't really any other spots available. That's when he reminded us ""that it's saturday night and it would really help him out..."" Dot. Dot. Dot. I was flabbergasted. He was asking us to leave. This was particularly distressing because 1) there were two free chairs at the table we were sharing with another couple and 2) and I couldn't imagine that 2-3 people from the large party would break away to a new table and assume the spots we were meant to vacate.

In the end the large party seated themselves just fine so we didn't have to leave, but being asked to was embarrasing and made us feel really awkward and unwelcome. Considering the stellar service up to that point, I'd chalk it up to the stress of the large party clouding the owner's judgment.

Everything positive I said about the place stands. This place is a gem, and I'd love to come back and have a flawless experience and give them five stars. Until next time.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Every food court has that one spot where businesses never seem to thrive. At the VBTG food court it's deep in the back where once stood a Fiesta India and before that Island Foods. Perhaps things will bode better for the newest entrant to this haunted corner, Est West Cafe.

It's pretty fancy-dancy for a food court. I noticed a high-end meat slicer in their spacious kitchen, stacked stone on the walls, lots of halogen lighting, and staff outfitted with HIGHLY RIDICULOUS pink uniforms. Just go see.

Food-wise, it's hard to tell what's going on here. There are backlit menus and wipeboard signs everywhere promising breakfast goods like eggs and bagels, but also steam trays with noodles and pan-asian combos, and the aforementioned meat slicer, and quiche(?) -- it's a bit of a Charlie Foxtrot in here. After staring blankly for a few minutes (at the pink uniforms), the guy behind the counter suggested I hit the beef teriyaki which comes with free salad. ""Salad"" he explained constitutes anything in the steam trays, which is a very wide selection indeed.

Or maybe he said ""everything"" in the steam trays. As another chap put my order together, I chose some shanghai noodles with my teriyaki on rice. ""Anything else?"" he asked. I grabbed a chopped mango salad. He looked at me expectantly. ""Uh, some sprouts..."" I was getting a little weirded out but I already paid, and I guess maybe you were allowed a few options. ""Anything else?"" he said again. All right, I'll play this game. ""Some kimchi?"" Sure. ""Tofu?"" Why not? I can keep going. ""Vermicelli?"" My eyes widened, and I had to surrender.

When I brought it back to my table, it was almost standard human birthweight, and the kid even snuck in some rice balls when I wasn't looking, as if to say ""I'M THE BAUSE"". Presentation-wise, it was the worst thing I had ever seen. I might as well have agitated the combo like a Shakeweight. The taste? It's hard to say. The beef teriyaki was good, but other items were misses. The tofu was so-so, ditto the noodles. Really enjoyed the sprouts though, and I'm a sucker for kimchi in any configuration. Plus it was just so much stuff, that it was hard to discern real flavours. Maybe that's my fault.

It will probably require a few visits to get a handle on their vast array of options, but I will return.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"It's a heck of a view from the 360 restaurant. While I don't think it is the highest restaurant in the world anymore (that's in Dubai), it's certainly the tallest view of this city. The entire outer edge of the restaurant completes a full revolution in a brisk 72 minutes (and why people are determined to test this is beyond me). This gives you a wide vista of the lake, Toronto Island, and the downtown core.

As a non-tourist to Toronto -- and therefore not effervescently soaking in every wonderous facet of the tower -- I found getting here a little annoying. There is a green-screen photobooth on ground level (which we sprinted past) and then a wait at the elevators, and then yet another wait to get into the restaurant; odd considering it's reservations only. It was a relief once we were seated. 

The 360 has the atmosphere of an upscale chain steakhouse. Note that there are some tables NOT situated directly next to windows, and I would feel hosed were I seated there. (Mostly two-tops.) Probably worth clarifying this specifically when making a reservation.

Much has been said about the high-prices here, so I will only chime to agree that yes, the menu is pretty overpriced for what you get. You'll probably end up ordering either the $55 or $68 prix fixe meals, as scanning a la carte pricing might give you vertigo (shrimp and grits: $50?). I opted for the bigger prix fixe.

We started off well. The charcuterie board was served with Kozlik's mustard and had some nice Quebec cheeses. And there was a dill gazpacho served in a shot glass as an amuse bouche. Ooh la la. My entrée (which took a while) was a prime rib with bread pudding. The prime rib was cooked OK, but it wasn't stellar. I can't put my finger on it, but it just wasn't melt-in-your-mouth succulent. The bread pudding is easier to assess: burnt and bitter. It was truly terrible, and I wish I hadn't even taken a bite.

My goat's milk vanilla ice cream for dessert was topped with dulce de leche and caramelized bananas. Not a bad way to end off a meal. By the time we left, the sun had set and downtown had transformed into twinkling lights against the darkness. (Our 7:30pm reservation let us catch the skyline in daylight, and let us enjoy the sunset too.) The atmosphere is definitely enjoyable, but food-wise you're likely to be disappointed.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"There is a strange irony about this place. As you pass through the majestic collonade facing Front St, you enter a truly awe-inspiring atrium with a vaulted ceiling and herringbone marble floors. In this 'Great Hall' is the ticket counter for VIA Rail, a Harveys fast-food restaurant, and a looming arrivals/departure board that makes you feel like you're truly in the Centre of It All.

But all the action takes place underground -- where the ceilings are low, the air is stale and the design borders on the 'municipal'. Nearly 100,000 bodies are shuffled around every day in this underground space, and it's a shame that they have to walk underneath the grandeur and not through it.

A few tips for the uninitiated. When arriving at Union Station you can access VIA Rail (inter-provincial transit), GO Transit (inter-city) and the TTC (light rail and subway). GO buses are located on the other side of Bay Street and can be accessed via an overpass. There are taxi cabs parked out front (on Front St), but more than likely one of the forms of transit can take you where you need to go. You can also access Toronto's underground PATH (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/path-underground-toronto), a network of tunnels which can take you as far North as Queen St and the Eaton Centre. Be warned, taking the PATH won't supply the most efficient route, but it is certainly a warmer route in the winter.

Your food options in Union Station are very limited. The Harvey's in the Great Hall is the least fast foodish of your options. If you can wait, get yourself to one block north to King Street where there are a tonne of restos close together.

While this isn't the easiest train station to navigate, nothing is impossible to find or too far away. The ticket staff are never too busy (except for the first day of the month when people are buying commuter passes) and will usually help you plan your route or find a platform. And for the busiest station in Canada -- there is a decided lack of squalor and sketchiness here. Though parts of it are homely, I find it a comfort to be here. But maybe that's because it reminds me so strongly which city I live in, and how lucky I am for it.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"All right ladies, keep it down. It's time for a MAN to deliver his two cents on this Lawrence Park nail salon. Or at least, someone fairly close to a man. A man-boy really. Whatever, shush. I came here for my first mani/pedi experience with a group of fine lady yelpers on a Sunday afternoon, and I was blown away. 

Now, I've seen the inside of a few nail salons in my day and none are quite as shiny and clean as this one. The staff walk around decked in white smocks and wear name tags in Swiss type. It's very Bauhaus. There are eight (8) pedicure stations that look like they cost about a million bucks each, and when I arrived the girls were already getting their soak on. I plopped in and joined these yelpettes.

These are incredible chairs. There are probably 1,000 vibrating massage permutations, though I liked the lower-back one best. As we got pampered we watched a DVD of the Reese Witherspoon classic* ""How Do You Know."" I was secretly hoping for more Girl Talk (i.e., discussions of dreamy man-yelpers, juicy gossip, ""omigawds"" tossed around hither and thither, etc.) but the plasma screen kept us pretty captivated.

There was discussing of me getting lime green toes, but in the end I opted for a clear coat on both my hands and feet. I must say, it was a pretty relaxing experience, and the massages felt nice. Afterwards my fingernails felt very clean and strangely almost lighter. Does that make sense -- nailsense? Now at $35 per service, it's more than I would spend on the regular but a) there is a solid discount for yelpers and b) it definitely feels like a luxury experience. A treat.

A note on the customer service: it's out of this world. This place could be flipping stolen automatic firearms, but their attention to detail shows tremendous respect and care for their customers. An example: the owner gives free manicures to youngsters in the area who perform well in school. I saw a stack of book reports, math tests, and essays slathered in As and A plusses. (I even saw a 103%!) If that isn't incentive for a teenage girl (or sophisticated young lad) to keep up the grades, I don't know what is. I didn't just leave with great nails, I left with the warm fuzzies. (Though I'm sure Reese helped.)

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Opened by the the same folks who helm Table 17, Ascari Enoteca is Leslieville's entry into the Amazing Torontonian Enoteca Race. It's fitting then that it's christened for a famed Italian Formula One champion. The resto features racing iconography and postcards regaling diners of its namesake, Albert Ascari; a man who was as enthusiastic about eating as he was with driving at high speeds, i.e., a Man.

Though it isn't enormous, there are quite a few tables inside which make it well suited for groups large or small. The decor is mostly subtle, modern and grey, which is as far from nonna's design sensibilities as I can imagine. I enjoyed the long bar, where bottles of wines slotted themselves into Tetris-like wall shelves.

Their menu comprises of starters, salads, and pasta. Quite simple. The drinks menu is actually more substantial. They have a handful of inspired cocktails (Fernet-marinated kumquat in a Manhattan? Say what?), some bubbles, and a solid selection of red and white by the bottle or glass. When the description promised the that the Cacc'e Mmite di Lucera ""tasted like purple"" we had to order a bottle of this red. Pretty dark and fruity and a respectable match for the eats.

Our foursome started off with the Antipasto Ciccio which was a platter of meats, cheeses and spreads served on a large charcuterie board. It's quite an array: provolone, quince jam, honey comb, a grape seed mustard, pickled veg, honeyed chestnuts, olives, and three kinds of salami all served with a small basket of soft bread. I thought the meats fell a little flat but everything else was interesting enough, and it was sufficient for four people to share. We also ordered the Crostini alla Toscana: three crostinis topped with a generous dollop of chicken liver mousse, capers and sage. I could eat about a dozen of these bad boys. 

The pasta was flawless.Two-bites-in everyone was thrilled with what was on their plate. I was impressed (with myself) for ordering the casarecce with sausage, tomato sauce, peppers, and fennel. Simple but extremely satisfying, and a Big Boy portion. I also snuck a bite of the other pastas on the table; everything was great.

We polished things off with a three-layered semifreddo of maple, quince, and chamomile and cappuccino. A wonderfully light closer to a fantastic meal. With a bottle of wine, an appetizer and dessert dinner for two came to $120, which is well worth it. I shall return!

It's a wee space that's lousy for groups but perfect for a date; narrow, dim, and buzzing with noise. The kitchen is simply everything you can see behind the bar, a space no wider than a hula hoop. Food is an integral part of the decor: a couple of shiny manual meat slicers are perched on the bartop and massive hunks of cured meat dangle from the ceiling. You can watch the cooks prepare everything (which I did avidly), and it just makes you that much hungrier. 

Strong drinks are key while watching food prep. As long as you like negronis, the cocktail list is decent. They have a few variations of the classic cocktail (one with prosecco, another with soda, etc). I opted for a variation swapping out vermouth for a berry-tea-infused Cointreau. Amidst all the flavours, I can't honestly say I could pick out the berry tea, but I liked it. My date choose a simple aperol sour and it was -- as the ladies sometimes say -- uh-mazing.

A tiny space means a tiny menu. There are a smattering of simple appetizers like sardines and crostini, an olive plate, grilled octopus, and other nibbles. We elected to share grilled pears and soft cheese, served on proscuitto and drizzled with pine nuts and honey. I loved this. A great way to get your appetite going. 

There are even fewer pizza options than apps. Of the four, we went with bison with buffalo mozzarella, thyme and lemon. The square pizza is a decent portion, so with an appetizer it was just enough for the two of us[1]. Was the pizza good? HOT DAMN. It was dotted with savoury bison meatballs and served with a fresh lemon wedge on top. The crust was brilliantly thin and so buttery and rich, I should have reached out and high-fived the chef. (I just thanked him instead.) Such a perfect balance of flavours, with not one ingredient overpowering another. I wholeheartedly agree with Ashleigh G when she says that this place could give the other pizza powers in the city a run for their money.

There is no dessert menu at present, but the chef told me that they might be coming up with something soon. Exciting. If this place is a secret, it won't be for long. Five stars all the way.

[1] My date and I were light-eaters that night. Your mileage may vary."
BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"I visited here with my immediate family and grandparents who are visiting from India. The GPs were immediately taken by the name, wondering what the liberation from samsara and attaining moksha had to do with buffets. ""Canadians throw around these terms carelessly,"" explained my parents.[1] They all snorted in a way that conveyed ""we hope this place doesn't suck"". Tough crowd.

Vedantically accurate or not, Nirvana is a spacious and well-decorated restaurant situated near Hurontario and Highway 401. It seems well-suited for groups; there were round tables that could easily accommodate eight or more people. And it's pretty opulent. There are sculptures and artwork galore. We snagged a circular table for six beneath a chandelier centred in a coffered octagonal ceiling. That's just how I roll.

We got the Executive Lunch Special ($13.99), which is simply malai kofta served in a briefcase. I'm kidding. Actually, the ELS is pitched as a ""buffet at your table""; they bring you three dishes (specify vegetarian or meat), daal, raita (yogurt), a generous basket of naan, yellow rice, and galub jamun for dessert. This is perfect for the sedentary buffet-goer with poor decision-making skills. They just bring you some of their choices (which change frequently apparently), and it doesn't even take that long. Within minutes our table was covered with copper containers. To start there were vegetable fritters and boneless lime-chicken. The green-tinged chicken was a great start to the meal and there was a lot of it. I would recommend you try it with the brown chutney. 

For the mains we got paneer makhni, aloo gobi, curry chicken as well as the aforementioned daal, rice (this was good), and naan. The consensus around the table was that everything was Fine. That's it. The dishes had a perceptible mix of flavours, but it wasn't a sensory explosion and certainly not an out-of-body religious experience. Spicy and mouth-watering this food most definitely was not.

Oh, and the galub jamuns were ovoid which is a dealbreaker for me.

That said, it's a pretty killer deal for a whackload of edibles and the service was very accommodating. I probably won't make a special trip out here, but if I happen to be in this (Godforsaken) portion of the GTA again, I'd stop by, especially with a group.

Obligatory Title Pun: Come as you are/as you were/as an ALOO GOBI.[2]

Menu Readability: I'm sure it's splendid, in that it's leather-bound and all that, but I actually forgot to look. (I was hungry, mkay?)

Need to mention: Even though it's not a buffet (more like a tonne of food at your table) they treat it as such and you cannot box any leftovers. Lame!

What this place teaches me about myself: I could be the brown Weird Al. (Weird Ali?)

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Before we set sail on this review, can I rap about the WC a bit? What is going on? There is some bad art in there, an unclothed baby-doll toy hanging upside-down from the ceiling above the toilet, and one of those godawful sinks with separate faucets for hot and cold water. How do people wash their hands in these things? I seriously want to know. Do you pool a little cold water in one hand and splash it on the other while it's under the hot water spigot? Could someone please send me Ikea-esque pictographic instructions?

Moving on. The Atlantic is a shared-plates diner with a focus on Portuguese fusion and seafood. It's on Dundas West by Lansdowne, and looks a lot better inside than the motley sign outside would suggest. Maybe that's the point. It's a bonny spot that's dimly lit, has tables in every available corner, and is slathered with nautical art. (Insert foghorn noise here.)

I always appreciate when a server asks whether you have been to the restaurant before. We hadn't, and she helped explain what they were about, how much is a reasonable amount for two people to order, and other menu queries. Top marks for service.

Here's what we ordered with my pithy notes:

Bean dip
A generous helping of dip, served with four pieces of toasted bread. This was good and garlicky.

Bass tartare 
I did not like this. The tartare was served on top of some seriously salty greens (might have been Nori, actually). Do not want.

Savoury Tarte flambée
These crispy bad boys were quite enjoyable, but again kind of salty.

Duck confit salad
My fave. It was a tonne of delicious shredded duck, not too fatty, served on endives and radicchio. It disappeared in seconds.

(Another foghorn noise, maybe some seagull squawks.)

Goat cheese gnuddi in saag(!)
It turns out that gnuddi is a like the soft pillowy insides of gnocchi but without the potato-ey jacket. (I never knew this.) I definitely enjoyed the cloud-like texture of these little dumplings but they weren't that interesting. Even in saag.

Creme brulee
I have had better.

Huge brownie
This came from OMG down the street. No complaints.

Espresso
I most definitely did not enjoy my espresso. It was actually a bit gritty.

I'm very torn on what exactly to rate the Atlantic. The restaurant and service is adorable (hanging dolls aside) and the menu is highly ambitious and creative. On the other hand, I didn't dig everything I ate and the total damage came to $70 for two before tax and tip. Kind of pricy. But given that their menu changes frequently, I'd definitely come back to see what else they have in store. Or should I say 'in shore'? Yo, ho, ho!

Obligatory Title Pun: AHOY MATEY. 

Menu Readability: Single-pager pamphlet-sized in a modern font (like Bodoni but not). It's printed daily, and they use quality stock.

Need to mention: They have an array of cocktails starting at $10.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"This place is the real deal. An eye-talian eatery with a NYC aesthetic in an old-school Toronto neighbourhood. I got to sample A LOT of their menu with some wide-eyed foodies last week. Had I eaten even one more bite, authorities would be scraping cheese, sauce and my exploded yelpy innards off their pizza ovens.

Bigabaldi's is walking distance from Glencairn subway station. Like a zebra that owes money to the casa nostra it was black and white and red all over. There are two round tables with tall crimson-topped stools and a street-facing counter with a bit more seating. The floor is a checkboard and white subway tiles covered any surface not painted teal. Very classic looking, but with limited seating you'll probably want your order to go.

Let's talk grub. The owner Rob, started us off with the 'bomba', a fist sized meatball ($4) made of beef and pork that was spiced nicely, wrapped in bread and drizzled with red sauce. Mouth-watering. Next they served up a hero coldcut sandwich the size of a dinner plate and the height of two big macs. It looks like it could feed at least two, which for a $7.50 price tag is a steal. Mortadella, sopressata, proscuitto, ham with mozzarella, sundried tomatoes and mushrooms. I enjoyed this a lot.

Cracking open a Brio, we moved on to the pizza. Their smallest is a twelve inch ""medium"" ($9.50-$14.50) and it scales up to a two-foot wide party size ($19.50-$28.95), whose box alone is intimidating. I tried two of their signature versions. The Bigga is a meat-lover's dream with pepperoni, bacon, mortadella and sausage. As a mortadella fan, I almost cheered when I saw this come out, but I actually preferred the Baldi. It's roasted garlic, rapini, sausage and goat cheese. I don't know what kind of goat cheese they were using here, but it was fantastic. Be warned, the crust here ISN'T thin; so it'll fill you up quickly.

I only had a few bites of their veal sandwich. It has a ways to go if it wants to best other contenders in Toronto, but it wasn't bad. The pepperoni-filled panzerotto ($6.95) was super cheesy, and goes well with their sauce. Not too oily either. The only thing I didn't care for was the arancini ($2.95) which was a bit gooey for my liking. We topped off the night (as if I needed more) with an experimental panzerotto: banana with nutella and rolled in cinnamon and sugar. I'm sure I don't have to explain how good this was.

It's hard not to like this place. Bigabaldi's does quality offerings at very reasonable prices with super generous portions. I can only complain about is how far it is from my house, but it's better for my waistline that I can't come here every day.

Obligatory Title Pun: BIGA is better!

Menu Readability: They didn't mess around on the graphic design here. It's fabulous.

Need to mention: This was a special event, so all the food and drink was provided for free.

What this place teaches me about myself: If I set my mind to it, I could double my weight in six months."
BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"I don't often eat at ""factories"" but I thought I would give this place a shot. The Butter Chicken Factory (more of a restaurant really), is just south of Wellesley on the west side of Parliament street. This corner spot was formerly a Timothy's Tikka House, though I'm not sure what business a man named ""Timothy"" had with a Tikka House anyway. Good riddance.

BCF is fairly cosy inside, but pretty classy and clean. They managed our reservation for twelve by linking a large round table with a couple of four-tops. It worked, but any larger would be pushing it. The Bollywood pop in the background wasn't my favourite, but it beats the plinky-plunk piano music that usually fills joints like this. Beer options are the very typical Kingfisher and brewed-in-Canada-but-Indian Cheetah. They both suck. Don't bother.

As the sole brown diner in our group, I happily provided my menu consulting skills (for free). We calculated that eight dishes should suffice for our group of twelve, but our waiter suggested we try Dinners For Four (DFF); each gets you a selection of appetizers, five entrees, and your choice of rice or naan. It took a bit of haranguing (more than I would have liked, to be honest) to convince the staff that three DFFs (i.e., 12 dishes for 12 willing-to-share yelpers) was enough. Eventually we settled on two dinners for four with a promise to order more if hungry. (Seriously, it went down like this.)

The meal started off with some pretty decent apps. The pakoras were pretty good, and I really dug the potato samosas. A good traditional crust with a dusting of something salty, maybe garam masala. As for our mains we ordered two of their three offerings of butter chicken (boneless and bone-in), a goan fish curry, lamb vindaloo, malai kofta, daal tadka, aloo gobi, channa masala... holy moose it was a lot of food, and it came out fast. The standouts were the bone-in butter chicken (it's always better this way), the creamy malai kofta, and the flavourful lamb vindaloo. Though I could have handled everything a few notches spicier, there was a lot of flavour and nothing was too oily or rich.

At the behest of Avitania ""I want sweet balls in my mouth!"" B we ordered dessert. I got the ras malai (passable, but really thin), and the restaurant was kind enough to comp us some galub jamuns. Honestly: I've had better. These balls were small (tee hee) and a bit dry in the centre; not dripping with sweetness like they should be. But Hell, dessert wasn't anything that could derail a rock-solid dinner that left most of us stuffed to the gills. Group diners take note: 10 dishes feeds 12 and the damage worked out to only $30 per person.

An awesome addition to Cabbagetown.

Obligatory Title Pun: Make yourself KOFTA-ble at the BCF.

Menu Readability: Indian menus are usually way too long and unreadable. Theirs is well laid out.

Need to mention: The naan here is Off The Hook. It's crispy and thin and comes out untouchably hot. I really liked it.

What this place teaches me about myself: My people are not known for their beer-making skills. Sweet balls in syrup on the other hand..."
BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Until Volos Estiatorio, Richmond and York was a pretty sad intersection. There are the rear ends of the Four Seasons Centre and Sheraton Hotel and Little Anthony's, a mostly tourist-oriented Italian spot. The arrival of this new Greek resto, however, will have you smashing their plates with glee. (Please don't actually do this.)

Though I was shamefully underdressed [1] and reservationless to boot, our hostess was kind enough to seat us at the bar while they prepared our table. In the meantime we helped ourselves to some Greek drinks. The cocktail and wine menu takes care to feature Greek spirits and vintages. I am ignorant about Greek wine (I thought only Satyrs drank the stuff), so I ordered a gin cocktail called Eros' Passion, and it was good. Erotically so.

As we sat at the bar a Very Handsome Man (I assume the owner) came over and told us a bit about the the restaurant. Volos is a port city in Greece and Estiatorio means ""restaurant that leans more to the upscale."" The VHM explained their aim of serving Greek food in a dignified way (read: no souvlaki on a bun) while also offering contemporary dishes that allow them to feature local meats and fish.

We started with the Kefalotyri Cheese Saganaki ($11), which was brought to our table and promptly set on fire with brandy. The sheep's milk was soft and creamy, and a bit tart too. Great on olive bread. I liked it a lot. My DC got the moussaka ($19), which I didn't try since I don't eat eggplant, but it got a thumbs up. I ordered the Exohico ($22) which is lamb, spices and vegetables wrapped in phyllo pastry. There is a bit of a story with this one... so sit back weary travelers, and sup at the generous teat of Grecian-food-intake-related tale-telling:

In short: when it was served there was a hole in the side. The waiter told me it was ""banged up a bit"" on delivery but from my eyes it looked edible. They offered to make me another one, but as someone not prone to waste (and let's face it, I'm impatient), I took the damaged portion and they were kind enough to take it off my bill.

But if the kind gesture didn't leave a great taste in my mouth, the exohico certainly did. So full of flavour and the feta and kefalotyri cheese were seriously drool-inducing. And what isn't better wrapped in phyllo? What? What! I ask you?

We shared two scoops of Greek yogurt for dessert. Be warned, it's very tart and way more filling than it looks, but if you spare the room in your stomach it's worth ordering.

All in all I had an excellent experience there. I think it's a perfect spot for theatre-goers or visitors to the nearby hotels. That is to say: please skip The Keg.

Obligatory Title Pun: They aren't friVOLOus about Greek cuisine.

Menu Readability: The same words a woman uses to describe her ideal wedding: elegant, classic, tasteful.

Need to mention: My date mentioned the VHM no less than five times. I'm not joking.

What this place teaches me about myself: It could be equal parts bleach and bongwater -- if it's called Eros' Passion I'm slurping it up.

BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"This location is one of their permanent clinics and one of the swankiest. You get to make your donation on cozy leather recliners, and their multiplicity of stations means really short wait times. Truly my favourite clinic.

I'll write this review for the uninitiated. If you've never given blood before you might be nervous, but the entire process is quite simple and actually painless.

They accept walk-ins but appointments are always preferred. Once you sign in, you take a number and wait a few minutes to have your iron levels tested. This is done by pricking your fingertip and analyzing a slide of your blood in a machine. I find this to be the most annoying part of the process but it's not painful. If your iron levels are high enough (males usually don't have to worry about this but females might) you get to proceed. 

You are then given a booklet to read and a must answer a short questionnaire. Answer the first 13 questions in a private area that resembles a voting booth. It's tempting to blast through these questions, but read them carefully. You might not qualify based on recent travel, some medication you are taking, or ailments you have had in the past.

After this comes ""The Interrogation."" You are taken into a private room, where they take your blood pressure, and ask you personal questions -- including ones about your sexual history. Some people find these questions controversial, but obviously their primary concern is the safety of the blood supply.

And once you've jumped through all these hoops: it's needle time! You get to choose which arm you want, though the phlebotomists are keen to meet your most cooperative veins. There is a sharp feeling when the needle goes in, kind of like stepping on a pebble in your shoe. I'll say this: there are reasons not to donate, but this millisecond of discomfort isn't a good one. Man up, dawg.

Once stabbed, you just lie there for about 5-10 minutes. The needle isn't noticeable and I usually chat with the RNs and other bloodletters. The more water you've had that day the faster the donation, so come hydrated. Five minutes is normal, and they won't let you spend more than twenty minutes in a chair. While some people feel lightheaded after giving (and usually on their first donation) it's actually pretty rare to pass out. Once drained, you will be gently escorted to the kitchen for the big prize: cookies and juice and a thank you from a volunteer. This is the only time in my adult life that I eat those jelly filled Peak Freans, so I savour these post-donation moments.

And that's it from soup to plasma. You can learn more about the blood donation process, including other things you can donate like plasma, platlets or bone marrow on their website.

And just to squeeze one more entreaty to donate: While I can't name a single person who _chooses_ to get seriously sick or in an accident, at least one person reading this review will need blood one day. Lend them yours.

Obligatory Title Pun: I like the way you work it/BAG it up.

What this place teaches me about myself: This might be my probably my only opportunity to save a life."
BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"Customer service would seem to be the hamartia of Café la Gaffe. Me and my DC wandered in around 7:30pm for dinner. Their front patio was full, but I learned they have a Smoke Free Back Patio which are probably four of my favourite words in the english language. 

We were led to the back (pointed, really) along is a route that takes you through the narrow restaurant, past the kitchen, through a ramshackle corridor and finally on to the secluded garden patio. They actually manage to cram in quite a few tables considering the modest size of the space. The partial roof means plenty of shade and they have a gas heater for colder nights. It's a lovely spot.

A few moments after sitting down, our server politely asked us to move from our table (which was at the end of a row of two tops pushed together) to a separate table for two since they often get busy during dinner. This is an understandable position, but if they are particular about this they could have seated us properly, instead of waving us toward the back of the restaurant.

Anyway, we were famished so we got set to order. There was a full page of specials as well as a road-map sized menu. There were a lot of compelling selections. I chose the penne with beef, sausage served in rose sauce, and a starter of mussels in a Thai-inspired curry broth after I saw a girl furiously devouring these on the way in.

The portion sizes are generous and this is not helped by the fact that  our meals were really, freaking, good. The mussels' broth was brimming with awesome flavours, and I couldn't help sopping it all up with bread. It would have made a killer soup all on its own. The penne was just loaded with delicious stuff: spicy sausage, mushrooms, and slices of tender steak. My bowl of pasta was enough for two servings and I ate pretty much the entire thing. 

Foodwise, I had no complaints but getting served was another story. They are dangerously understaffed, or at least, disorganized. Our server was managing both the front patio and the back patio (and no doubt getting flagged down in between), which made her visits painfully infrequent. It took more almost half an hour after we finished eating to procure our cheque. I noted by the receipt that it had been printed ages before we finally got it, but clearly she hadn't had a chance to bring it our way. We waited another 25 minutes with the credit card sitting on the table before I hunted her down myself. When she conceded that ""she hadn't been back there in a while"" like the back patio was a college bar or the neighbourhood she grew up in, I realised that this type of thing probably happens a lot. I think they need another server on during suppertime, or at least divide up the dining room sensibly. Imagine working the extreme ends of a restaurant!

I can come here knowing I can rely on their excellent kitchen, but only if I have copious amounts of time to burn. Perhaps off-hours is when they really shine.

Obligatory Title Pun: Their only GAFFE is tardiness.

Menu Readability: The menu is the size of a wakeboard, laminated and slathered in the worst calligraphic typeface, all bold.

Need to mention: While it did get busy that night, not enough that we really had to have given up our seats. Too bad. Being corrected shouldn't be a customer's first interaction with your staff.

What this place teaches me about myself: I probably do have copious amounts of time to burn, I just don't know where it is."
BGzavA_ddMr-jGmhArv7fg,"The ""Extreme"" in this gym's monikker couldn't be more apt. You'll be extremely frustrated dealing with the sales department of this club, who will undertake extreme measures to sign you up. This is unfortunate because this otherwise decent facility is marred by a unnecessarily aggressive sales culture.

The good: This is a spacious, clean, and aesthetically pleasing club. My very first experience he was after a gut-busting meal at Khao San Road when I happened to walk by and my bulging stomach (almost audibly) suggested I take a quick tour. First thought? Wow. It made my home gym seem like a dump, and by comparison the change rooms at extreme are positively spa-like. We're talking steam room, dry sauna, cold room(?!), lots of couches and seating, a tanning booth, full size lockers, a TV for some reason -- the works. And it isn't ass-to-ass in there (sorry for the visual). The workout area is on two-floors making it larger than a lot of city health-clubs. They have a spinning room, yoga studio, a personal training room, lots and lots and lots of machines.

The bad: Lots and lots and lots of machines. For a gym this size, I thought the free-weights section was a little limited. I was disappointed that there was a room full of equipment that you could only use if you hire one of their personal trainers. I also thought the juice bar and lounge (a seating area at the entrance of the gym with a monstrous projection screen TV) were unnecessary. They seem to want to create an environment where you can chill when you're not working out but in my opinion it's a waste of valuable real estate. 

The ugly: Dealing with sales. After my tour, I expected nothing less than to sit down with someone and get pitched on a membership. That's fair. And to be honest, I was pretty impressed with what I saw. The sales rep was friendly, though he did pull his share of ""let me call my manager to see what I can do for YOU"". Whatever, no sweat. He followed up a few days later and let my try the facility before I made up my mind. This is where things got pear-shaped. For starters, the management asked that I sign up for a full membership before I work out, noting that I could cancel anyway. What? I refused. They asked to hold my credit card while I exercised, and again, I refused. I left my drivers' licence and worked out for 1.5 hours. The facility was fine. For my purposes the equipment was A-OK. When I returned I got the hard sell again. I was offered an incredible rate, and they were willing to absorb the penalty to get out of my existing contract with a competitor. But they kept insisting I sign right then continually emphasizing that I could always cancel within 10 days anyway if I wanted to change my mind. Major alarm bells were going off, and it took me a while to extricate myself from this conversation.

Ultimately, even though many aspects of this facility was objectively better than what I am used to, and they matched the price of their competitors, there was something about the entire process that rubbed me the wrong way. My decision to stick with my home gym was ultimately the outcome of a one-man referendum on whether I should reward sales practices such as these, and truly I could not.

Obligatory Title Pun: It'll take MORE THAN WORDS to get me sign up here.

Menu Readability: The juice bar never seemed to be staffed anyway.

Need to mention: I was not a paying member here, but I did get to try the facility and staff on a free trial. Believe me, it was sufficient.

What this place teaches me about myself: When in doubt, trust the Yelp reviews."
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,If I'm in Henderson I always stop at this casino it's a locals casino and they lots of promotions for card members. The buffet is actually pretty good for the price and if you have enough slot points it's fee. They have lots of TVs to watch the sports and free drinks if your gambling. I've been to the pool a few times it's not the best casino pool but it's adequate. The casino is always clean the staff nice and helpful. Make sure to get a players club card so you can get points.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,I finally after 53 years made it to the Park and nicer than I thought it would be. Lots of parking and trails to walk on plus lots of bathrooms too. It's out in the country with businesses a few miles away. It's nice because it's only 10 minutes from Route 8 that takes you everywhere you need to go. The park is clean and well kept with tons of joggers and dog walkers. I saw a few police cars driving through so I would think safety isn't an issue.  It's worth stopping and it's free
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,Only here for a day but the interior of the Paris casino is incredible it makes me feel like I'm in Paris. It's hard to write a review because you really need to see the place in person. Lots of great restaurants and bakery shops with fresh French food. The casino is very clean and the staff has been really nice the gambling area isn't real big but there's enough slots and tables to keep you occupied it's also a short walk to the strip and a indoor walkway connects you to Bally's.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,It's in a great location down the street from Pitt and the hospitals but parking can be hard to find. The place isn't very big but the decor is really nice and they have a bar that gets packed on weekends.the sandwiches are reasonable priced all under $10.00. I like that there served on fresh Italian bread but it's hard to taste the fish or meat on it because of the French fries and coleslaw. I know it's a Pittsburgh tradition but after a few sandwiches I've lost my taste for them.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,I went to the boxing match at the arena which was really nice and a good view even from the top seats. It's really hard parking because the entrances are both on rally busy street be prepared to walk because this casino is huge. I've found some good room discounts on line but by the time I add parking and the resort fee it's not such a good deal. I park at Hooters and walk across the street saves me $12.00. They do Have a lot of good restaurants and good slot promotions for locals.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,It's my go to casino when I'm in town I feel they have the best poker room and it's right next to a food court that has some nice food places. I also watch my sports teams here the sports book has lots of seating plus I love the beer steamed hot dogs for $2.00 in the sports book. The buffets one of the best in town for the price dinner will run you about $20.00 the staff has always been real friendly I have no complaints plus there's lots of parking and close to the strip and airport.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,I played a lot when the poker room was at the Wynn and you parked on the parking garage and walked right in but the room was dark and small. It's a longer walk to the encore but the room is really bright and a lot larger. Plus the tables are spread out so your move on top of each other also thru bathrooms in the room so you don't have to walk out in the crowded casino. It's my favorite poker room second only to the Venetian. You can also order food to be delivered from a couple restaurants.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,It's always bright and clean. They gave lots of choices so I'm sure you'll find something you'll like the service gas always been good. The prices have gone up after they remodeled but I'm a big guy and I always get my money's worth. There's so many options it's hard to write a review on the food I would say it's worth going to if your in the area. I do think the Friday seafood buffet is over priced but breakfast is a good deal.  Get the casino players club for a couple dollars off the price.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,I'm amazed every time I'm there on big the convention center is. When they setup and tear down they drive 18 wheelers inside. The only problem parking can be a hassle and the walk is long. Just to get to a booth is a really long walk but every time I've been there it's been well organized plus there refreshment stands and lots of restrooms. Lots of security and cleaning personal which is great. Make sure you have good directions once your in the convention center because it's easy to get lost.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,"I bought a van there years ago and it was a good experience I purchased it from Woody the internet manager. Now I come in for oil changes it takes about an hour and a half each time but they do a really good job and they do a 100 point inspection. It was $55.00 which I think is reasonable. The waiting room has coffee and donuts. They have a oil change coupon when you check in on yelp but they don't honor it because it expired 4 years ago. It's fast paced there but everyone has always been nice,"
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,The place is huge and is a long walk to everywhere inside but the decor is beautiful and so are the statues. The buffet has long lines and is definitely over priced I was there once and they do have a lot of quality choices. There's multiple pools and there all real nice plus after you swim you can shop at the famous forum shops. The gambling floor is probably the longest in LV but at least you can stop at the food court in the middle. They also have bars and restaurants outside on the grounds.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,It's the nightclub to go to if your in LV the club is on the 2nd floor of the Venetian. There's normally a line so it's best to get a promoter to add you to the list. They normally gave free drinks for ladies for a couple hours. I like the entrance has bathtubs full of rose Petals nice touch. It's pretty romantic with lights turned down. The dance floor is on the second floor of the club and is small also drinks and  food are expensive. The upside is a lot of celebrities show up if there in town.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,It's interesting the Pizza shop is inside Moondoggies bar there is a big sign but it might be hard to figure out if your a tourist. It's not the nicest looking building from the outside but inside was pretty nice and clean. It's a dive bar so it's dark but there's enough seating and a few TVs. Almost to the end of the bar is the pizza order window and a server will bring your pizza out. I had a few pepperoni slices and I really liked the crust. People say they have really good wings too. I'll be back
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,It's at a busy mall the parking lot can get crowded and so can the drive in. The inside is spacious with high ceilings. There's lots of tables and chairs spread out so that's nice your not on top of one another. It's busy but the baristas are pretty fast and it's clean inside. They also have a patio out front to enjoy the 365 sunny days in Pittsburgh.  I really like the new remodel the service has always been fast and friendly. Britney always remembers the type coffee I drink when I arrive nice touch.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,When visitors come visit it's the most asked place to visit. It's right on LV Boulevard close to downtown I'm really glad it's free parking and free to get in. Sometimes there's a long line but it worth it if you watch the show the inside is normally crowded but there's no time limit so you'll get to see a lot of the things that were pawned on TV. Chances are you won't see any body from TV the days of tv having to work the Pawnshop are long gone. You can buy memorabilia and a Chumly bobble head inside.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,I try to go a few mornings fro the steak and egg special for $6.99 during the week before 11 am you'll probably have to wait a few minutes because there's always a line but it's worth it. I like sitting in the bar area because you can watch TV. They also have have homemade root beer which is hard to find. It's a locals casino a block off the strip but that means all there gambling are lower stakes than on the strip which is good also they have a small sports book and they have awesome BBQ ribs at night.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,It's incredible that everyday of the WSOP which lasts over a month thousands of poker players are in the same place. The WSOP is 4 huge rooms the one is almost 300 ft long full of poker tables it's sounds like thousands of crickets from players shuffling there chips. There's tournaments everyday and live cash games also. It's fee to get in and with stopping by even if you don't play piker. There's food and booths that sell a lot of poker items if you play a tournament you only have a 15% chance of placing in the money.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,I really like this casino mostly the front that looks like the NY skyline with the Statue of Liberty that is wearing a Vegas Knights Game Shirt nice touch. Also off to the side of the casino floor are buildings made to look like your walking in an old NY neighborhood with restaurants and delis serving NY foods. The pizza and Pastrami are excellent and where else can you see a roller coaster zooming through the casino above you. It's not the newest or nicest but it's a must see plus there's pedestrian bridges to other casinos
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,The hotel is along the river with a nice view and patio. The lobby is really nice with lots of space to hang out and use a computer or watch tv if you don't want to stay in your room. The hotel is across the parking lot from the north shore so there's lots of shops and dining plus the movie theater is there too. The interior is a little worn and it's hard to figure out where to order for the bistro. They do have a little gym with free weights and a little indoor pool. I think most people stay here hang out at the north shore and not at the hotel.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,It was busy it's actually always busy it was a half hour wait but we sat at the bar and had a drink. It's always very loud not much they can do because it's packed. The portions are really big and I've never had a bad steak it does take a while to get the food. When they brought the food they served my dad and I first instead of my mom and niece I even told the waiter good idea to serve the men first because I was hungry.  I give them 4 Stars because the portions are big and the food is Good.  Actually the decor is 5 Stars I love the western look.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,It's at a busy mall the parking lot can get crowded and so can the drive in. The inside is spacious with high ceilings.

3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,The parking lot is huge it took me a while to figure it out guess your better off valeting. The buffet was really good with lots of items I looked at the menus for a few restaurants but found the prices a little high I think the buffet is the best price. The casino looks like your normal casino gambling floor. I was really impressed by how nice the poker room was it was well lit and very clean plus all the tables and chairs looked new and were comfortable. I loved all the TVs and the free coffee plus the room had lots of action going on. 5 stars to the poker manager.

3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,"I'm just traveling through but I needed to go shopping and it's the only mall around. It's really big with lots of parking and a movie theater and a huge gym inside. Probably half the stores are gone but the do have a JC Penney's,Macy's and a Dicks.i guess a lot of seniors walk in circles in the morning the one nice thing is there is lots of chairs in the middle of the walkway the whole way around the mall. There a food court and a Panderas plus an excellent Chinese buffet in the mall. The area right around the mall has lots of fast food and nice restaurants. It's actually pretty nice"
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,Ok it's not the nicest hotel or casino but I thought the mid evil show with the knights and horses was excellent where else can you eat with your hands and nobody stares at you. Plus it has a tram and bridges to other casinos. The mid evil architecture is one of the nicest looks on the strip it really looks great at night. It's also a great place to take photos of the knights plus you might run into Merlin. The buffets not that great but it's not hard to find a 2-1. The pools really nice. I've never stayed at the hotel because the reviews are pretty scary but I like being in a castle so I always stop.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,"It's was really hard to find and than even worse throng to find parking because of the traffic and all the building are right next to each other. Than trying to find the entrance plus the room was a challenge but the do have a help desk and they were helpful. I was just a visitor but it seemed like nurses and doctors were doing a good job. It was a nice touch have a Starbucks,bank,gift shoo in the hospital. Also the visitor waiting rooms were nice each had a TV. The cafeteria was great with lots of food selections. The patient arrived in bad shape and was released in good shape so that's always a plus."
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,It's inside the Orleans casino and is always busy but you can also eat at the bar if there's a line for the tables. I always get the appetizers that are on special for $6.00 from 3pm-7pm. The foods always been good but I just feel it's over priced probably because it's in a casino. I always ask for server Tori she's really nice and efficient.weekend nights there's always a line but if you join there club you get a lot of specials.  Service has been better and it's hard to beat the $6.00 appetizers and $12.95 full rack of ribs. The hostess named Jackie has the best personality of any hostess at a TGI Friday's nationwide.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,It's a huge casino/hotel that is at the end of the strip and it's a long walk to the other casinos plus it's expensive to park at the hotel I always park in the convention parking lot and walk from the convention center to the hotel. The shark reef is amazing mostly if your a child it's easy to find coupons don't pay full price. There's lots of restaurants and shops but everything including the coffee is expensive. The pool is really really nice with waves and a beach. I like like Sunday buffet it's great quality where comfortable shoes and bring suntan lotion if your goi g to the pool so you don't look like a lobster at the buffet.
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,"They get a 5 star rating because they had amazing deals on cloths and I saved $170.00. Actually the item I was looking for they didn't have but the Assistant Manager Mary Jo helped me look for something similar and she also showed me the clearance rack that had awesome deals. She was great and I ended up purchasing 183.00 worth of cloths but after saving $148.00 with discounts it cost me less than $35.00. The cashier also found some discounts for me. Everyone in the store was really nice and helpful. 
So I have to say the Best JC Penney's in the country is the one in Mills Mall  
Really it is
I just got a $20.00 coupon in my email so my actual cost was $15.00"
3xBFFH866WoySDG7uuwBSQ,"Location Location Location I think these luxury Apartments are in a great location. Only 20 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and located only a couple miles from every store you need plus you can walk outside and have nice restaurants,gyms,bank and a coffee shop a minute walk away. The areas really safe because there's Corp headquarters of major companies in the same area so you have lots of security. Great place to have pets and walk because there's lots of open areas. If your looking for an apartment you really need to stop and talk to the leasing people who are really nice. The public areas of the building are incredible I like the pool,spa,free Starbucks coffee machine,weight room,computer room and all the areas are really clean. 
       It's a must see if looking for an luxury apt"
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Time for my monthly lunch with my best friend. My friend picked Zoe's Kitchen. It turned out to be a good choice.

Concept: You go to the counter to order, are given a number to take to your table. You need to obtain your own drink, silverware, napkins, etc. You sit down and your food is brought to you when ready. If you've ever been to a Carl's Jr then you know what to expect for service. However, there are signs as you enter the establishment touting the freshness of the ingredients, stating that the food components are delivered and prepared fresh daily.

Food and Service: Since this is a largely self-service concept, there is limited contact with staff. The food was outstanding. My friend had the Greek salad with chicken ($9.69). It had greens, tomato, cucumber, onion, feta cheese, peppers, potato salad and bread. I had the Gruben sandwich ($7.59) with turkey, swiss cheese, slaw, and mustard on rye bread with a side (I picked some yummy white beans with rosemary). The bread was a very mild rye that looked white, not the hearty dark German rye I am used to. It was good though. The menu is diverse and interesting enough that I would eat here again to try some of the other items.

Seating: Booths and tables and chairs inside and a few tables and chairs on the sidewalk outside. For customers with a walker or a wheelchair it feels like a cramped obstacle course. The sound level was reasonable enough to carry on a conversation with your co-diners. Lighting was bright and cheery.

Parking: This upscale strip shopping center has a congested feeling traffic flow (who designs these things?). The handicapped parking is about 3 stores down from Zoe's, so a short walk for the mobility impaired."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Another 115 degree day in the Valley, so I was hoping to complete my errands as early as possible. I had finished my Safeway shopping by 5:30am (they open at 5am) and had just a few ad items to pick up at this Frys at 6:30am (they don't open until 6am). 
My first surprise was that the door was locked. As I peeked through the glass door I could see people in the store so I walked down to the door at the north end of the store. It was open. I asked why the south door was still locked and was advised that they do not unlock it until 7am. Huh?? You are either open or not open, not sort of open. Jeesh. 
Should I have know about this issue in advance? Maybe, but due to many issues with this store I rarely come here anymore. I can no longer use this store in the winter. They do not turn on the lights in the parking lot, so if it is still dark when I get to the store in the morning I have to traverse the parking lot in the dark. 
The store is laid out very strange. Plan on making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches? Bread is located next to the frozen food in the center of the store and peanut butter is all the way across the store near the house cleaning supplies. Many of the items that used to attract me to this store are no longer sold here as they transitioned from the Marketplace format to just a grocery store format a few years ago.
This is a large store, yet there was only ONE cashier. Yes, there was a self check aisle open, but if I wanted to check my own groceries I would go to Winco or someplace with lower prices. The one thing that full price grocery stores have going for them is SERVICE! Service means sufficient cashiers, bagging customers' groceries and placing them in the cart for them."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"After a trip to the Goodwill in this same parking lot, my tummy starts rumbling for lunch. It is 10:10am and my 4am breakfast is long gone. I look around and see a neon ""Open"" sign glowing from across the parking lot. The sign on the door says they open at 10am, so I hustle in and am immediately seated in a booth. 

A basket of tortilla chips and a small bowl of salsa instantly appear and a smiling waitress takes my order promptly. I order a small chicken torta (less than $6). The chips were odd. Some tasted stale and like unsalted Fritos. Others tasted like over salted fresh tortilla shells. The salsa was watery and not to my taste. I can't quite put my finger on what was missing in it, but it tasted like tomato juice. 

My torta arrived steaming hot with a side of potato chips. It seemed like carb overkill--tortilla chips, potato chips, and the bread in the sandwich. That said, I loved the toasted roll and the chicken. The tomato on the sandwich was pale with no taste. 

The decor here is strange. I know that they have tried to turn an old JBs into a Mexican vibe eating place, but the painted walls were really bugging me. About half way through my sandwich I figured it out. They tried to make the walls in the dining area look like they had been stuccoed, but instead it looks like a bunch of 3 year olds had finger painted the wall with poo. Yech. Two walls had flat screen TVs on them, but with no volume and on different stations. Just as they were bringing my sandwich, someone switched on some Mexican polka music so loud that it startled me. 

Would I eat here again. Probably not. If someone was just craving a torta would I mention this place? Yes, but only because I don't know of many torta places nearby."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"This office of the Ironwood Cancer and Research Center was formerly known as Southwest Hematology Oncology, P.C.

I would give different review ratings for the hematology services of Dr. Rajesh Kukonoor, MD versus the office. Dr. Kukonoor has been caring for my husband's hyperclotting condition for about 4 years now. He is attentive, concerned, and very knowledgeable. You never feel rushed and he answers all of your questions. I would give Dr. K a 5 star rating.

The office I would give 3 stars to. If you call during office hours, your call is not returned until after 5 pm. The waiting room is always packed. They do have a sign up advising you to let them know if you have been waiting more than 20 minutes. On our current visit they had us sign a bunch of forms saying they have the right to charge our credit card if the insurance company doesn't pay or if there is an unpaid balance more than 30 days after the insurance company has paid their part. Having had issues in the past with insurance companies, I know it can take months to straighten those out.

RED FLAG: The office now has a sign up that they no longer take cash in payment or copayment, just credit cards or debit cards. So much for notion of US cash as legal tender (currency that cannot be denied as payment for goods and services) and I guess they have no plan to treat the 10 million unbanked US citizens (1 in 12 households in the US according to the FDIC). 

The waiting room is too small for the number of waiting patients most of the time. Parking is quite far from the office and would be especially difficult for the chemotherapy patients or the mobility impaired.

Bottom line: I would highly recommend Dr. Kukonoor, but the office practices are problematic."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Needed to use up an Applebee's gift card before it expired, so brought my 7 year old grandson and 3 year old granddaughter here for lunch following an active morning at the natural history museum. The place looks clean and parking is close to the door. We were seated immediately at 11:30am. There is a mixture of tables and chairs and booths. I noted that we were seated in a booth section with other families with infants and children and that most of the adult-only parties were seated apart from us. Probably a good idea.
I had the lunch combo ($6.99) for which I selected soup and a turkey sandwich. The soup was very tasty and properly seasoned. The turkey was not the pressed lunch meat variety you get at the deli or someplace like Paradise Bakery, but rather a large chunk of real turkey breast. The lettuce and tomatoes were very fresh. The focaccia bread had a nice chew and held up well to the veggies and turkey.
The kids both had the chicken fingers and fries ($4.49). They each had 3 medium sized, perfectly cooked slabs of chicken breasts and the fries were the large chunk size, not shoestring, but the kids really liked them. They had some mild seasoning on them.
Cons: The chicken fingers and fries were just warm, not hot. It took quite a while for the food to come out. I heard several parents trying to distract their hungry kids during the delay. They do provide some crayons and coloring sheets to occupy the kids, but the delay in getting the food is far longer than it takes the kids to complete the coloring. 
Overall, it was better than I expected from this chain, but they certainly do have some opportunities for improvement in speed of service and making sure that all the hot foods come to the table actually hot."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Hellooooooo . . . .. . . 1995 called and wants this Chuck E Cheese back. Entertainment is via 11 CRT tube TV monitors and one faded 1st generation flat screen TV monitor. The video loop is loaded with kid versions of rap music (gag). The most up-to-date monitor had a Windows XP logo floating on it the whole time we were there.

I had visited this establishment several times when my kids were small in the 1980s and early 1990s and I was shocked to see that many of the rides and games are still the same ones my 30 something daughters had used when they were small. They were all new to my 2 year grandson, so he seemed happy with these ancient rides and games. An employee dressed as the Chuckster came out for about 5 minutes and made a real impression on the 2 year old as they ""high fived.""

Now for the food: If Organ Stop serves a 3 star pizza, and Peter Piper serves a 2 star pizza, Chuck E Cheese serves a 1 star pizza. Soda, iced tea, or a juice box is all they had to drink. My daughter had a salad, said it was OK, nothing special.

Staff: It looked like only 2 employees were working, which is probably about right for a weekday lunch time since only 3 families were in the restaurant the whole time we were there. Clueless alert--my daughter asked the person behind the food counter if the iced tea was fresh brewed, and he pulled out a jug and pointed to the label on the jug that said ""Lipton's fresh brewed"" and proudly answered, ""Yes, it is fresh brewed!"" She said it tasted wretched.

Parking is close to the door. The restaurant appears clean. Seating is a mix of tables and chair and booths. Two drinks, one very small awful pizza with one topping, and one salad came to $20 plus another $5 for tokens for the rides and games."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"My friend and I decided to try Kneaders for lunch. We arrived at 11am and there were 2 customers ahead of us at the order counter, but one of them took 10 minutes to place her order. She peppered the counter person with zillions of questions and held up the line. Kudos for the counter person for not being sharp with her after the first 8 minutes and seeing a line of 12 customers backing up behind the inquisitive (and thoughtless) customer. At minute 9, a second counter person opened a cash register and started taking orders to speed things up. 

When my friend and I finally placed our order we both ordered the club sandwich (turkey, roast beef, ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and dressing on a homemade white bread) for $7.99. The sandwich was large and tasty. It does not come with any sides (a dill pickle or small amount of chips would have been nice). They also sell a wide variety of baked goods that looked yummy. The homemade bread selection is extensive. When your sandwich is ready a staff member brings it to your table for you. Beverages are self-serve.

There is also a small boutique merchandise area (sort of a mini Cracker Barrel store idea). The thing that keeps this from being a 4 star experience is the poor customer traffic flow and overcrowding. There is a long line to order your food and even a long line to dump your tray and trash and another long line to exit the building. The line to order and the line to leave the restaurant tend to get jumbled together creating gridlock.  Parking is close to the door. The restaurant is clean and bright and seating is a mix of tables and chairs and booths. They also have a drive-through.

Would we return? We certainly would not attempt it at peak traffic times like lunch."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"I was looking for something light for dinner after shopping at the Trader Joe's across the street. I stopped here and ordered the Korean steak lettuce wraps. I was expecting small strips of steak with a spicy sauce and some veggies and a stack of iceberg lettuce to wrap the filling with. The first surprise was that the beef was just coarsely ground meat, not strips of beef. The second surprise was the sauce. It was not spicy, but it was oily. The veggies did seem fresh. The portion was just right for a light dinner and was a little over $8 with tax. 

The ordering process was odd. You stand in a line and place your order with a person behind a counter (not intuitive since the cash registers are not visible). The take-out area is part of the same section of counter, so it feels confusing and cluttered with people milling around waiting for take-out while other people are placing their orders. The kitchen is open and once you place your order you are supposed to figure out where to go next. I walked into the open dining area to look for a table and stopped by the soda station to get a glass of water. I couldn't find the napkins. I found a table and put my number on the table. A young man brought my food to the table once it was ready and got me some napkins (it turns out they were toward the back of the soda station). When I was done I couldn't figure out where to put my trash and plate. I watched for a few minutes and looks like they have staff to bus the tables. So this seems to be some hybrid between fast food self-serve and a sit-down restaurant.

The place seems clean. The staff was polite but I never saw a smile nor welcoming word from anyone. Parking is close to the door. I'm not sure there is anything here to prompt me to return."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Six am on a Sunday morning and I had just finished some 5am shopping at the Riverview shopping center. The place was already half full of  hungry customers. This IHOP replaced the one on Main and Dobson a couple of years ago, so I expected the look and feel of a new restaurant. Oddly enough, the carpet is already threadbare in high traffic areas. The walls and booths and table are still in good condition and are typical IHOP, Dennys, Cocos style furnishings. 
The place looks clean and parking is close to the door. One cleanliness issue did emerge--the knife had food still on it from a previous customer. Fortunately, the hostess has left the second set of eating utensils on the table, so I just swapped the icky ones for other set.

So, how is the food?
Coffee--piping hot with thermal carafe back up left on your table. I hate bitter coffee (yep Starbucks, I am looking at you). This coffee tasted fresh, not bitter, but did have a slight acid taste.
Belgian waffle--cooked through, but so cold the the clump of butter on top did not melt at all.
Sunny side up eggs--cooked to the correct consistency but cold. Cold eggs, really???
Bacon--I asked for extra-crispy bacon. Two-thirds of the bacon was indeed crispy, but about 1/3 of each bacon strip was pretty chewy.

Service--Excellent and saved this from being a 2 star experience. The server checked back several times to see if I needed anything and anticipated items I might need for my meal, such as condiments and cream for my coffee. She came with the bill just as I was finishing my meal and even offered more coffee than what was in the thermal carafe.

I think that next time I get the urge for breakfast at Riverview, I will skip the IHOP and just go to the Cracker Barrel across the parking lot."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"First trip today from the Sycamore Mesa station to the Central and Washington station due a jury duty summons for the cattle call on Jefferson and 1st Ave Maricopa Superior Court. I did not want to drive in rush hour traffic and take the shuttle bus from the Madison street parking garage, so the light rail seemed to make sense.

The light rail stops at every single station (whether there are people getting on or off at that particular station). This made the trip from Mesa to Downtown Phoenix about the same amount of time as driving it in rush hour--so no real time savings. It costs $4 for a full day pass or $2 per ride. Using Mapquest and entering in my car info it would have cost $1.20 in gas each way, so no real dollar savings there.

The light rail stations and trains were clean and on-time. The down side is that some of the people using the light rail have no common sense nor manners. For example, the young man sitting across from me decided to whip out his cell phone and have a loud conversation for about half of my ride back to Mesa. Another clueless young man decided that it was too much effort to put his bike in the rack designated for that purpose and chose to block an entrance/exit instead. He was not alone--I saw 4 other people do the same thing over the course of a single round trip. 

I am a fan of the concept of mass transit, but I do have mixed feelings about fixed rail solutions. If population centers or work corridors shift in any way you are stuck with an albatross of expensive, non-flexible public transit like many of the older rust bucket cities. Interestingly, the trains were only about half full during rush hour traffic today, so even with the current train alignment the system does not appear to be highly utilized."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"This Safeway went back to being a 24 hour store once the ASU students returned to school. However, when I went early this morning they were closed. Without warning, they went back to the 5am-1am hours and were closed when I made a special trip over there this morning. Traffic at this intersection is awful, so I try to shop between 2-5am to avoid the traffic congestion. 

A recent change in the layout of the store has made shopping trips here confusing and these trips take way longer than they need to. For example: Are you looking for cottage cheese? Not found in the dairy area at all. They could have put it with the milk--nope not there. They could have put it with the cheese, yogurt, and butter--nope not there. Finally found it in a separate case over by the cleaning products and diapers. Sour cream?--found it on the opposite side of the cottage cheese case (but not visible if you are looking at the cottage cheese). Looking for frozen fish? Not found in the frozen foods areas--found it in a case on the other side of the store by the produce and pharmacy area.

Even if you wait until the 5am opening time, shopping is challenging because the aisles are blocked with restocking cases. Instead of restocking one row at a time or only staging items you plan to restock in the next hour or so, boxes are left in the middle of aisles for hours at a time.

It is critical that you check your receipt before leaving the store. You never know what price you are paying until the entire order is rung up, so it is impossible to catch the errors as the items are rung up. It is common for 2-4 items to ring up at the wrong price. You then have to stand and wait to get things corrected.

I will be looking for alternatives to this store for my future grocery shopping."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"This falls into the category ""Things I didn't know I needed, but I really did!""

After shopping at the Hobby Lobby next door, I spied the massage chair out front of this business. I went in to inquire about a chair massage, and was informed that for the same price I could get a full one hour Thai massage. Apparently, a 20% grand opening discount brought the cost of a one hour massage down to just $28! Awesome.

As a first time customer, I filled out a client form--where they ask you how firm you want your massage (light, medium or firm). Since I had read about how vigorous Thai massage can be, I picked medium pressure and that turned out to the right thing to do (medium here is firm anywhere else).

My therapist was Sonny. He did a great job. The massage starts with a warm soak of the feet while the therapist massages your scalp, face, neck and shoulders. You stay fully clothed for the full massage. The full body is massaged, including range of motion stretches and lymphatic drainage. Acupressure points get special treatment and the fascia on the bottom of the feet was stretched and massaged.

What keeps this from a 5 star review is the physical layout. Even though the facility is clean and the lobby is very nice, there are two massage rooms with EIGHT beds per room. There is a curtain between the beds. Maybe in Thailand this is normal, but for Western sensibilities having multiple people in the same massage room presents issues. I have noted that some other reviewers (especially men) were reluctant to tell the therapist that the touch was painful or too firm. Clients may have been more forthcoming with the therapists if there were no other people present (fear of being perceived as wimp).

Overall, my first Thai massage was a positive experience for me and I plan to return in the future."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"12/6/2017 Update: Got a call from Sonora Quest stating that part of my samples drawn 12/4/17 had not been handled properly (one of the samples was supposed to have been frozen and it was not). So I had to have a re-stick (blood redrawn) to have a new sample sent to the processing center. I went to another Sonora Quest location closer to my home to have this done. Now I am nervous that my test may not be completed before my follow up appointment with my doctor.
_____________
News flash to Sonora Quest: Not everyone is computer literate enough to check in on IPad tablets. About 1/3 of the people checking in on the tablets struggled to do this. One elderly man was nearly in tears, even after staff tried to help him. Additionally, some of the people in line to check in could not read English, so the tablet was pretty much useless since all instructions were in English only.

A nice feature is the monitor that tracks were you are in line for being called back for your blood draw. However, since my doctor sent me over directly from his office, I did not have an appointment. So, once I worked my way from number 10 in line to number 1, I kept getting bumped back to number 3 in line as appointments filtered in. This was pretty discouraging. 

The good news for me is that this was a one-time experience for me since this was a referral from a specialist. Most of my blood work is ordered by my family doctor and they draw it right in the office during my appointment. Wait time for my blood draw was 45 minutes at 2pm with 10 people ahead of me.

The phlebotomist was able to obtain my sample on the first stick, so kudos to the back office staff and the front office desk staff was friendly and efficient. Just offer the option of staff-assisted check in instead of just the IPad thing (ugh) and I would bump this up to 4 stars."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Update: Strike 3. Ordered product on 10/1/12 with an expectation that product would be ready for pickup within the 2-3 day window projected by Toliver's. Product actually arrived 10/8/12. Reducing rating from 3 stars to 2 stars.

Putting down Armstrong vinyl tile in our bathrooms and the enclosed directions recommended using a specific Armstrong latex primer on our concrete floor before laying the tiles. We called Lowes (since that is where we had bought the tiles) and they do not carry the product. Same with Home Depot and Ace Hardware. The Armstrong customer service toll-free number recommended this Toliver's ""Carpet One"" store near our home.
Strike 1: When we called to see if they had the product in stock, they had no clue and stated they would call us back with the answer. After 2 hours they had still not called back.
Strike 2: We called them back and this time waited on the phone while they checked and were told that it is not in stock, but they could order it and it should come in about 2-3 days. However, we had to get in our car and drive to their store and pay for the product before they would order it.
Nervously waiting to see if there is a strike 3. We will give them 3 days to see if the product comes in and then start calling to see if we can move things along.

If you are buying carpet or tile, they seem to carry a wide variety of products. The showroom is little cluttered and dated looking. I cannot speak to their installation practices since we did not use those services. Parking is close to the door.

One final warning: this business has the light rail running in front of the store, so you cannot turn left from the eastbound lanes of Apache into the Toliver's parking lot, nor can you turn left out of their parking lot when you leave. So the only way to get into the parking lot is from the right lane of the westbound lanes of Apache."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"6/22/17 Update: Last visit there was was a 2 hour wait to see the doctor. Today I was seen on time, so I am upgrading my rating to 4 stars from the initial 3 stars.

Newer facility next to Tempe St. Luke's hospital. Was in an ER with a knee injury and the soonest appointment I could get with this practice was about 2 weeks after the injury. That was scary since my knee was locked in a 90 degree angle (I was unable to straighten the leg) and I was on crutches. I was told to check in 30 minutes before my appointment time even though I had printed out and completed the online new patient forms before my appointment.

Two hours before my scheduled appointment I received a call from this office and was told that I could not be seen in their Tempe office due to some ""technical"" issue. I was given a choice of driving into downtown Phoenix or rescheduling for a week later. With my knee still iffy, I chose to reschedule to the next week. We are now 3 weeks out from the injury.

The day of my appointment I arrived 15 minutes before my ""check-in"" time. There were about 12 people in the waiting room. Only about 8 of them seemed to be patients, the other 4 were family. There was ample seating for about 20 people and a TV monitor showing infomercials for the doctors with this group. The receptionist was friendly and bilingual.

There were 2 doctors working out of this office on this day. I was finally seen by the doctor 2 hours after my ""check-in"" time (1.5 hours after my appointment time). Keep in mind that this is the end of May and the winter visitors are gone, so I can only imagine how long the waits are in the winter.

Once you are called to the exam room, a medical assistant takes your vitals signs and asks what happened. Then a Physician's Assistant (PA) comes in and asks what happened. Finally, the doctor comes in and asks what happened. Hmmmm.

I will review the doctor separately after my care is complete."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"I have lived in Tempe since 1973 and love the community, but we have NEVER had decent leadership (mayor, council, etc). Here are a few of our historic, current and future blunders:
1) Tempe Town Lake. A San Antonio Riverwalk ""wanna be"" with a rubber dam that ruptures leaving Tempe infested with mosquitoes and bugs of all sorts. The ""wetlands"" east of the dam (due to leaking) does indeed attract migrating birds that have a nasty habit of getting sucked into the engines of jets landing at Sky Harbor Airport (not surprising nor unexpected since the ""Town Lake"" is in the flight path for Sky Harbor).
2) Tempe Marketplace. Tempe limits business signage to prevent ""Visual Blight"" (whatever that is), except here. Along the 202 glaring neon signs (putting Las Vegas to shame) touting Tempe Marketplace businesses distract drivers along the 202 (especially at night). Since Mesa's Riverview shopping is less than 2 miles away and Tempe's AZ Mills is just 4 miles away and in theory the city would like to support the Mill Ave merchants, why would they put this monstrosity here???
3) Mill Ave was packed with local stores and had a quirky, fun college town feeling in the 1970s when we moved here. Locals (my family included) went there all the time. Then our city fathers decided to ""improve"" Mill Ave by ""yuppifying"" it and chasing out local business and pursuing national chains. The death knell was when they built Tempe Marketplace. The new plan for attracting customers to Mill Ave is to spend MILLIONS for a slow motion trolly that will block/impede the right lane of Mill Ave in both directions from Southern Ave directly to and around Michael Monti's restaurant. Can you spell BOONDOGGLE???

We do have some nice parks (like Kiwanis Park on Mill and Baseline), we have many bike and walking paths, a nice library, attractive neighborhoods--many of them without the loathsome HOAs that plague much of the valley.
I know this was long, sorry."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Pros: The recent remodel has improved the physical appearance of the store. The produce and meats are OK.
Cons: There always seems to be a long line at the customer service desk. They should probably have 2 employees staffing it at peak times.
There are frequently seedy looking characters outside the store. We once had someone try and steal our grocery cart full of groceries as we were trying to pay the bill at the checkout counter (pretty brazen). The guy just threw his bag in our cart and started walking away with the full cart. My husband noticed and started after the guy and he took off. This was a couple of years ago, but I am still super vigilant at this store now.
Some employees at this store need to get back to the basics on service. The last 3 times I was here the cashier bagged my groceries but did not put them in my cart--just shoved them across the counter for me to put them in the cart.

Update 10/18/13: NO CASHIERS! I did my weekly shopping today and when I went to check out nearly 1.5 hours after the store was opened, there were still NO CASHIERS available. It had taken nearly and hour to do my weekly shopping and I had about $100 worth of food in my cart. The only employee I could find was a young man sweeping the floor. When I asked if he could call a cashier up to the check out lanes, I was told that everyone had to use the self-serve check out. There were no employees there either! Several people were having trouble with the self check out and looked frustrated. 
I gave up. If I want to self-check a full cart of groceries I would be at a Winco or Fresh and Easy--NOT a Safeway! I left my cart at the front of the store. I tracked down the guy pushing the broom and told him that he may want to return the items from my cart quickly since there were a lot of frozen foods including a couple of containers of ice cream. 
Bottom line: I ended up leaving the store and going to FRYS to do my weekly shopping run. Thanks a lot Safeway for wasting an hour of my life."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Farmers Market?? Conjures up images of fresh, local produce. Not so much here. Most of the produce is from Mexico. Bananas from Mexico go from under-ripe to over-ripe without ever stopping at ripe. Mexican produce can be grown downhill from pastures and animal pens, something not permitted in the US. If it something I can cook the bejeebers out of then it doesn't matter, but if I have to eat it without cooking (like radishes, cucumbers, tomatoes, watermelon, etc), then I won't buy Mexican produce and end up making a trip to a real, local farmer's market.
The meat prices are higher and the quality is not as good as when it was Sunflower Market. The Sunflower beef was labeled free of hormones and antibiotics and much of it was labeled grass-fed. The Sprouts beef does no have this type of labeling.
The deli staff is asleep at the switch. I stopped by today for a sales item of a deli roasted turkey and they hadn't even started the turkeys yet and the rotisserie chickens were still raw (but at least loaded in the cooker). I would understand if was 7am (when the store is open for business), but it was almost 10am. They also seem to only carry Boar's Head deli meats (over-priced and not very good quality). 
What about the canned food? The canned mushrooms are from CHINA (really??? the folks that put melamine in pet food and infant formula??). Some of the bottles of fruit juice have High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) NOT something you expect from a farmers market or natural food store.
The dairy has more organic milk, eggs, cheese, and butter choices than any regular grocery store, and the bulk barrels offer a diverse selection of products.
The frozen food department has a nice selection of healthier choices (such as organic and whole grain products).
The check out staff is awesome. The store is very clean and well organized. The parking is easy and close to the door. There are plenty of shopping carts. Overall, plenty of room for improvement, but certainly fills a niche that is missing in regular grocery stores."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Two words: SMART METERS! SRP is on a huge drive to install smart meters, even though several public health departments have requested a moratorium until the health effects of electomagnetic and RF radiation can be studied (see link below). Utilities are claiming this is the same radiation produced by microwave ovens and cell phones and therefore it is safe. It is NOT the same thing, this is PULSED radiation which may be more dangerous (my husband worked in electronics for 40 years and has researched this topic extensively). 
When we got the notice that they planned to install the meters, we called SRP and requested to opt out. The SRP customer service rep argued with my husband on the phone and finally stated that they could do that for a charge of $20/month to send someone out to read the meter each month (some utilities offer this option at no charge). We agreed to that charge, but the charge labeled ""Field Visit Fee"" is actually $21.86. The first month they actually charged the fee even though they never even read the meter--the bill stated that it was estimated because the meter was not read! We are still be charged the ""Monthly Service Charge"" of $15 as well (which covered reading our meter for the last 40 years). 
http://www.sej.org/publications/tipsheet/many-are-claiming-health-problems-caused-smart-meters

10/30/2012 We found it odd that our SRP bills had $21.86 charge for reading our meter every month, yet it seemed like every other month there was a note on our bill that the meter was NOT read, just estimated. When we called the SRP supervisor states that they have NO intention of reading our meter every month and that the ACTUAL CHARGE for reading our meter is $40!!! They just break it into monthly installments of $21.86 to make it easier for us to pay the bill!!! You have got to be kidding! We are highly disappointed that SRP chose to roll out a smart meter program before the scientific evidence was in and instead chose to use their customers as guinea pigs in a large uncontrolled experiment."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"My hands and fingernails were a mess from bare handed gardening and pulling weeds. I haven't had a manicure or pedicure in a long time, since my last pedicure at a nearby nail salon resulted in the nail tech cutting one of my toes, followed by a cellulitis infection, followed by 10 days of antibiotics. 

My daughter had been to Colorful Nails several times and highly recommended them, so I thought I would give them a try. I got the basic manicure ($12) with clear nail polish. I figured if I stuck with the basics it would be harder to mess it up. I called ahead and was told to just come in, no appointment needed. I show up 10 minutes later to find all 5 pedicure chairs full and two people waiting for manicures and only 3 nail techs working. This doesn't look good. One of the people waiting for a manicure looked upset and got up to leave without having her manicure (waited too long). 

Suddenly, 3 more nail techs burst through the door and instantly start working on the me, the lady who had been waiting, and on a couple of the pedicure clients who had just been soaking. Turns out the owner's brother also runs a nail salon and they had no customers, the owner called him and he and his whole staff closed his salon and drove right over to help out. 

My manicure was excellent, including a massage of my hands and forearms (something that should normally be part of a manicure, but seems to be done at fewer and fewer nail salons). The other customers seemed to have excellent results from their nail work as well. There is indeed a big screen TV, but it can only be seen from the pedicure chairs. For those of us getting a manicure, it is not visible at all.

Parking is close to the door. Other reviewers mentioned they were given something to drink--not so for anyone I saw there on my visit. The staff looked very stressed and focused on the task at hand with no talking (possibly due to the rush of customers), but once additional nail techs showed up they started smiling and interacting with the customers. In retrospect, I wonder why I was told to come over now if they knew they were so backed up."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Unlike Dr. Who's Tardis, which is small on the outside and big on the inside, this steakhouse looks large on the outside, but surprisingly small once you are inside. I went for lunch (11:15am). I know this is a chain owned by the same company that owns the Red Lobster and Olive Garden, so I was not expecting a mom and pop local experience. That was good because my first impression was this was a 3.75 star experience (I rounded up to 4). 
Let's start with the decor--every western cliche you ever heard of is here. A couple of horse saddles hanging from the ceiling, shelves of cowboy boots, pictures of the Grand Canyon, wild horses running and a waterfall at Yosemite, photos of cowboys at rodeos, map of Texas, and a whole wall of western belt buckles. Not just a casual decoration of the place--nearly every wall or surface is plastered with this stuff (sometimes less is more). The background music was country and western.
The seating hostess and server were very prompt, attentive, and just plain nice. The server brought warm whole grain bread and butter right away. I got the western mac n cheese and soup lunch combo for just $6.99. Now the motto here must be ""Bacon hides bland food really, really well."" The soup was a broccoli cheddar/asiago cheese with bacon bits. The mac n cheese had toasted bread crumbs on top and was loaded with bacon. The combo comes with homemade warm potato chips covered in cheese sauce and--you guessed it--bacon. Ironically, the cheese sauce in the soup, the mac n cheese and on the chips all tasted the same. There was no variation (do they get this from a can or something?).
Now, I know this is a steakhouse and I was scoping it out for a later dinner with my husband. So I watched attentively as an older couple at the table next to my booth dug into their steaks. They hacked and sawed and practically had to chisel the meat into bit sized pieces. After watching this struggle, I am guessing that these steaks are not especially tender. I can't say for sure, but that certainly didn't encourage me to order steak from here.
Parking was easy and close to the door. Would I eat here again? Maybe, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Pros: An open cell foam mattress with a 10 year warranty and a 100 day free sleep test. Unlike closed cell foam mattresses (like memory foam) this foam does not trap body heat and bounces back to normal shape after each use (memory foam can get crushed by your weight leaving a groove in the mattress in the shape of your body).

The staff at the store were wonderful in explaining the product and they have multiple beds for customers to do a test rest on. The mattress arrived in a few days (they deliver it from California) and this is an American made product. After sleeping on the mattress for a few days, I can tell I am going to love this mattress. The price is fair for this quality mattress.

Cons: The store is hard to find, in kind of a sketchy neighborhood, and I had to circle the store 3 times to figure out where I could park. I usually pay cash for goods and services, but you can only buy the product by going online and using a credit card. The staff at the store actually did that for me, but you have the option of going home and ordering online from there.

When the box with the mattress arrives, it is just left at your door. This was a full size mattress and I could barely drag it in the house and down to the bedroom. Wrestling the rolled up mattress out of the box was a Herculean effort that left me exhausted. After resting for a while, I rolled out the mattress and cut off the outer plastic. The instructions advise you to be careful cutting the inner plastic wrap so as not to cut the mattress cover. Easier said than done. As you start to cut the inner plastic wrap, the air causes the mattress to blow up (expand) like a balloon! After finally cutting the inner wrap off, I realized that the inner plastic sheet was now stuck under the mattress. So, with another Herculean effort, I had to lift the heavy mattress with one hand while pulling the plastic wrap out from under the mattress. Pant, pant, pant . . . By this time I was shaking, clammy, and my heart rate and blood pressure were off the chart. 

Overall, pleased with the mattress, but wish they offered a delivery and set up service option and accepted payment other than the online credit card situation."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Having lived in our current home for 30 years, we have painted our home a number of times over the years. We have used other name brand paints and been disappointed in color fading and paint chipping and pealing even with meticulous prep work before priming and painting. After extensive Internet research, including contractor forums I decided to use Dunn-Edwards paint this time. 

Pros:
*Counter staff was helpful and all the necessary paint supplies are here, so one-stop shopping.
*Parking was plentiful and close to the door. 
*Many choices of colors, gloss levels and grades of paint. 
*Like other paint stores, they can match other name brand colors. The trim of our home was a specific Sherwin Williams color that Dunn-Edwards had the formula in their computer.

Cons:
*Color matching takes a minimum of 1.5 hours. The stated reason for this lengthy time is that they not only do the computer matching like Home Depot, but they also have the tech eyeball samples to make sure it is as close as possible to what you are matching.
*Even when you are re-ordering paint with their reorder card or ordering a formula already in the computer, it still takes about 20 minutes to mix up your order. Oddly enough, they don't have anywhere for customers to sit while waiting.
*They do not automatically offer stuff you will need--like stir sticks. On my third visit I requested a 5 gallon stir stick and was told that they were out of them. I don't understand how a paint store that sells 5 gallon paint would run out of 5 gallon stir sticks.
*They do not follow industry standard names for gloss levels. For the trim color I asked for a satin gloss level and they do not use that name--they hand you a card with 7 levels of gloss. I picked ""low sheen"" as it looked closest to the satin already on the house trim.
*Grossly underestimated the amount of paint needed. When provided with the square footage and the fact that we were doing 2 coats of paint, the recommended amount of paint only did half the job (1 coat instead of 2) making additional trips back to the store necessary.
*Price---as everyone else has mentioned, this is one of the most expensive paints on the market. The price will be worth it if it lasts longer and does not fade, chip or peal, so only time will tell."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"My family used to shop Target all the time, but only shop specific advertised items now. 
Here are some of the reasons that Target has dropped off my routine shopping circuit:

*Since they closed their garden centers, you can no longer park close to where you plan on making purchases in the store. This is difficult for the mobility impaired who then have to traipse through the entire huge space of this big box store to get what they need.
*Checkout lanes are understaffed. Lines get absurdly long. Again, this is worse now that the garden centers have closed. The check out in the garden center took some of the pressure off of the main checkout lanes.
*Target used to have great clearance sales with 75% off of clearance items. The ""clearance"" shelves are now packed with merchandise that is 15-30% off full retail price. Heck, that doesn't even qualify as a decent ""sales"" price, let alone a ""clearance"" price.
*Today I left again empty handed. I tried to buy 4 items in their weekly ad. They were out of all 4 items.
*The quality of Target items has declined over time. It used to be that Target was priced between Walmart and department stores like Sears and JC Penneys and had products that were more in the department store quality. Most products are now Walmart quality. One example is 12 mid-priced towels that I bought at Target that totally unraveled the first time I washed them (before using them for the first time). When I returned them the customer service rep stated that the same thing had happened to her when she purchased these towels.
*Employees had about 1/3 of the aisles blocked with boxes for restocking the shelves (why the heck can't they do this before the customers are in the store?).
*Let's not forget the ""joy"" of identity theft generated by their massive data breach that they waited months to alert the public and victims to.
*One of the reasons for visiting this store today is that their web site states that this store has a photo center. Ha! Ha! Fooled me. What they have is a self-serve kiosk and no one to help you if you run into problems. I ended up going to Walgreens to get my photo work done. Interestingly, it was less expensive to get my 12 photo enlargements at Walgreens due to a flyer discount of 33% on all photo enlargements--PLUS I got personal, HUMAN assistance.

Sigh, another decent store goes down the drain."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Pros: Nice new facility. Ample parking compared to most East Valley hospitals.
Cons: Switchboard problematic. Called to speak to my daughter after she gave birth. The main number rang 22 times before it was answered. Switchboard then transferred me to her room which only disconnected me instead. Called back and waited another 20 rings and then switchboard transferred me to a number that was an automated reporting line for facilities issues instead of my daughter's room. Hung up. Went online and finally found a phone number for OB. The OB nurse transferred me to a room that rang endlessly with no one answering. Hung up. Called OB back and found out that my daughter had been transferred to another room and was transferred to that number. At last, I spoke with my daughter. Sigh.

My daughter was having her 4th baby. She had previously had babies at St. Joes, Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn, and Chandler Regional. The nursing care here was on a par with the other hospitals. The real issue here is that she was past her due date and her doctor decided on a Monday that she needed to be induced. This OB unit stated that they were too busy to induce her then, but scheduled her for a 9am induction the next morning. At 8am the OB department called and said they were still too busy to do the induction, but please standby as it could be a few minutes to a few hours to be called in for this procedure. My daughter called in every few hours and they were still too busy. So ended Tuesday. Wednesday was the same story. Thursday was the same story. Thursday evening my daughter became alarmed when there was a decrease in fetal movements. Called the doctor and started drinking juice to ""wake the baby up."" In the early hours of Friday morning she started contracting and went to the hospital and delivered in a few hours. 

I worked many years as an OB nurse myself and it was not unusual to delay an induction by a few hours due to a busy Labor and Delivery department, but never for 5 days! Not only was this incredibly stressful for my daughter and her husband, but she and her husband both missed a week's worth of work (for a total of two extra unplanned weeks without pay--try fitting that into your budget), AND her other 3 children had to stay with an out-of-town relative so they would be ready to head to the hospital at a moment's notice (this resulted in her 8 year old son missing an entire week of third grade). 

I am not sure if this unheard of delay in care is due to inadequate staffing or a lack of physical facility. Either way, the ""Meh, I've experienced better"" rating is accurate."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"I received a gift certificate for my birthday to this movie house. I went online to reserve my seat for the next day for ""Once Upon A Time In Hollywood."" I registered for their Victory rewards program and went step by step through the reservation process. It said my seat/order was confirmed and that the ticket price and convenience fee had been deducted from my gift card. However, there was a button at the bottom of the page that was grayed out and I thought that was weird so I printed out my ticket. 
The next day I went to the theater 30 minutes before the movie was slated to start and went to the ticket counter to confirm that what I printed out was the actual ticket. NO. It was not a ticket and someone else had now reserved my selected seat. The cost of the ticket had not been deducted from my gift certificate, so I chose another seat in the same row (only the first 3 rows have the reclining seats). She saw that I qualified for the senior ticket and since I was now buying the ticket at the theater I was able to forgo the convenience fee. These two things saved me $4 for my ticket (but I later learned that it did not count toward a reward in their rewards program).
As others have mentioned, the theater is kept very dark, even during the 30 minutes from the time customers are allowed to enter the theater until the time when the movie starts (no one is admitted after the official start time of the movie). One person in my row fell hard down some steps and looked pretty shaken up and possible badly hurt. The no phone and no talking rule does not seem well enforced and it is problematic having employees walking between you and the screen to take food orders, deliver food and toward the end of movie to give you your food receipt.
The movie video and sound quality was average for first run movies. The selection of films to be shown is a cross between an art film theater and a standard theater. There is a bar in the lobby and alcohol can be purchased in the theater. I had the Greek chicken salad. It was average in taste and size for an entree salad and would cost between $6-$10 at any restaurant in the Valley but costs $12.50 here. I did not buy any of the overpriced beverages. I get it. Movie theaters have always used food concessions as the money maker for their business (just look at what they charge for popcorn), but I now know that I need to eat BEFORE coming for a movie.
Parking is very tight and it is a moderate walk to the theater entrance for the mobility impaired. The theater is appropriately air conditioned and the bathrooms and theater itself are very clean. I will use the rest of my gift card, but I think that I actually prefer Cinemark to this quirky theater."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"Shopped this Safeway this morning. This is not my usual Safeway, but the one I usually go to on Main and Dobson is almost unreachable due to the City of Mesa doing road work on that corner for the last several months.
This store is on Alma School and Guadalupe with parking close to the door. It is a clean store, well stocked, and the employees are helpful, even though they rarely have enough checkout help. This morning at 6:45am they were backed up about 6 customers deep before they called for extra cashiers. Safeway shelf prices are about the same as other national chains located here in the valley.
One thing I really like about Safeway is that you can load the weekly ad specials on to your Safeway card and not have to clip the coupons. They also have weekly ""personalized specials"" you can load on your card based on trying to undercut other local grocery stores. Based on the comparisons they make on these specials, it looks like these items are purposely priced lower than Walmart. 
One Safeway feature you should check out is the $5 Friday deals. They can be found in the weekly ad and if you load them on your Safeway card they are good all weekend. They frequently run ads for additional discounts if you make a large purchase. This morning I got a coupon for $10 off of my next order because today's order was over $75. I routinely save 45-55% off the shelf prices using these electronic coupons, discounts, and specials.
You can also generate a list of all your coupons, deals, and items you checked off from the weekly flyer online. They have a computer and printer next to the customer service desk for you to print out your list there if you haven't already done it at home. They have a very nice Android app where you can do these things as well (I am assuming they also have an iOS one as well, but since I don't use Apple stuff I can't be sure).
I have used the pharmacy a number of times and the pharmacists seem pretty sharp. I get my annual flu shots here at no cost (paid for at 100% by my insurance company) plus they give you a discount on your grocery order for getting the flu shot here.
The deli always seems on top of things and feature the Primo Taglia meats that my family prefers to the Boar's Head brand some other local stores carry.
The produce department tends to have more US and local produce than many other chains and the bakery offers some very nice treats. Safeway also offers home delivery. We haven't used that service yet, but it is nice to know that it is there if you need it. You can use all your electronic coupons and discounts for home delivery as well.
Overall, Safeway has been on the leading edge of the consumer friendly shopping trends and has become one of my favorite grocery stores over the last year or so."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"1/12/17 Update: Continuing to have problems with TruWest--especially their credit card. Twice in the last 3 years the credit card department has lost my check payment. The first time they tried to blame the postal service stating that it must have been lost in the mail. Since this is the second time, I am starting to wonder if they are having problems with processing check payments. I pay my credit card in full each month within 24 hours of receiving my statement. I have done this for many years and never carry a balance. I called them right away when I got this statement, but they cannot even check on this until I go to the credit union branch to see if my check cleared (which is very odd since this was a Truwest check written to a Truwest credit card). I did that and it had not (it wouldn't if they lost it again). So I immediately wrote them another check and mailed it in. By the next day I was getting phone calls from their collections department (you have got to be kidding) and the statement wasn't even due for another 26 days! See below for some of the other major issues with TruWest over the last several years.

I have already moved a large amount of my accounts to another financial institution and will probably close all of my accounts in the near future.

3/22/16 I have been a member of TruWest for many years--going back to when they were the Motorola Credit Union. There have been a couple of serious hiccups over the last year that have prompted me to open an account with another financial institution with the probability that I will move all, or some, of my accounts to another place.

*I went to deposit my tax refund checks last week and requested less than 10% of the refund back and the teller could not complete the transaction because ""collections"" had placed a hold on my account. The only account I have with payments is my credit card which I pay off in full each month. It turns out that they had my account confused with another customer with a similar name who apparently was behind on their payments. They fixed the error and completed my transaction, but I now have no confidence that I can access my money when I need to because at any time some twerp in ""collections"" can freeze any credit union member's accounts without doing their due diligence to even make sure they have the right customer's account.

*In December 2015 Dan Desmond (President and CEO of TruWest) sent a letter to my husband advising him to get overdraft protection on his accounts. Unfortunately, my husband had died two years earlier. It is not like TruWest is unaware of this since I had to produce my husband's death certificate to close his accounts. When I called to inquire if perhaps an identity theft had occurred that someone had opened an account in my dead husband's name and maybe that is why this letter was generated. Customer service assured me that they would research this and get back to me within a few days. That was December and this is March and I still have not heard back from them."
l-B4axUNxQ9FVVxeQm8t2A,"7/1/2017 Update: I called AAA this morning to get a new battery. My 4 year old battery had failed the cold crank test at the dealer service department when they did their 23 point inspection and I had decided not to buy the dealer's battery. I was on hold for 20 minutes and finally hung up without speaking to an agent. This does NOT bode well for AAA service.

I finally went online and ordered my battery. You have to sign into their website (where the heck did I put that password?). They gave me an online estimate of the costs and the ETA was 60 minutes. I got an automated call about 30 minutes later telling me that the ETA was now 40-60 minutes from the order. The battery tech showed up 60 minutes after I placed the online order and 90 minutes from my first attempt to call/contact AAA. Like my AARP Allstate roadside assistance program, they sent a responder from Apache Junction instead of Tempe. This accounts for the lengthy response times.

7/2/2015
I am giving AAA Arizona one last chance. I just sent in my check and paperwork for 13 mos of roadside assistance for $57. I had been a AAA Arizona member a few years ago, but left them because the Classic plan (the affordable one) only offers a 5 mile tow. That will not get me across Tempe, let alone Phoenix or any trip outside of the valley. It is almost double or more the Classic plan fee ($97 for the Plus plan or $125 for the Premier plan) to get the 100 mile tow option. 

Here are some other reasons why I have not been a fan:
*Travel discounts are usually not a good deal. For example, I was able to book a Holiday Inn Express in Barstow, CA online from the Holiday Inn website for $84 per night with a 2 week advance purchase. The AAA price for the same night is $94. I have checked a half a dozen hotels that I commonly stay at and it is always less expensive to book directly with the hotel.
*The trip planning feature was helpful years ago, but now Mapquest and other online tools have pretty much replaced maps, and other trip planning services. Both my Allstate and AARP roadside assistance programs offered trip planning services as well.
*Shopping and dining and other non-travel discounts can be had via AARP, credit cards, or other group affiliations or other roadside assistance programs, so they are not a big deal nor unique to AAA.

Here is what I am hoping for and what will raise AAA's rating:
*Response time. The reason why I left AAA's competitors and am giving AAA a second chance is that Allstate and AARP roadside assistance programs have routinely taken nearly 2 hours to respond to towing and battery jump requests. That is a long time in our AZ 110 degree heat. If AAA can deliver assistance in 30 minutes or less they will have a fan here! :-)
*AAA needs to realize that a 5 mile tow feature is unacceptable. It may work back east where it is just a few miles between towns, but in the Western US the distances between towns can be quite far. Just to drive from my Tempe home to a friend up in Sun City is 44 miles. Maybe they should offer a 50 mile tow option, not just a choice between 5 miles or 100 miles."

Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"Boodle Fight? I've heard of Kamayan Feast. Apparently, according to Google, this is a Filipino military tradition where the food is laid out on banana leaves across the table and diners eat with their hands. It's definitely communal dining. Kamayan, Filipino for ""eating with the hands"", is the same thing but maybe sounds more civilized. That's my understanding. Correct?

JK came across an offer for a Boodle date (two adults for $30). Having missed a few invitations for Kamayan, I was anxious to try this so we made a reservation for lunch.

We arrived at Dbarkadz all of their tables were occupied. Hmmm. There were only four tables near the front of the place, near the door. The rest of the space was set up like a store, with a service counter and steam table towards the back. Where were we going to sit.

The proprieters realised that we were there for a reservation and invited us to sit in their basement dining room. It looks like they host larger groups down there, and karaoke parties. We had the entire space to ourselves for our ""date"".

The food was presented on banana leaves laid out on a full-sized (large) sheet pan. Wow! Impressive looking! Hmmm, that's a lot of food. How are we going to finish this? Anyway, first things first, pictures! The overall presentation was impressive but there were so many components that deserved some attention of their own.

Pictures out of the way, we gloved up and dug in. There was fish (tilapia and milkfish), rice, noodles, mango, cuttlefish, eggplant, bitter melon, chicken, several pork dishes, and more!

I'm not a huge fan of fish, especially tilapia, and I've never had milkfish. They were stuffed with onions and tomatoes and grilled. Not bad. The cuttlefish was battered and fried, also not bad. The noodles, curry chicken and bitter melon were good. The pork dishes were our favourite, especially the crispy skin and the BBQ skewers. Yummy!

There was no way we were going to finish this food. It was too much! JK packed a takeout box and there was still enough left on the tray for another meal. We enjoyed the food and the experience. The staff (Owners? Managers?) were very friendly.  At $15/person, it's a great value! Make sure you come hungry!"
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I was happy to see Jatujak open a location in North Scarborough, a little more convenient for me to get to, compared to their other locations. I've enjoyed the food at their Victoria Park location. I dragged along a couple of friends who were new to Jatujak. It didn't take much convincing because they love Thai food and they both know good food.

From the outside, it looks like they took over two units in the plaza. One unit has a nice facade and signage for Jatujak but their entrance is on the other unit which has remnants of the signage from the previous business. It's a little confusing. Once inside, the decor is tastefully done, with wood and (faux) brick walls. Some of the walls have large murals depicting Thai culture and scenes from Thailand. Wooden floors and a mixture of high and low tables with metal chairs complete the casual decor.

One side of their menu offers Lunch Specials (11:00am - 3:00pm), Desserts, and Beverages, including beer and wine. The other side of the menu has Appetizers, Salads, Soups, Stir-fry, Noodles & Rice, Curry dishes, and Side Orders.  This is where we ordered from.

We started with the Papaya Salad with Salted Eggs, and then Jatujak Pad Thai with Beef, Gaeng Kiew Whan (green curry) with Chicken, and Holy Basil with Egg and Pork.

The papaya salad was very good. It had a depth of flavours - tangy, sweet, savoury, salty. We all enjoyed it.

At first taste, the pad thai was a bit sweet and it had very bold flavours. Squeezing the lime over it balanced it out quite nicely. The beef could have been more tender. Maybe I'll order it with chicken next time.

The green curry was nice, although we would have preferred it a little thicker. I know this is the way it's supposed to be but we prefer thicker sauces and gravies. It had very good flavour. Maybe it could have used a splash of colour with a red chili or red and yellow peppers?

The holy basil with ground pork was our favourite dish. It had the most flavour and was perhaps the simplest dish to prepare.

Overall, we really enjoyed the food. Some attention was paid to plating and presentation, with the papaya salad being the most attractive. The space is roomy and clean and the service was good. We'll be back!"
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"A fellow foodie recommended Jerkup Central and I had never heard of it before so I had to investigate.

They are located in a small industrial plaza on Brimley, north of Sheppard. They have seating for less than 20 diners, with most of their business being takeout and catering. Looking past the service counter reveals a huge kitchen plus another area where they smoke the foods. The back of house space looks to be easily four to five times large than the front of house.

What makes this place different from most Jamaican/Caribbean restaurants is their claim to offer healthier choices. To support this claim, they make all their own seasonings, with a lower salt content and all natural ingredients. Their marinades are bottled and available for purchase at the counter. They use chickens that are grain fed and locally grown.

Their daily menu offers Jerk Chicken, Jerk Pork, BBQ Chicken, Stew Chicken, Curry Chicken, and Fish. The fish has to be ordered two hours in advance. Weekly specials include a different soup every day, Curry Goat on Wednesdays, Cow Foot on Thursdays, and Oxtail on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays only.

My companion and I ordered small plates of Jerk Pork, Oxtail, and Stew Chicken in order to sample a few dishes. They were all served with Rice & Peas and a Veggie Medley (steamed).

Our plates arrived with generous portions of rice & peas and veggies and a decent amount of proteins (for small orders).

The jerk pork looked good, with a nice smoke ring around the edges. It tasted okay but it was dry and the seasoning hadn't penetrated the meat as much as the smoke. They probably used a leaner, ""healthier"" cut of meat instead of a more marbled (fattier) cut. Some gravy would have probably improved this dish (for me).

The stew chicken, with an ample amount of gravy, was also okay and appeared to be all skinless dark meat.

The oxtail was our favourite dish. It was the most flavourful of the three and tender enough to come off the bone easily.

Overall, I admire their efforts to offer healthier cooking but I would have to describe the taste as average. I've had better and I've had worse but I don't know if I've had healthier (from a Caribbean restaurant). The service was friendly."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"Some friends of mine wanted to try Beryl's so I tagged along with them. Third visit in ten days. Hey, I like their food.

With five of us, we ordered a variety of dishes. We started with the Ackee and Saltfish Spring Rolls, Saltfish Fritters, and Red Peas Soup (of the day). They were all good, especially the ackee spring rolls. There was a generous amount of tasty filling. The fritters could have used a little more saltfish (and maybe another fritter).

On to the mains. The Curry Goat and Oxtail were as good as on my previous visits. Consistency is a good thing.

The Escoveitch Red Snapper was served whole, with rice and peas and coleslaw. It was the prettiest dish of the evening, very colourful with pickled peppers. It tasted good and was also a good portion because some of it ended up in a takeout box.

The fried chicken was crispy and I was offered a choice of gravy for the rice and peas. I chose oxtail gravy. Good choice! The chicken, however, was a little on the dry side.

One friend enjoyed the red peas soup so much, he ordered another bowl for his main course.

For dessert, we had Rum and Raisin ice cream and a very generous slice of Sweet Potato Pudding that we shared. Very good on both counts. We were very happy with the taste of all the food.

The service (attentiveness) has definitely improved since my first visit. Our appetizers came out fairly quickly but the mains took a little while and the food temperature could have been hotter. They did have a full dining room and a steady flow of customers at the takeout counter but that shouldn't affect our orders.

The menu is a little confusing. Some items had a choice of preparation listed under it that may get missed. For example, under Whole Red Snapper, there is a choice of Escovietch, Brown Stew or Steamed Fish, in a smaller font. Under Chicken Breast, there is a choice of Jerk, Stew or Island Style Fried Chicken. I actually got thighs (which I preferred).

Chef Beryl visited our table to say hello and get some feedback. I like that touch.

Disclaimer: Three reviews in ten days may seem unusual. For the record, I have no affiliation with this restaurant, their ownership, or employees. I simply like their food and their location is very convenient for me."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"Wow, this place has come a long way since I last played here! I'm not even sure how long I've been playing golf but it must be at least thirty years and this is one of the courses I learned on. Of course, back then, before anybody ever heard of ClubLink, this golf course was known as Gormley Green. It was cheap and the conditions were reasonable (for the time). There was barely a clubhouse and, if I recall, hardly any food.

Fast forward to yesterday, after fifteen or more years of ownership under ClubLink and a name change to Station Creek, I returned to have lunch and play a round of golf. A lot has changed, mostly to the clubhouse. It's new, compared to when I last played here.

The clubhouse now houses a well stocked pro shop, a large restaurant with a good sized patio, and a banquet room. The parking lot is well partitioned and treed. There is a new halfway house between nines on the North Course course, right by the parking lot. I don't remember there being a driving range here before but there is one now, although it looks like it's seen better days.

Although it's been a very long time since I've played here, the course layout did seem familiar. I remembered most of the holes. Some of these trees, of course, seemed a lot bigger and more plentiful. I don't remember there being so many bunkers though. I found several of them. Darn. The course conditions were a lot better than I remember. With this being a private club now, that's to be expected. I will say that the course has matured very well since I last played it.

I did have lunch in the clubhouse before playing and it was a good meal. I had the Chicken Clubhouse Sandwich with a Caesar Salad and it was very enjoyable. It wasn't the typical double-decker sandwich cut into quarters but just two slices of bread with the ingredients between them. The Caesar salad was good. 
It was a good meal but the staff were a bit slow in clearing tables. The table I really wanted to sit at wasn't cleared properly before I arrived and remained in that state when I left. There was only one other table occupied in this section. It could have been cleared.

Overall, it was an enjoyable day. It was nice to return to a course I hadn't played at in over fifteen years. Maybe I'll have to come back."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"My exploration of new restaurants brought us to Azyun, suggested by JK. It's a cozy space with seating for about 30 diners (my guesstimate). The decor is modern and chic, very nice.

The menu is small but interesting and they had a few specials for the day. The dishes being served at nearby tables all looked good so it took us a while to settle on the Confit Duck Biang Biang Noodles, Lamb Ribs, and the Crab Sticky Rice (one of the specials).

While waiting for our order, we started with some cocktails, the Shanghai Sling (gin, cherry brandy, orange, lychee, lime, bitters) for JK and Crouching Tiger (bourbon, gin, ginger beer, orange, lime) for me. The Crouching Tiger had a sharp bite from the ginger beer but it was nicely balanced. Checking into Yelp revealed an offer of any bar rail drink for $5 so I later had a Whisky Sour that was also quite good.

The duck arrived first, very nicely presented. It tasted as good as it looked, maybe even better. Stirring the poached egg into the rest of the ingredients blended the flavours and textures quite nicely.

The lamb was also very attractively presented, with the Asian pear salad next to it on a long plate. The meat was deliciously seasoned and tender, probably as a result of being slow-cooked for ten hours. The pear salad balanced the fat of the lamb very well.

The crab sticky rice was wrapped in a lotus leaf and served in a bamboo steam basket, dim sum style. It was a good dish but the crab flavour was a bit subtle for my taste. I would probably try one of the other dishes before ordering this again.

By design, the portions aren't ""meal sized"" but more like large tapas plates. That left us wanting a little more. Hmmm, fried chicken or bone marrow (special of the day)?

The chicken was popular at nearby tables so we chose that. It was very crunchy on the outside and the meat was tender and juicy. It was actually a little too crunchy. The batter tended to crack and fall off. The chili mayo was a nice complement but would have been a more effective dip in a portion cup, rather than on the plate. Nitpicking.

Overall it was a very good experience. The cocktails were on point. The duck and lamb were excellent, while the crab and chicken were very good. The service was excellent. I'll be back."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"Jollibee seems to have a very loyal following, mostly from Toronto's Filipino community. After waiting in line for 38 minutes, I still don't know what all the fuss is about. I just had to satisfy my curiosity.

They have a good system for managing the line of people waiting to get in. There are barricades and stancions set up in the parking lot to keep things orderly. Umbrellas are provided for rain or heat. Staff walk the lines providing menus and pre-orders. Once inside, however, there's another line to submit your order and pay. They give you a pager to call you when your order is ready. When they just opened, in the winter, they had two large tents in the parking lot to accommodate the masses.

We ordered a 2-piece spicy chicken with buttered corn, gravy, and pineapple juice; a Yum burger combo with fries and soda; and a peach mango pie.

The chicken was very good, crispy and juicy, better than many other fast food fried chicken I've had. It was dusted with some chili powder for the spicy aspect. Unfortunately, everything else was disappointing.

The buttered corn was a little overcooked for my liking.

I don't know where the gravy fit into this. Was it for the chicken, the corn, or one of the other side options?

The pineapple juice was good - very sweet at first sip but just right once the ice had melted a bit.

The fries could have benefited from a few minutes longer in the fryer. They were pale and not as crispy as they could/should have been.

I'm not a big fan of peaches but I was coerced into trying the peach mango pie. The pastry was deliciously crispy but I found the filling too sweet and artificially flavoured. I wasn't really able to discern peach or mango flavour and I love mango.

The Yum burger. Let's talk about the burger. It reminded me of that commercial from 1984, ""Where's the beef?"". How many of you remember that? The size of the patty in this burger was miniscule. I mean really flat. Other than the sweet sauce, it had no flavour. It was bad, really awful, and should be removed from the menu. Seriously. It's memorable only because of how bad it is. Don't order it. Trust me!

If you're craving for some good fried chicken, they have that here. Everything else was just meh. Would I line up for 30+ minutes again just for chicken. No."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"Some friends were performing at a venue not known for great food (in my opinion and experience) so I consulted my trusty Yelp app for somewhere to have dinner and found Uncle Mikey's. With a five star rating, an Asian Fusion menu, and only steps from our destination, it was definitely worth exploring.

My dining companions arrived shortly before I did and ordered a few items from the happy hour menu as starters.

The Onigiri (Japanese Rice Ball), served with mayo and wasabi, was a ball of rice crisped up on a griddle. As simple as that sounds, it was tasty.

The chicken wings weren't as crispy as they looked but had a nice flavour and the pickled chayote was nice.

The soy egg, perfectly cooked just short of hard boiled, was marinated in soy and topped with cracked pepper and green onions. Simple. Tasty.

I'm not a fan of cucumbers but my companions really liked the smashed cucumber dish, topped with Korean spices (Gochujang sauce?) and peanuts. I tried it and it did have a nice flavour. I still don't like cucumbers.

The kimchi pancake was our favourite of the apps. Again, very simple but full of flavour.

For something more substantial, we ordered the Kimchi Bowl with Pork Belly, Oxtail Gnocchi, and Pork Katsu. We also added the Starving Artist, a bowl of egg noodles in peanut sauce.

The Kimchi Bowl had a lot of ingredients but we all found it a little bland. Mixing everything together made it better but we still expected bolder flavours from a dish with kimchi. Not bad though.

I grew up on Jamaican style oxtail, with rich deep flavours, so I didn't love this version with the gnocchi. It wasn't a bad dish but it's not the flavours I'm used to. The presentation was nice but the portion was a tad small for the price.

The Pork Katsu was pretty good. The pork was nicely cooked and the purple cabbage slaw had a nice flavour. Good portion.

Our server described the Starving Artist as a fun dish and, at only $5, it was a pleasant surprise. We actually enjoyed this very much.

Overall, the food was pretty good. Some of the dishes were interesting but I would have to say we enjoyed the simpler ones more. The service was also very good and all the staff were friendly. I would do this again.

Note: This is probably not the place for people with a peanut allergy."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"May Yan Seafood Restaurant is one of the newest Chinese restaurants in Scarborough. It takes the place of one of my favourite Chinese restaurants that occupied this space previously. It looks and feels like the previous place but they gave up an adjoining unit to another business.

My cousin chose this place to celebrate his Dad's birthday. I have to say it was a good choice! The food was excellent! The menu seems familiar, almost the same as the previous place. It's probably the same chefs.

Our dishes included Lobster with Ginger and Green Onions, Steamed Sea Bass with Ginger and Green Onions, Deep Fried Chicken, Eggplant with Salted Fish, Beef with Broccoli in Bird's Nest (taro), Eggplant with Salted Fish in Hot Pot, and Sauteed Snow Peas Leaves with Garlic.

Our delicious meal started with complimentary house soup and ended with a warm green bean dessert, also complimentary.

The chicken was moist, crispy, flavourful, and very enjoyable.

The beef was tender and tasty while the broccoli was perfectly cooked and the taro nest was also very crispy.

The snow peas leaves were also very tasty, with lots of garlic, and perfectly cooked.

The fish was presented live at the table before being cooked. Although it needed some salt, it was very good.

The lobster was also presented live at our table before being cooked. Although I'm allergic to lobster, everybody else obviously enjoyed it to the last piece.

The eggplant, presented in a sizzling hot pot, looked good but is another dish that I don't care for. Everybody else enjoyed it.

I was looking for one of the signature dishes from the previous business, boneless whole Deep Fried Chicken Stuffed with Rice and Chinese Sausages, but I didn't see it on the menu. I did however see another diner post a picture of it. I'll have to go back and look again.

One of the drawbacks, for me, was a language barrier. Only one server spoke English (barely), and none of us spoke Chinese. Most of our ordering was done by pointing at items in the menu, listed in both English and Chinese. There are lots of menu items posted on the walls but in Chinese only. I'm not sure if we missed out on ordering anything else.

Despite the language difference, the service was very good and all the food tasted really good. I'll definitely be back!"
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I drive past this place all the time on my way to my chiropractor and hair stylist. Way back in the day, it used to be Chi-Chi's Mexican restaurant, and then a Chinese buffet or two, and now Scarborough Buffet, Chinese. I stopped in for lunch mostly out of curiosity. Nobody has ever recommended this place to me so I came in with very low expectations. It turned out to be better than I expected.

The decor was tastefully done, with lots of red, even the ceiling. The chairs were solidly built wood. The buffet stations were positioned to allow a decent flow of traffic. It looks like they have two dining rooms, one open to the buffet and the other with its own doors for private events up to 150 diners.

As I usually do at buffet restaurants, I started with soup and salad. I chose the chicken and corn soup and it tasted good but was very thick (with corn starch). The salad bar had enough choices to satisfy me but, curiously, there was no lettuce or any other leafy greens. The mango salad had a nice flavour but the mangoes could have been peeled better. It still had some skin.

There were a few dishes that I don't normally see at other Chinese buffet restaurants. They include pig's feet, bitter melon with beef, and pork bone soup with corn on the cob and Chinese radish. These weren't bad but the bitter melon could have been cooked a little more. Some pieces were a bit crunchy.

The rest of the food was decent but there were too many choices for me to try everything. I never made it to the grill or sushi station. The sushi looked tiny and they weren't quite keeping up with the demand.

The service was very good, with several servers checking on me and clearing plates quite efficiently.

The diners were very diverse, with almost every complexion and culture represented. A lot of them appeared to be blue collar workers on their lunch break. They were in and out in a hurry. There was an elderly couple who were reusing their plates instead of taking new ones at the buffet stations, and a couple of young girls causing a traffic jam by eating off their plates while serving themselves from the buffet. Pay attention girls. Keep it moving.

Overall, it was a good experience, worthy of repeating. There were some dishes that I wanted to try but was too stuffed. Maybe I'll skip the soup and salad next time."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I love shawarma and I've been to Osmow's before, albeit a different location. This location is newer, bigger, and more modern. It has bright colours, and lots of electronic signage for menus, etc. Although the food tasted okay, the rest of the experience was a bit annoying.

It was loud! There was a constant clanging of metal on metal with the cooks banging metal spatulas against the grill to chop up the meats they were cooking. There was a doorbell chime every few minutes. All of trhis contibuted to some miscommunication and missed communication.

Orders are placed at the counter  and they take your name to call you when it's ready. My friends had already ordered and paid and I ordered the Osmow's Mixed Grill (Mix of chicken shawarma, a skewer of lamb kofta, chicken kebab, and Osmow's Special chicken with pineapple all grilled together with sautéed green peppers and onions and sauced to perfection with our famous Osmow's sauces and your choice of two sides). I chose rice and Greek salad (with no cucumbers ) as my sides. The server said this would take 12-15 minutes to prepare. How many of these could they serve?

My friends were already eating their Chicken on the Stix. It's really just chicken shawarma on fries with the house sauces. Chicken on the Rocks is rice instead of fries. Confusing names. It was a large serving but the flavour was a bit bland.

I never heard my name called over the ambient noise but my order was ready. It was a very generouse serving of meat over rice, with the salad in a separate container. Despite my request, there were cucumbers in the salad, and not enough dressing. Suppose I was allergic to cucumbers?

This meat had more flavour than the other dish but it was hard to tell what we were eating. Everything was chopped up and piled on top of the rice and covered with sauces, making it all look the same. The sauces, while tasty, made everything kinda taste the same. This was not as enjoyable as anticipated. I took most of it home.

Their presentation needs a lot of work. Everything is served in takeout containers, piled on top of each other and covered in sauces, unlike all the photos on display in the store. Those were nicely plated on real plates with each item distinguishable from the other.

As much as I like shawarma, these issues make this location a no-fly zone for me."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I've been to this restaurant three times since discovering it recently and this is my first chance to write a review. Three times? Needless to say, I like it!

The food is very tasty and the dishes remind me of the type of home cooking I grew up with. The dishes that I've had so far have been more authentic Hakka style, not the Indo-Hakka style that's become popular all over Toronto.

They also offer Thai and Cantonese dishes but the Combo part of the menu is what appeals to me most. That's where I found the dishes that got me drooling. It's also cheap! A single dish is 11.75 but if you order two, it's 20.95, three for 30.95, and so on. That includes rice and soup of the day.

On my first visit, three of us ordered Tofu with Salted Fish and Chicken in Hot Pot, Braised Beef Brisket with Turnip in Hot Pot, and Choy Sum with Garlic. We also couldn't resist ordering BBQ Duck with E-Fu noodles from another section of the menu.

Everything was served quickly and steaming hot! The soup was a simple broth with some greens (kale?). The chicken dish was delicious, not too salty. The beef dish was very tender and tasty. The greens were cooked perfectly. The noodle dish was very good.

On my next visit, I treated an aunt for her 80th birthday. We ordered the Pork Belly with Preserved Vegetable and Chicken in Hot Pot. The soup today had corn and mushrooms, delicious. The pork belly was very tender and full of flavour. The chicken dish included mushrooms and Chinese sausage, unexpected but very welcome. These are my favourite dishes so far!

On my most recent visit, we ordered dishes that we haven't tried here before. The oxtail was tender and very tasty. The deep fried squid was crispy and flavourful. The green beans with ground pork was tasty but I would have preferred a slightly drier version.

Overall, I really enjoy this style of Chinese food. It's simple and down to earth. The flavours definitely reminded me of foods I grew up with.

The restaurant itself is simple, almost a hole in the wall. It's located on a side street that probably doesn't get much traffic. There's nothing fancy about the decor. Handwritten signs with daily specials are posted on the walls.

It's not close to home but I'm always in the area visiting friends. This is probably going to be our go-to restaurant for Chinese food. Delicious and cheap!"
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I went to Gyu-Kaku to take advantage of their soft opening special of 20% off all their BBQ courses. It's not all you can eat but you can order set courses, depending on your craving and hunger level.

I believe we got the Samurai package for four. At $125, it included soup, salad, rice, noodles, eight kinds of meat, veggies, dessert, and more - 19 different items in total. We also got an order of bibimbap as part of a separate special offer. It was enough food for four of us plus a young child.

The non-grilled starter items arrived first - soup, salad, edamame, tofu, etc. The noodle and rice dishes arrived separately and were stirred and served tableside. The meats arrived, one or two at a time, and were presented with cooking recommendations. The cuts of meat looked very good.

There is also a printed grilling guide with the same detailed recommendations presented by our server. It suggests what part of the grill to use for each type of meat (or veggie) and how long to cook it for. Less experienced cooks should be able to get good results. Maybe. Hopefully.

The thinner cuts of beef cooked in under two minutes and the thicker pieces in three minutes in the center of the grill. Poultry, pork, and seafood took up to ten minutes around the perimeter. Veggies were around six minutes, also around the edges.

For dessert, we had a choice of ice cream or S'Mores. I had the lime sorbet and it was tart but very good. The S'Mores were served deconstructed and we had to toast the marshmallows over the grill before assembling the final product. It was a good interactive dessert.

In addition to the packages, Gyu-Kaku has an a la carte menu with lots of choices. You can have a meal here without having to cook it yourself.

The service throughout the evening was excellent. Our server was very friendly and attentive and had support from other servers.

Overall, this was a very good experience. Everything that we ate tasted very good but the beef was our favourite, all the cuts. It's hard to beat the taste of grilled beef. None of the flavours fell short.

My only reservation is the cost. I'm not saying it's expensive or unreasonable but the price approaches similar places that offer all you can eat. it's not exactly comparing apples to apples because of the additional choices here but it may be a tough call the next time I feel for Japanese BBQ."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"My lunch buddy, Raj, had a craving for Indian food, buffet style. We like trying different restaurants, so a search through Yelp, Google, and other social media produced a short list within a reasonable proximity. We decided on Mayur Fine Indian Cuisine at Ellesmere and Pharmacy, in Scarborough.

Mayur is located in an older plaza with several other restaurants, including Hakka Chinese, Sushi, and Pizza. The parking lot is pretty tight, with very few spots, compared to the potential seating in all the restaurants. The buffet is located near the entrance, making it easy to decide if it's appealing enough to stay for lunch.

The steam table had fifteen items, including the always popular butter chicken, tandoori chicken, curry goat, chickpeas, saag paneer, and more. There was a handwritten sign at one end of the buffet that said something about ""love food"", ""don't waste it"", or something like that. That explains the size of the small plates. I have no problems with the message. I hate to see food go to waste. I would have preferred a larger plate.

The food tasted good. I particularly liked the butter chicken, curry goat, and saag paneer (spinach and cheese). The veggie pakora and onion bhaji were just slightly on the dry side. I imagine they would have been much better if they had just come out of the kitchen. The rest of the food was very good. My grumpy friend wasn't so enthusiastic. Did I mention he was grumpy? 

For the second day in a row, a server spilled something on me and all over the table. This time, it was a bottle of beer. At least she was genuinely apologetic, a bit embarrassed, and made a good effort to clean up the mess, unlike last night. She did bring a new bottle of beer but she forgot a water glass.

As we became more aware of our environment, we realized none of the lights in the restaurant were turned on. There was a lot of light coming in through the front windows but the back of the room was kinda dark. It made table-side photography a little bit more challenging. I think they also forgot to turn on the air conditioning. I was sweating a lot! The heat from the steam table didn't help. Maybe they turned off the lights to lower the heat. Their debit/credit terminal wasn't working, making cash the only payment they could accept.

The food deserves a higher rating but the issues mentioned above were too much to ignore."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I had the pleasure of playing in a tournament on Angus Glen's South Course, host of many corporate tournaments, including The Canadian Open, and more recently, the World Junior Girls Tournament. I also co-hosted a small golf tournament, two days prior. The weather, on both days, was a contrast of extremes.

On Sunday, the day of my tournament, it was a lot cooler than anticipated. A couple of days later, in the tournament I played in, the temperature was a record high for October 1st. We enjoyed the warmth and blue skies while playing but it poured shortly after! It POURED!

On both days, the (South) course conditions were excellent, probably a reflection of the recent World Junior Girls Tournament. Lucky for us! The greens and fairways were well manicured and the pace of play was good.

On Sunday, the staffing was very low, resulting in a few complaints from our players. The halfway house was closed and most of our players never saw the lone beverage cart making its rounds. Had they known, they probably would have had something from the Silo Grill prior to playing. The service, dinner after the round, and overall experience, mostly made up for it.

Tuesday's round started with a variety of breakfast options, with something for everybody. Each player also received a $100 gift card for use in the Pro Shop. Yay!

With this being a much larger tournament, using both courses, the staffing was a lot better. From dropping off my golf bag, registering, starting the tournament, and even finishing, it was a really good experience. The GPS screen on the golf carts kept us informed on course conditions and even some impending bad weather towards the end of our round.

There were food and beverage stations on the course, provided by sponsors, and the beverage carts were out making the rounds. Everything was complimentary! Yay!

Following the round, there was a reception and prizing in the Great Hall. There were several food stations, offering something for everybody. It was all good!

It was a very well organized and enjoyable event. Angus Glen was a great venue. The golf course, hospitality service, and all the staff really delivered!

Disclaimer: I worked at Angus Glen for ten years, ending over three years ago. I still have friends working there but this review is unbiased. Working and attending an event are two separate experiences. It was nice being a guest!"
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I had arranged to meet a friend and fellow foodie, Raj N., for dinner. We often try to explore and discover new places to eat. On this occasion, I was browsing through this area on Google Maps when I came across Lahore's Premium Kabab House, close to my old neighbourhood. Off we went.

Being our first time here, we ordered dishes that we're familiar with so we could compare to similar restaurants - Boneless Chicken Tikka Biryani, Butter Naan, and Butter Chicken. We also ordered the Lahori Beek Kabab, Sweet Lassi, Gulab Jamun (dessert), and extra chillies on the side.

The first dish to arrive was a small plate of lettuce, onions, and carrots, with a couple of portion cups with sauces. It wasn't really a composed salad. DIY garnish?

The rest of the food arrived shorlty after and looked really good. They were all served on hot cast iron plates sitting on wooden blocks. The beef kababs were still sizzling. Presentation was nice but not very practical. The rice was piled up high on the shallow vessel and spilled as soon as we dug in. The sauce from the butter chicken also spilled because it was filled to the brim.

Nitpicking aside, the food tasted delicious! The biryani rice was flavourful and fluffy, with generous amounts of tikka chicken throughout. The butter chicken was rich with flavour without being too spicy. The beef kababs were nicely seasoned and cooked. The freshly made naan were huge (we couldn't finish it) and had the right texture. The extra chillies were grilled and seasoned. Nice.

Unfortunately, the service didn't match the quality of the food. I'll give our server marks for effort but he was clearly inexperienced and didn't understand everything we said (language barrier?). When we were seated, he placed a pitcher of water, glasses, plates and cutlery, on the table in a pile. Not an uncommon practice at small restaurants. One of the glasses, however, was dirty and the replacement glass was also dirty. There were times when it seemed like he didn't understand what we were asking for, such as asking about dessert and asking for the bill. It may seem like more nitpicking but it affects the overall experience.

We were the last diners to leave and met the owner on our way out. We chatted for a while and he seems like a nice guy. He recommended we try the beef short ribs next time. Yes, there probably will be a next time.

Food: 4 / Service: 2"
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I've been to Smash a couple of times in the past few weeks for lunch and brunch. The food and service were good enough to put them on the short list when some old friends from high school wanted to get together for dinner. Tonight's experience warrants another review and elevation to five star status!

There were eleven of us, with almost everybody coming here for the first time. We were seated in a smaller, more intimate area that was quite cozy. A couple of friends, not related to our group, were seated in the same area a few minutes later. Oooh, was it their date night?

After a few drinks and getting reacquainted, we ordered our meals. Despite our last three guests arriving late, after we had started ordering, all the food came out at the same time, with the latecomers actually getting served first. The food came out of the kitchen a lot quicker than we anticipated. They were also able to tweak a couple of the dishes to satisfy some dietary preferences. Good job from the kitchen!

Our meals included MacnCheese, Paella, Pizza, Club Sandwich, Cobb Salad, Chicken and Ribs, Steak, and Cornish Hen. The presentation on all the dishes was really attractive (see photos). The taste was even better!

The Club Sandwich was served like a wrap, on naan. It certainly looked a lot better than the one I had for lunch earlier in the day and K said it was absolutely delicious. M was raving about his Chorizo Pizza right until the last crumb. L and T enjoyed the Paella and would probably have eaten the shells if they could. W performed a magic act by making his Steak disappear before setting his sights on P's Chicken and Ribs. My Piri Piri Cornish Hen was so good, I would have licked the plate! Everybody truly enjoyed their meals.

Although we were all stuffed, we just had to try their desserts. We had the Chocolate Bar (brownie, mousse, raspberry), Mango Sorbet, White Chocolate Raspberry Creme Brulee, and coffee. Sounds delicious? It was! Civility prevented us from licking the plates.

Our server, Nick, did an outstanding job! He was courteous, professional, efficient, and very patient. Our last guests arrived almost an hour late and we were the last ones to leave. Sorry, Nick.

Our group included couples that were high school sweethearts who have known each other for 40+ years. That's unusual these days. It was a great evening of friendship and good food. Smash provided the perfect setting. Bravo!"
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"A friend of mine suggested we meet for dinner after work at KOKO! Share Bar, a modern Korean Japanese restaurant in Yorkville, halfway between our offices. I wasn't familiar with Koko so I looked up their web site. The menu had a lot of choices but I was more interested in their Korean offerings. Prices were a little high but on par for Yorkville. We made reservations online.

It's a very small and cozy space below street level. Our table was at the back of the restaurant, right in front of the bar. Coat hangers were on the wall next to the bar. The table settings were simple and elegant, with the chopsticks in bamboo pencil-case type of box. Nice touch.

After looking over the menu, we started with Edamame (steamed soy beans - $6), Galbi Grilled Beef Short Ribs (marinated in garlic, soy, ginger, red wine, with steamed rice - $25), and Bulgogi (thinly sliced strips of marinated ribeye steak, assorted vegetables - $21). My companion had mentioned to our server that she doesn't care for peppers and I don't care for zucchini and our server acknowledged that.

The edamame arrived shortly after ordering. It could have used a few more grains of salt but it was okay.

The galbi was served on a bed of onions on a sizzling platter. The ribs had grill marks on them also. Looks good.

The bulgogi was served in a bowl and, although we mentioned our preference to not have peppers or zucchini, the only vegetable in there was carrots (and a ton of onions). Hmmm, surely they must have had some other kind of vegetables in the pantry, if not just for colour and presentation. Other dishes on their menu include mushrooms, okra, and leeks. It was a little disappointing but not a major issue. We didn't order this dish for the veggies.

So, how did everything taste? Good, but neither authentic Korean nor Japanese. I like onions (and we ate most of them) but I've never seen onions used so much in Korean or Japanese cuisine, especially in these dishes. Neither dish had the flavour profile that we expected. Maybe a sprinkle of sesame seeds or a few drops of sesame seed oil might have changed that. This is also the first Korean restaurant I've been to that didn't include any side dishes (kimchi, pickled radishes, bean sprouts, etc.). I missed that. There is, however, an item on the menu called Kimchi Trio (assorted Korean sides - $8).

Overall, the food tasted good, just not authentic. The service was good but it seems like everybody finished at the same time and it took a while to get our bill. For the value, I'd probably go somewhere else."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I was entertaining a friend from Vancouver and we were looking for something different (for him) to try. Looking through Yelp, a five star BBQ place grabbed our attention. Hello!

Beach Hill Smokehouse is located in the Upper Beach area, not somewhere known for a lot of restaurants, muchless good food. Walking in, there were a few picnic tables for dining and what looks like a bar still under construction. Walking towardss the back of the restaurant, through a narrow passageway, revealed more picnic tables, an open kitchen and the counter where orders are placed and picked up.

There was a short line ahead of us, giving us time to look over the menu. Their meats are priced and sold by the half pound. They offer a few sandwiches, basic sides, and some desserts. The fellow ahead of us got a juicy looking beef rib so we had to have one too. It looked so good! We also ordered half a pound of pork ribs, half a chicken, a small potato salad, and a large coleslaw. Yes we were pigs. I don't know how much the beef rib weighed but the total bill was $66 with tax and tip.

Everything was served on a tray, no plates, and only plastic utensils and lots of paper towels available. Rustic. Nothing wrong with that.

The beef rib was the most distinctive thing on the tray, looking like a lump of black coal with a bone going through it. BBQ lovers know that as the bark (think tree bark) and all the goodness is just below it. No disappointment here. The meat was so tender and juicy with a nice smokey flavour. A plastic fork or fingers were just fine to pull it apart. Excellent!

The pork ribs had just the right amount of resistance to come off the bone. Delicious! We should have ordered more.

The chicken, although good, paled in comparison to the beef and pork. If you like chicken, order it. I'll stick with the beef and pork ribs.

Their house BBQ sauce, neither sweet nor tangy, worked well with all the meats.

That beef rib must have been bigger than we thought. I ended up taking home some of the beef and a quarter chicken. That's what you get when you order with your eyes. It was just as good a couple of days later.

We learned a few things while waiting in line and ordering. This place has been open since January, 2018 and they're serving Central Texas style BBQ where it's mostly about the smoke. It's run by two Americans, one from Buffalo and the other from Texas, so I guess that makes it authentic.
 
It's been a few days since my friend returned to Vancouver and he's been texting me every day about this food. Yes, it was that good. Try it."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I came across a deal that I couldn't resist so my sidekick, Raj, and I went out looking for Kamasutra. It's an Indian restaurant on Bayview, south of Eglinton, with a Green P lot conveniently located across the street.

Once inside, we were greeted by a very cheery young lady, Danielle. The decor was very nice and upscale. We asked about the special that I had come across but the manager said it was only available Monday through Thursday, even though it wasn't dated. Anyway, we managed to get past that and the manager ended up taking care of us through most of our visit.

We ordered from a four course menu that had lots of choices. We started with the Onion Bhaji and Tandoori Lamb Tikka. Both dishes were delicious, packed with flavour. The onion bhaji was crispy and was served with a tamarind sauce and pickled onions. The lamb was served off the skewer with a mint sauce, some veggies, and more of those yummy pickled onions. Wow, a great way to start our meal!

The remaining dishes arrived all at once, each in its own bowl, making it very easy to share. It all looked delicious but the camera had to eat first. See photos.

The Lamb Vindaloo is a curry stew with potatoes and spices. It was very good but Raj thought it tasted a little gamey. I loved it.

The Kamasutra Butter Chicken had a lot of rich tomato sauce, maybe a tad more tomato than I'm used to in butter chicken but it did taste very good. The chicken was moist and had a good depth of flavour. This may be one of the top three butter chicken dishes I've enjoyed.

Palak Paneer (spinach and cheese) may not be a very attractive dish but this version tasted very good. Again, maybe another top three.

We tried the Malai Kofta, a dish I've never seen before. It's a cottage cheese ball in a creamy cashew nut sauce. Interesting, in a very good way. I would order this again.

Rounding out our meal was a Chicken Biryani, Pulao Rice, regular naan, and garlic naan. The pulao rice had a little saffron, peas, and cumin. The naan was hot and crispy and the garlic naan was delicious. I love garlic. The chicken biryani was colourful and had a generous amount of moist chicken. This might be the best one I've had.

We also tried Cheetah Indian beer. It's a lager that we both found was a little sweeter than the Kingfisher we tried recently. It was good.

Overall, I have to say this is the best Indian restaurant I've been to. The food was excellent. The service turned out to be be really good, especially from Danielle, who checked in with us frequently.

Now that I've discovered Kamasutra, I can't wait to come again. ;)"
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"Whenever I find myself hungry in an unfamiliar neighbourhood, I turn to Yelp for suggestions. When in Little Portugal, Portuguese food seems like the obvious choice. With 4.5 stars, Moliceiro certainly caught my attention and it was literally only 140m around the corner. We walked past a few interesting looking and very busy places on our way there. There was only one other diner but we decided to give it a try anyway.

To start, we ordered Cod Fish Cakes (Bacalhau) and Chorizo sausages. The fish cakes were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. A splash of lemon and a little aioli dip - delicious!

The sausages were flambéed at the table, unexpected but very nice. There were two types of sausages, one made with blood and the other with pork. I'm not fond of blood sausages but my companion was happy to devour it. I loved the other one. There was a nice tomato sauce with it.

I don't usually eat a lot of bread but we were served a freshly made locally sourced loaf that was so good, we had to ask for another one! We were so engaged in eating this delicious food, we forgot to order our entrées!

My companion, a lifelong friend visiting from Vancouver, chose the grilled squid and I chose the braised short rib. Although a few more diners had arrived, the kitchen still wasn't very busy and it didn't take long for our food to arrive.

Wow! Very nice presentation on the entrées and very generous portions. Lots of colour on the plates. Everything looked so good!

I tried the squid and it was very tasty and tender. The beef was cooked to perfection, tender, flavourful, and came off the bone very easily. Both dishes were delicious!

It's worth mentioning that the veggies were also perfectly cooked and the selection was very nice - broccoli, carrots, asparagus, potatoes, and green beans.

With everything being so good so far, we decided to share an order of custard for dessert. It was creamy smooth, not too sweet. Perfect! I've used that word a lot in this review and it's well deserved.

The service was also outstanding! Our server explained each dish and offered some suggestions. The owner came over and chatted with us a few times. Nice personal touch.

If you're in the mood for good authentic Portuguese food, not the grilled chicken that's served at fast food joints or chain restaurants, find your way to Moliceiro. You won't be disappointed.

PS - My companion was so impressed by this food, he made his way across town via public transit to have lunch there today. I have no doubt he'll go back again before returning home. He better invite me to join him!

PPS - Yelp almost got it right. It's 5 stars, not 4.5!"
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I was fortunate enough to be invited out to dinner with a friend visiting from out of town. Her aunt had a coupon for a set meal from Szhechuan Legend in Scarborough. I remember eating dim sum here a few years ago and I wasn't too impressed. Tonight, I'm a guest.

The meal deal included three courses of Peking duck, seafood soup, sauteed vegetables, and sweet and sour fish.

The seafood soup, and sauteed vegetables arrived rather quickly and was followed by the sweet and sour fish shortly after. The soup was hearty and thick, the way I like it. There was fish, crab, sea cucumber, shrimps, and vegetables in it. Very good. The sauteed baby bok-choy with garlic was cooked just right and also tasted good. The brightly coloured sweet and sour fish was very tender and flaky, cooked perfectly, and tasty.

The first course of the Peking Duck arrived with lots of thinly sliced duck meat in a large bowl. Pancakes (for wrapping), green onions, cucumbers, and hoisin sauce were served on a separate plate. Wow, that looked like a lot of meat! It must have been a big duck. Unfortunately, it was a little on the dry side and the skin wasn't crispy like it's supposed to be. Crispy skin is a very important part of this dish!

If you're unfamiliar with Peking Duck, the pancakes are used as a wrap for a couple of slices of the duck meat, a few slivers of cucumber and green onions, and a dab of hoisin sauce. See photo. It tasted okay, despite the dry duck. The pancakes were perfect and didn't stick together. Peking duck is usually served in two or three courses.

The second course was a soup made from the bones of the duck. It's a thin broth with some veggies and tofu. It tasted okay but a second soup? Not sure if this menu makes total sense.

The third (and last) course of the duck used more of the duck meat, stir-fried with peppers and onions and served with lettuce for wrapping. The green onions, cucumbers, and hoisin sauce from the first course go well with this. Again, this tasted okay but nothing special. After having three courses of the Peking Duck, I think I could have done without the soup course.

The service was fairly quick and efficient as far as serving and clearing goes. Our two servers, however, didn't speak or understand much English. I had asked for an additional plate for my photos and they had no idea what I was saying. Thank goodness our host spoke Cantonese.

Overall, the first soup and the fish were really good. The veggies were a little above average. The duck, the main feature of our set menu, was a disappointment. Although it tasted okay, I've had much better elsewhere, even at buffet restaurants. If I come back here, I wouldn't order this duck."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I've seen this place mentioned a few times on Instagram and Facebook so I've wanted to try it for a while. Unfortunately, it may be a long while before I return.

At first impression, the decor and lighting looked kinda nice. They have lots of big screen TVs that didn't necessarily fit in. The paper placemats didn't seem to match the decor. I though so anyway. The music was a bit loud so I indicated a table for two with my outstretched hand. A server motioned us towards a nearby booth and dropped some menus on the table.

Hmmm, my friend and I thought there were some odd items on the menu. There was Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Italian, and who knows what else. Dishes included Spaghetti Bolognese, Russian Bortsh Soup, Baked Chicken in Portuguese Style, Korean Beef in Stone Pot, Stewed Lamb Shank with Red Wine Sauce, Angus 3A Sirloin Steak, Cantonese Style Fried Noodle, Proscuitto and Leek with Spaghetti, Malaysian Larksa with Chicken Noodle in Soup, and lots more. I've been to food courts and food shows with less choices!

We had some questions about the menu so I waved a server over. She approached eagerly with a smile but I couldn't understand what she said. Maybe the music was too loud? No, that wasn't it. I have no idea what language she was speaking but it wasn't English. No English at all and no help from her colleagues. Since we couldn't ask her about the dishes that interested us, we ordered the Baked Chicken Portuguese Style and the Grilled Thick-cut Pork Chop by pointing to them on the menu.

Apparently, my meal came with a bowl of soup and a salad. I'm not sure if you could actually call it a salad because I finished it in two bites. Literally. The soup was a cream of potato with corn. It was just okay. Not very hot.

My friend's chicken dish arrived and it wasn't what we expected. Every Portuguese chicken dish I've seen has been grilled, piri-piri style. This was a coconut curry chicken served over a bed of rice after it had been baked (slightly burnt) in an oven. She said it tasted good.

My pork chop arrived, covered in a brown gravy that I wasn't expecting. It was served with a generous helping of white rice and steamed vegetables. It was a little on the dry side, despite the gravy and I could have done without the gravy. The pork chop could have been seasoned a little more.

Overall, it was a very confusing experience. We were puzzled by the menu, left guessing by our server, mesmerized by the TV that had a two second delay from the one next to it, playing the same program, and then there was the loud Billboard 100 Pop music. Oh, I almost forgot the screaming kid in the booth next to us.

On the bright side, dinner for two was a measley $23.90."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I was invited to join a friend at a newly opened rice noodle restaurant and it turned out to be a new experience for me. I had seen some pictures but I wasn't sure what to expect.

There's a special dish called ""Crossing the Bridge"" noodles, being served at this location only, for a limited time. My friend explained the history of the dish and its origins from Yunnan Province in China. The simplest way to explain this is a deconstructed noodle soup. Sounds simple? The presentation at this location is what makes it so special and spectacular.

Starting with a rectangular wooden platform, there is a bridge, more like a semi-circular spiral staircase, running from one end to the other and rising up to twelve levels. Each step contains a different component of the dish, including crab, shrimp, lobster, oyster, veggies, and more. In the middle of this circular bridge, rests a pot of hot broth (choice of flavour), and a bowl of rice noodles under the bridge. The idea is to place the ingredients in the broth to cook before eating. It's your choice of how or when to put them in. You can put them all in together (recommended) or individually. Got it? Take a look at the pictures.

Some may just call it a fancy hot pot and they may not be completely wrong but the presentation makes it very special. Although shareable, this is intended to be a single serving, like an individual hot pot. Being allergic to the shellfish components of this dish, I only tasted the spicy broth and it was very nice.

I had something off their regular menu, same concept but without the presentation. I had a bowl of the Original broth and it came with a tray of ten little dishes, each with a different ingredient, a small container of rolled meat in the middle, and a bowl of noodles. My friend suggested I throw everything into the broth at once and mix it up before eating. Since this was still new to me, I complied - everybody in the pool! From this point forward, it was a noodle soup, a good tasting noodle soup. I enjoyed it.

If you're wondering what the difference is between this style and just ordering a bowl of noodle soup, I would say it's just the style and tradition of the region it's from. It's part of the foodie experience. That's my take on it anyway. Am I wrong? Would I serve guests in my home this way? Probably not but I wouldn't discourage anybody from coming here for the experience or the food either.

In addition to the above, we also had deep fried squid tentacles and spicy cold cut chicken. The squid was nice and crispy with good flavour. My friend didn't enjoy the chicken as much as I did but I liked it and the sauce worked well with the noodles from my soup. BTW, there's no extra charge if you want more noodles."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"My friend, my little brother from another mother, Jay (Epicurean305), is in town and it's always a culinary adventure when he's around. The Cactus Club wasn't on his radar for this trip but I've heard it mentioned several times and was intrigued to see that Chef Rob Feenie was behind it. He did, after all, beat Iron Chef Morimoto, the first Canadian chef to win Iron Chef America. We just had to try it!

We were joined by a couple of fellow explorers and we were not disappointed! The flaming displays, the intimate lighting, the hip music, the decor, all made a good first impression. Nice place!

We started with cocktails, all very delicious concoctions. The Perfect Storm, their signature cocktail, stood out with its bold ginger beer and Kraken Spiced Rum flavours. Wow, what a punch in the face but it was so good, I had to turn the other cheek and take another one. My dining companions abandoned their choices and tried it too! ;)

For appetizers, we had the Tuna Stack and the Spicy Chicken. The tuna was a tartare, stacked on avocado, and served with wonton chips. It kinda tasted like sushi, in a very good way. High quality sushi. The spicy chicken was prepared with a sweet chili glaze and served with crispy wonton bits, creating a nice texture. Both dishes were delicious.

It was hard to choose from all the wonderful descriptions on the menu but I had my eye on the Duck Confit from the very beginning. Jay, always looking to try something different, ordered the BBQ Duck Clubhouse sandwich - Peking duck, roasted chicken, and prosciutto. Definitely an interesting combination. Our companions opted for safer (boring) choices in a Short Rib Pappardelle and Cheddar Bacon Burger. Really? You guys come to the guy who beat Iron Chef Morimoto and you order pasta and a burger??? Okay, so the burger that we saw served at a nearby table did look good.

Wow! The presentation of the food that we received was impressive, even the appetizers and cocktails. The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth tender and the portion was generous enough to take home half of it. The burger was huge, juicy, and delicious! So were the truffle fries. Okay, so they made good choices. Jay's duck sandwich was also very delicious.

The Duck Confit was OMG delicious and deserves its own paragraph! It was served on a bed of lentils, and topped with a baby frisee salad. I tried the lentils first and they were so tasty and then I discovered the bacon in there. Wow! I never knew lentils could taste this good. Maybe it's true, bacon makes everything taste better. The duck was so tender but had some crispy bits for a nice contrast in texture. Every mouthful of this dish revealed a burst of flavour. I loved it!

I would definitely recommend Cactus Club. Nice ambiance, good menu, great tasting food, excellent service, highly recommended!"
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"Most Caribbean restaurants in Toronto, and other cities I've been to, cater mostly to a takeout crowd. Having a proper sit-down Jamaican restaurant is a big deal, at least to Jamaicans. Or maybe just me. Chubby's has done a geat job in putting this place together, elevating Jamaican food to a whole new level and audience.

From the outside, it's a plain white house with a simple neon sign over the front door. Stepping inside revealed the WOW factor. The decor is so tastefully upscale in a manner that reminds me of a plantation style resort in Jamaica - the rich rustic woods, furniture, murals, lighting fixtures, and more. It's a beautiful space!

The menu is a reflection of Chef Donavon's Jamaican heritage and includes staples such as Curry Chicken, Curry Goat, Oxtail, Jerk Chicken, Jerk Pork, Rice & Peas, and more. There are also ""Likkle Bites"" and modernized versions of classic Jamaican dishes - Saltfish Fritters (mango-lime-papaya salsa), Double Dip (ackee and lentil dips, micro vegetables, jerk spice dusted chips), Ackee and Saltfish Bites (sweet peppers, onions, tomatoes, fried dumplings), and other creations.

My friend and I started off with the Spicy Jerk Chips (plantain, taro, jerk spice dust) and Slow-Baked Jerk Wings (wild honey, scotch bonnet dust, lime zest festival). The plantain and taro chips were sliced paper thin and were ultra crispy and tasty with the jerk spices. The wings were perfectly spiced and cooked and the serving was enough for up to four people as an appetizer. The delicious little festivals are not to be forgotten. Yummy!

For our main course, we ordered Curry Goat and Oxtail. The meats and rice arrived in separate bowls, perfect for sharing. Both dishes were cooked really well and were rich in flavour. The meats were tender and the gravies had the right consistency to stick to the rice.

To finish, we shared a Rum & Raisin Bread Pudding with warm caramel sauce and vanilla bean gelato. Perfection! I won't be sharing this next time.

I almost forgot about the house-made hot sauces that were brought to the table with our meal. If I recall, one had papaya and the other, passion fruit. My memory may be wrong but they were both very good.

My dining companion for the evening, a Jamaican chef who has cooked for US Presidents and Royalty, was as impressed as I was with the overall experience. As mentioned earlier, to me, this place has the feel of a resort, so does the food, a very good resort! They've done a lot of things right and I wish them lots of success. I'll definitely be back!

Disclosure: Donavon Campbell, Chef de Cuisine at Chubby's, and I worked together at a golf/banquet facility years ago where he was the Executive Chef. If this review seems biased, it's not because of my relationship with him, it's because I'm a Jamaican who loves good Jamaican food!"
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"My new foodie friends, Bethany C. (@feastandwander) and Marco F. (@eatfatkideat) were looking for a place to meet up and then I remembered. I heard about this place from Chef Andrea Nicholson (Butchie's, Food Network Canada) and if she recommended it, it must be good, right? Well, it wasn't good, it was great!

12welve Bistro | Tapwerks is located in the newly relocated Brock St. Brewing Company in Whitby. It definitely is not just another pub. Their food menu is diverse, with International influences, including East Asian, South Asian, European, Canadian, and more. The fancier (European) term, bistro, is well deserved.

Their drink menu has many choices of wines, cocktails, and spirits. Oddly, there was no beer. Huh? We're in a brewery, aren't we. Of course they have beer, perhaps too many to list? Our server directed us to an adjoining room where they have several taps with the current offerings. The beers (canned) and Brock St. swag are available for purchase here.

The place is quite spacious and the décor is obviously new, kinda industrial chic, with exposed bricks and ductwork. Large windows look out into the brewery, showing where the magic is made. Large windows on the  street side allow a lot of natural light in.

The second floor will be home to banquet facilities and there are plans for the third floor as well. There is elevator and stair access to those floors.

Okay, eat, drink, and be merry. Where do we start? It all looks good. Marco and I opted for a tasting flight of four beers. It was only $7.27 (odd number). Bethany chose a Moscow Mule, her favourite cocktail. We were all happy with our choices.

It took a lot of restraint to order just three starters to share. Everything looked so appetizing but we settled on the Butter Chicken Nachos (pico, cheese, lettuce, spicy cilantro, jalapeno, tamarind chutney), Korean Cauliflower Pakora (blonde lagered ale battered cauliflower, cilantro, spicy mayo, vegetarian), and House Smoked Wings (raspberry BBQ sauce). Read that again. Butter Chicken. Nachos. Korean Pakora. Blonde Ale. Smoked Wings. Raspberry BBQ. That's crazy, but it works! It works damn well!

The nachos had just the right amount of everything on it. I love butter chicken and I love nachos but I've never had them together until now. Well done!

Who the heck thought of mixing Korean and Indian together with beer in a vegetarian dish? Genius, whoever it was! This was our favourite dish and the one that caught our attention immediately on the menu. It was deliciously rich without overpowering the cauliflower. Another diner asked us what it was when he walked past us (it was pretty). He thanked us for the recommendation on his way out. Order it!

In comparison, smoked wings sounds kinda boring but it was far from that. The most obvious thing was the smoke. It was done just right. I didn't get too much raspberry flavour but I didn't care. These wings were darn good!

Overall, we were very happy with our experience here. It exceeded our expectations for ambiance, food, drinks, and service. The best part was sharing this with new friends, Bethany and Marco. We'll be back, maybe with more friends..."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I've enjoyed the food from the Ajax location of Beryl's Pepper Pot for the past few years so I was looking forward to the opening of their Pickering location, closer to home.

I arrived just after noon, an hour after they opened their doors to the public for the first time. The lineup was out the door! I guess I wasn't the only one looking forward to this. I quickly discovered that the line was for the takeout counter and they have a separate area with seating for 28 if you choose to dine in. I chose that option because I didn't feel like waiting. It took about 10 minutes to be seated, although one table was clearly available and I made eye contact with the servers several times.

I was soon joined by a friend and we were presented with menus. He's a frequent flyer at the Ajax location so he was familiar with their menu and daily specials. Wait a second, this menu is different. Our server confirmed that the dine-in menu and the takeout menu are different but I didn't get a chance to compare them.

I decided on the Jerk Pork Poutine ($10.00) and a bowl of Chicken Pumpkin Soup ($7.00 for Daily Soup). My friend asked if Stew Peas ($15.00) was available. It wasn't on the menu but it's a Thursday feature at the Ajax store. It was available for takeout so they were able to accommodate his request.

While waiting for our food, a diner next to us received his Curry Chicken Roti ($11.00). It was piping hot and huge! I doubt it would fit in a standard takeout box. It looked good and he said it tasted really good but he wasn't able to finish it. I told you it was huge!

Another table ordered the Grilled Lobster ($29.00) with mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables. It also looked very good and they looked like they enjoyed it.

Our turn. My soup arrived first and our server had to return with a spoon. It was hearty and delicious, with generous portions of ground provisions (yams, sweet potato, etc.), dumplings, and chicken. I would definitely order this again!

The poutine and stew peas arrived when I was almost finished my soup. Good timing. The presentation on both dishes was very attractive. They tasted even better than they looked. The poutine had a good ratio of jerk pork to sweet potato fries and a good amount of gravy, without drowning the dish. The stew peas looked really good, smelled good, and my friend said it tasted really good. The darn guy didn't even offer me a taste. Last time I invite him anywhere! Chef Beryl was not shy with the Scotch Bonnet pepper so beware if you can't handle the heat. Top marks for all the food!

Our visit, however, wasn't without some glitches. I have over ten years of experience in the hospitality industry, part of that time, training servers so I'll share my observations but I'm giving them a pass on the glitches today, having faith that they will improve with experience.
1. The menus weren't cleared from the table during the entire meal.
2. The plates arrived at the table on a tray because they were too hot to handle. And not just at our table. The servers had to use napkins and oven mitts to serve the food. That could be a hazard for diners also.
3. The empty soup bowl was not cleared from the table for the duration of our meal.
4. No refills were offered for our water.

Other than that, the decor in the dining room is rather plain, just white walls. It could probably use some texture or colour. Just my preference. I didn't notice any background music but the noise level was above average with the sound echoing off the plain walls.

Regardless of my observations above, I know this is going to be my go-to place for great tasting authentic Jamaican food. Congratulations to the team at Beryl's Pepper Pot on your grand opening! I wish you well."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"The Manor, operated by Peter and Paul's, is the banquet facility at Carrying Place Golf & Country Club, near King City, Ontario. I've attended two weddings here in the past, over twenty years ago, but I don't recall Peter & Paul's involved in those events. Maybe different ownership back then?

This time around, however, it's hard to miss their involvement. Their logo is plastered on every door, at eye level, and almost every employee uniform. You can't miss it. It's actually partially blocking your view of what's on the other side of the door. Now, there's nothing wrong with branding but this looked overdone. Every glass door, and there are many, had their logo on it. Events should be about the event, not the venue. That's just my opinion.

On this occasion, I was attending the wedding of some friends' son and his lovely bride. I also had the privilege of attending the rehearsal a few days prior. I was hoping to get a better idea of the big day's proceedings so I could effectively take better pictures. Unfortunately, the rehearsal date changed at the last minute and things didn't go as well as I had hoped. The actual ceremony site was being used by another event and they didn't have another site prepared for us. It was a bit awkward but we got through it.

On the big day, the weather was perfect and the venue was lovely. The ceremony took place on the lower terrace, with the guests under a large canopy, and the bridal party in the sunlight on the edge of a large pond. Beautiful!

Immediately after the ceremony, we were ushered back upstairs to the reception area and banquet room because there was another wedding ceremony scheduled right after in the same space, with their reception taking place in the lower banquet room.

The reception area, in front of the bar, was a bit cramped for the number of guests but we all made it work. The passed hors d'oeuvres looked tasty but I didn't get a chance to try any of it because I was busy trying to take pictures, a request from the groom's parents, some dear friends of mine.

The dinner, the main purpose of this review, was okay but could have been better. The first course, Lobster Bisque, was poured at the table, French style. I'm allergic to lobster so I had what tasted like a Roasted Red Pepper soup. It was very tasty but a tad on the salty side. My dining companions said their soup was also a bit salty.

The second course, a salad, was very attractively presented. It was dressed with what tasted like a sesame dressing and accompanied by a deep fried crab claw. I suspect the crab claws were provided by the hosts, not the venue. This course was perhaps my favourite of the evening.

The main course featured Steak, Chicken Breast, Potatoes, and Veggies. First impressions? It was salty! Very salty! My table mates said the same thing and some couldn't finish their meal because of this. The steak was tender but tasted like it had been sitting for a while. The veggies were the best part of this dish!

Dessert was a trio, featuring a Tart, Chocolate Mousse, and Creme Brulee. They were all a bit on the sweet side but I managed to finish the creme brulee and most of the mousse.

There was also a late night station, featuring do-it-yourself regular and sweet potato fries, pulled pork, melted and grated cheese, gravy, and a variety of toppings. I tried a little of everything. Despite the pork being a little salty and the fries being soggy, this wasn't bad.

Overall, the wedding was lovely! The venue was beautiful, the banquet servers and bartenders were very good, friendly and efficient. The event staff were constantly communicating with the wedding coordinator, a friend who sat next to me. I even noticed a distinguished gentleman, wearing a tux, sweeping the floor. A supervisor, perhaps? Kudos for doing whatever was necessary!

If the communication for the rehearsal, and the food at the wedding was better, my rating would have been higher. That's too bad because everything else was good, very good!

Disclosure: I worked on the banquet side at one of the top wedding venues and golf courses in the GTA for over ten years, ending in 2016. I may have noticed things that the average person wouldn't have, hence the lengthy review."
Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,"I came here for a Yelp event last year and although it wasn't a full dinner experience, I was impressed enough to want to come back. When a group of friends wanted to get together for dinner, Draco was one of the places that I recommended so I booked a table of 11 on a Saturday evening at 6pm.

The weather was not nice but everybody made the effort to show up, from as far away as Whitby and Mississauga. They were all impressed with the decor and ambiance.

For groups of ten or more, Draco requires a $100 credit card commitment to secure the reservation and we were limited to a reduced menu of three appetizers, three mains, and three desserts of our choice. That was not a problem because we all ended up ordering mostly the same two mains and desserts anyway. They also automatically add 18% gratuity for larger groups. That's the nitty gritty, nothing too unusual.

A few of us ordered cocktails and wine. I had the Prohibition Flight, consisting of Buffalo Trace, Blanton's, Eagle Rare. At $17, it was more than reasonable. They were unable to make Mojitos because they were out of mint but the Blueberry Moscow Mule was a worthy substitute, while others had wine.

Our three choices of appetizers, Shareables as Draco calls them, were Draco's Crab Cakes, Hot Maple Bourbon Wings, and King Cole Duck Confit Poutine. The crab cakes (two) were a little on the small side while the other dishes were definitely large enough to share (with up to four people as an appetizer or as a single meal). The wings were served with fries, veggie sticks, and garlic aioli. They were a little spicy for some but had good flavour. Good but nothing unique or outstanding. The duck confit was very good, with a decent amount of duck. Crispier fries would have made it better.

The most popular entree for the evening was the Holden County Beef Ribeye steak, followed by the Maple Mustard King Cole Duck Breast. Although we had selected the Wild Boar Chop as our third choice, nobody ordered it. My steak was cooked properly medium-rare, as I had requested. It was tender and juicy and matched well with the cauliflower puree, grilled king oyster mushrooms, and demi glaze. The duck must have been as good as it looked, or better, because nobody offered a taste. Geez, I thought we were friends. These were two very good dishes!

For dessert, we had selected Cheesecake Spring Rolls, Muskoka Lodge Brulee, and Beavertail Bites. Nobody ordered the cheesecake. The brulee was perhaps the prettiest presentation of the evening, served in two cups, most likely for sharing. Comments told me it was good but no sharing (with me). I had the beavertails and it was nothing like I remembered from the Yelp event. It was very dense, not at all like how I remember it. I had to use a knife to cut it. I recall it being more like a donut. I mentioned it to our server and she offered to bring me something else but I was already kinda stuffed. I wasn't charged for it.

Throughout the evening, the service we received was excellent! The staff were very attentive, courteous, and professional. We ended up spending a considerable amount of time chatting and catching up with each other, even after we had paid our bills (they were split without any fuss). We never felt rushed to leave, even when we were the only ones left in the place. We felt a little guilty but other guests arrived for drinks so a friend and I ordered another round.

She had another glass of wine and I ordered their signature cocktail, Draco's Smoked Old Fashioned. This was now the presentation of the night, worthy of several photos. The drink was mixed at the bar, transferred to an attractive bottle, where smoke was introduced and then capped. I was presented with a glass at our table, with a single spherical ice cube, larger than a golf ball, and then the server poured the drink over the ice. You could definitely smell, and then taste, the smoke. Excellent cocktail! I had several of these at the Yelp event but not with this presentation. This alone is worth five stars!

It was a totally enjoyable evening of good food, great service, and very dear friends, but there's more.

Howie Mandel, renowned Canadian funnyman, TV host, and judge on America's Got Talent, was with a group at the table next to us. We respected his privacy but he knew that we recognized him so he came over to our table when he was leaving and chatted with us for a few minutes. He told us he was there with family (he's from Willowdale) and he was heading to Denver for a show the next day. Nice guy. We should have asked him to pose with us for a group photo. No touching."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"I'm torn between a 2-3 star for this place. I was expecting deliciousness. What I got was sometimes decent, sometimes mediocre. I probably would not come back as it leaves little to be desired. 
We got the angus beef AYCE (not the wagyu) and while angus beef is supposed to be higher quality meat, we didn't find it better than some of the other AYCE places we go to. The meat is also really really THIN which causes it to burn quickly so you have to be super quick, I wish the meat was thicker so you can enjoy it more. It's not hot pot here! They also seem to put all their meats and some of their veggies suck as okra and mushrooms in marinade. Everything is really sweet and you don't get to eat the natural flavour. I can't enjoy the beef flavour because it's covered in some sweet soy sauce. The pork belly too was super thin and honestly, I didn't know you can mess up pork belly but I was not enjoying it. I've been spoiled by the thick cut pork belly at authentic Korean restaurants, and this one does not melt in your mouth at all. In fact this one was thin, dry,  and tasted like paper. 
The good things I liked about the restaurant was the cooked food. The takoyaki was really good, so was the butter corn, the clams, the chicken karage, and the edamame were all tasty. 
The restaurant is very modern and new and bright with lots of tables so there was no wait. The service was average but we didn't expect much really. It was $35 pp on Sat night with a mandatory 12% gratuity charge. Overall, I would say I had an okay meal but mostly because I enjoyed the cooked foods and not the meat. The meats DID NOT live up to my expectations at all."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"Hmmm interesting restaurant. Not what I was expecting but it was recommended by someone so we decided to check it out. It's not quite Italian as the staff are Chinese.. and it's not quite a pasta bar as their menu is quite diverse. 

Let's start with the ambiance. The candlelight makes it romantic and cozy but the decor on the walls, the flashing lights outside the door and everything else make it not quite romantic just dark and cozy. We walked into an empty restaurant at 8pm which really isn't assuring. 

The menu is diverse. They have the standard pastas, some fresh pastas which sound interesting eg the zebra pasta, the jalapeno pasta, etc, and they have the meats and fishes. 

The most important thing about a restaurant is the taste of the food. Next is the price. The first is ""meh"". The second is good. So depending on what kind of diner you are, this restaurant could be a hidden gem for you. I tried the exotic mushroom soup which to be honest I can't figure out what was exotic about it. It tastes like Campbell's soup with another kind of mushroom tossed in. I also got the lasagne which tasted unconventional, no red sauce, quite meaty but the cheese on top was burnt and chunks of burnt cheese is no fun to eat. It was a $16 meal. Nothing to break the bank over but I'm not sure the value is there. In this competitive market, there's too many options that are within that price range. The portions were big enough though I'll give them that. 

My partner had the conch soup, shrimp cocktail and the duck pasta. He seemed to enjoy his meal So there you have it. I'm always on the lookout for hidden gems but this one didn't work out for me."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"My 200th review goes to Yuzu No Hana. I had a lovely dinner there so worth a special review. Had the Omakase here, multi course tasting menu. Each course presented with an explanation and one special course presented by the chef himself. 

Started off with an oyster shooter topped with garnishes and paired with a raw quail egg. The combination of flavour was very good. 

Then came an assortment of small bites. I can't really remember their lengthy descriptions.  All I remember was everything was tasty and there was a really good seared tuna, a uni tempura, a fluffy fish morsal, and a nicely sliced sardine twirl. 

Then came a teapot filled with mushroom and seafood soup. It was really cute to be sipping soup in a tiny tea cup and then eating the contents from the pot afterwards. The presentation is impressive. 

Next came the sashimi plate. Good selection and the fish was very fresh. I especially liked the ginger that came with it. 

Then came an intricate package where I untied it and found a sweet soy glazed cod fish. The fish was very tender and flavourful. 

And then came the assorted sushi platter with different colors of tuna, salmon and octopus. 

In case I wasn't stuffed yet (I was) out came the soba noodles in soup to fill you up. I'm not a fan of soba noodles per say but I ate it all anyways. The mushroom broth was very smooth. 

And finally we had dessert - sake cheesecake with raspberry sauce. The cheesecake was very light and mousse like and the sake flavour was light. A nice way to conclude the meal. 

The atmosphere was also pleasant, cozy and warm. We went on a weekend and dinner took us 3 hours but service was great and meal was worth it."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"This restaurant would be much better if it didnt try to be everything. They have a MASSIVE menu. Drinks (bubble teas, hot teas, coffee), Appetizers, Taiwanese snacks, Asian desserts, Ramen, Stone Pot Rice, Main dishes with rice... the problem is when you try to do too much, you can't do anything well. 

I find the menu here is a hit and miss. Some items are good, like the fried fish cakes (deep fried, piping hot, good order size, sitting on a bed of pickled radish and so delicious), and some items are not so good like the bimbimbap (missing egg, seaweed, bean sprouts, kimchi... when asked the waitress why the dish did not have half the items shown in the picture, she said the menu is old and they haven't changed it yet. So for $9, my friend got a really big bowl of rice and some carrots, some beef.. and I'm not sure what else there was.....). 

My order came out pretty decent. I got the satay beef with rice. The plate of beef was huge, and the dish was overflowing with onions. good value for $10. The flavour wasn't immersed in the meat though, and some pieces tasted pretty bland. I also got the soy tofu with ginger for dessert. It was very gingery and hot which made it perfect for winter. The syrup was served on the side so you can choose how sweet you want it to taste. 

Overall, I think this place is good for desserts or snacks and to chat in (the setting and environment is perfect to catch up with friends) but this is NOT the place to eat a good meal. My friend ranted about her meal for the next few hours.. and she also told our other friends, her parents and maybe even some strangers on the road. Like I said, the food is hit or miss. You've been warned."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"The Doctor's house is a pretty little gem that is worth the visit. I've been here twice so far. Both times the ambiance has been amazing, the food delicious, and the service relatively slow. 

This restaurant is perfect for a romantic dinner for two. Or make that a family night out for five. My second time here I scored a coupon so we took advantage of it and ordered four appetizers, four mains, and four desserts. So worth it. 

Appetizers: 
The spinach salad is really good, the pepper crusted tuna on a bed of salad was nice though slightly over peppered, the marinated octopus was super tender and the taste was interesting but you have to like slimy seafood to dig this one, and the minestrone soup was standard fare. 

Mains:
The crispy cornish hen is absolutely delicious. Get it! The striploin is well flavoured and leaner than the tenderloin, while the tenderloin is obviously more tender. Get them medium rare. I found the medium to be slightly overdone for my liking but my mom loved it. The veal loin was a good size and very tender as well. all paired with a cucumber salad and potatoes. Good portion size, no tiny portions here! 

Desserts:
We tried the creme brulee, warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, NY cheesecake, and also the tiramisu. i would say all of the desserts were well made and delicious. Tiramisu was the fave among the group and it was not overly sweet. Creme brulee had a nice crunch on top and inside it was thick and creamy. 

Service is on the slower side but staff was wonderful. The site is very pretty overall, lots of weddings taken place here and for good reason. They even have an outdoor fireplace for after dinner drinks out on the patio."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"This place cares enough to make a fuss about my hair. I don't even give my hair that much attention. This is how you know you've found a keeper. And this never happens to me. 

Waited about 20 minutes before I got a hair wash. I did change my appointment time last minute so I didn't mind. There were tons of magazines to look at and lots of hairstyles to pour over to find the best cut so the wait was really nothing. The salon itself is pretty no frills. Mint green walls, portraits with faded frames hanging off them, somewhat tiny space with about 3 wash stations and 6 stations for clients, but the service is wonderful and friendly. 

Finally I got led to the wash station. I got a 8-10 minute shampoo and head massage. Most places spent about 3-5 minutes washing your hair.  While the head massage by no means compares to the awesome service you get at salons in Taiwan, but this is by far the best massage  in North America that I've got. Though funny thing did happen, the salon ran out of hot water.  They only had cold water coming out of the sink. No problem. They boiled some water and added it to the cold water and poured it over my hair. Um, creative problem solving but I hope this isn't the norm! 

Then I met my stylist who went on for 30 minutes cutting my hair, checking both sides for evenness every 2-3 minutes. He's meticulous and very attentive to details. I ended up getting a cut just like I chose from the magazine. So happy! All this hair attention for $35. I feel safe to say that I trust these people with my hair and will be back for more pampering very soon :)

PS, they also have wifi so I was able to catch up on emails and news while getting my hair cut. How awesome is that!"
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"3.5 Star 'm very hesitant to write a review after only one visit. Maybe because I had great expectations and my experience didn't quite live up to that. My party came in just before 12 on a weekday and only had a 5 minute wait. After 12 pm, it's about a 20-30 minute wait depending on your party size. No wait time for people eating alone. 

Our party of four ordered three of the clam based ramen with an egg each, and one bowl of tonkotsu ramen with an egg. First off, the clam ramen comes in intense flavour (aka soy flavoured) or light flavour (aka just clam). I found the broth to be good but the clam flavour isn't very noticeable. It's not like Chinese clam soup or anything like that. The noodles here are very good. I liked the egg as well. You do have to pay for it ($1.50 each) on top of the ramen price (~$14) so it's about $15.50 a bowl plus tax and and tips...  but you do get a whole soft boiled egg. The pork in the ramen is different from other places. There's no fat on these at all. It's a very lean, thin slice of pork. Bland and boring in my opinion.  Maybe I just like my fatty pork. They do offer this but you have to order separately. The tonkotsu ramen has the same kind of pork as the clam ramen but the broth is made from boiling bones and it is very milky colored and rich. This might be the best tonkotsu broth I have ever had (including in Tokyo). Seriously good. 

Service was good despite it being busy and everything tasted very fresh. Price is much higher than other places but the ramen here also tasted more refined. It's not the most satisfying bowl though hence 3 stars. I'm not quite a fan yet. Next time I'll try the tonkotsu ramen with the fatty pork and see how that goes."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"I truly adore this place. Only wish I lived closer. 

The atmosphere is amazing. It's bustling on a weekday lunch. Smiling faces, engaged conversations, servers walking up and down the aisles, a small line of people waiting at the front for their tables, expensive looking espresso maker at front..... 

The place is filled with large and small booths, dark wood panels, and dim lighting. I would describe the Senator as a classy diner. 

They have a big menu but I settled for the Senator breakfast which came with 2 eggs, challah toast, 5 slices of bacon, potatoes, beans, and coffee. All this for $8! An excellent breakfast deal.

Let me tell you a secret. This is the best diner coffee I have ever had. Seriously - you need to try this. 

My over medium eggs were perfect with just a bit of runny yolk and not overdone. Challah toast was slightly sweet and delicious!!! I could eat 10 slices if they gave it to me. 

Service was super friendly but super slow. I had the time but I saw some customers wait a long time for their order and couldn't even enjoy it when it did come because they needed to get back to work. Not the place to come for lunch if you have an hour lunch break. Because it literally took 45 minutes for the food to come after the order. I didn't mind though. This is the place to come to enjoy great food at great prices with great company. Or if you don't have company, you can easily strike conversations with people around you. Some of their booths are awfully close to one another. My booth was literally side by side with a couple of guys and I could hear their entire conversation. 

I was super happy after lunch. My only regret is, why did it take me so long to discover this place? Once again, thanks Yelpers!"
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"So I haven't gone to a Demetres in a decade or so. But I always remembered their massive menu, crazy endless dessert options, and dark lighting and chill vibes. Well not anymore!! They totally revamped and it ain't nothing like it used to be. 
The dark lighting and chill vibes has been replaced with pink, white, and teal walls with mirrored walls and gold lighting. It's very Instagramable inside and has a pretty Parisian cafe look. The huge endless menu is now a one pager and while I like that they are more focused and I don't need half an hour to decide, I miss some of the flavours and cake options they used to have.anyways, after a short browse, we ordered the apple crumble with cheesecake, the milk hot chocolate, and the 50 shade London fog. Order took awhile to come due to place being super busy on a Sunday night. Lots of dates happening, social gatherings, etc. 
When the order did come, I realized long gone is the Demetres that I love. I can tell instantly by the skinny clear glass my hot chocolate came in. What happened to my cozy thick mug? I feel like that's what makes hot chocolate cozy and delicious. Instead, the skinny glass cup looks pretentious, contains 5 sips and ultimately was not rich or flavourful. Disappointing. Hot chocolate was very milky not enough chocolate taste. The London fog was very aromatic and fragrant but also very milky and served in a skinny glass. They also don't have specialty milk like soy options. The Apple crumble with cheesecake was good but lots of bite to the apple and not baked enough. The Cheesecake was soft and warm but very tasty and came in a  large portion. 
Overall verdict: pretty place, good for hangouts and dates, good desserts, disappointing drinks, and definitely a Demetres that's not the one you remembered"
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"I was really looking forward to try this place but when I did, I really wasn't too impressed. Inside it looked nice and modern. They spent some time making the place inviting and tasteful which is nice. The place is huge but when I came in for weekday lunch, I was the only person in the restaurant.. Hmmm... I wonder why. 

Lunch specials were just under $10 and you can choose either tempura, sushi, or sashimi. The Bento boxes has a lot to variety so if you like to sample many items, this would be a good choice. They have 2 shrimp and 7 vegetable tempura, and your choice of teriyaki or sashimi or sushi. It comes to be $16-21. 

First off, taste the tea. Tea cup is really pretty, tea comes piping hot. And then I smell detergent on the cup and I no longer want to drink tea no more.  

Miso soup came next. It was nice and hot. Perfect for a cold day. There was 2 pc of seaweed in it and no tofu. Hmm I  usually get tofu...

Then came the 9 pc tempura - came out fresh and hot. Wonderful. Tempura sauce was lighter than what I like. 

Then came the fried spring roll side dish. For whatever reason, they serve a fried spring roll cold. It was pretty bland. 

While eating, pop music was playing in the background. Some of the songs had inappropriate lyrics. I don't think they are catering to high school students nearby because the price point for lunch is too high.. The students are all next door at Pizza Pizza. And the music definitely doesn't suit nearby workers on lunch break. 

Overall, didn't really enjoy my dining experience. If I was craving Japanese and they are the only restaurant around, then I'd be back. But since there are several other options around, I think I'll be checking out other places. 

Side note: service was fast and friendly. I was in and out of the restaurant within 25 minutes."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"Helloooo Smokey Goodness! 

I came to Big Bone BBQ last night with a group of friends. I'm still full from last night's dinner. I probably ate more than enough. Their portion sizes are huge. 

We got the NASHVILLE NACHOS, BBQ CHICKEN SANDWHICH, CHICKEN CLUB SANDWHICH, and PARTY PACK #2. There were 6 of us and we paid about $17 after tax and tips and a drink so really reasonable. 

The nachos appetizer was HUMONGOUS. It was $12 and came with sour cream, salsa, jalapeno peppers, cheese, and lots and lots of pulled pork. The pork was slightly sweet and delicious. 

I didn't try to the sandwiches but my friends enjoyed it. I only came for the meat! :P

The party pack #2 came with 1 Full Rack, 1 lb Wings, Beans, Coleslaw, Cornbread, Large Fries & Tub of Sauce. It says it would feed 2-3 people but it actually fed 4 of us. We are girls, but we can eat! The ribs is fall of the bone good and smoked in such a lovely way, I just want to savour the smell. We skipped the fried wings and opted for smoked since that's what they're famous for and it was mighty good! 1 lb = 9 pieces

The cornbread tasted okay. The texture is more pound cake than traditional corn bread and the beans were a bit too sweet. Coleslaw was fresh, crunchy and delicious. And the fries platter that came with the meal was HUGE! They taste like Costco fries which we love. 

Few things to note:

- Place closes early - at 9 pm every night. 

- You can get dipping sauces on the side so if you want, you can get your wings naked and then get some of the sauces on the side so you can dunk them in and try a bunch of different flavors at no charge! SWEET!

- The service is super friendly! And the vibe is great. 

- The place itself is kind of small. You really only want to come in groups of up to 4. We had 6 so we waited a bit until we got two tables combined. Most people come in to get take out."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"Recently started working in Newmarket and I was tired of going to Tim Hortons and Metro to grab lunch everyday so I hopped on Yelp to see what was nearby. Honestly, I never travel north of Major Mackenzie prior to this so I was delighted to see quite a few restaurants with high ratings in the neighbourhood. 

Craving some sushi so I decided to check this place out. Came in to grab take out. Decided on the salmon teriyaki combo which comes with soup, salad, 3 sushi and 3 california rolls. I also added in a side order of yam tempura roll. I couldn't resist based on the reviews from Yelp!

Order took about 15 minutes to arrive. Slow for takeout. Yes listen to the other reviewers - order ahead! Atmosphere is nice in the restaurant, a good number of seating, tables on both side of the walls with curtains for privacy, or you can sit by the sushi masters and watch them do their art. Servers and chefs are friendly and engaged in conversation with their regulars in seemingly perfect English. There are also lots of magazines to read if you're alone. 

First off, tried the yam tempura roll. They were huge! 6 big pieces, very good. Although I found them to be even tastier when they are cooled. Yam tempura taste is light but I still like it. They also gave me extra yam tempura shoestring fries on the side. 

The three sushi were tasty and fresh. Rice had great flavour and cooked perfectly. 

The Cali rolls that came with the combo was huge. Lots of ingredients, thin layer of rice with sesame crusted on the outside. Love the avocado. 

Miso soup was good, green salad was a bit salty but I liked that they had julienned beets in it. The rice was perfect. Salmon was a bit overcooked but the sauce was delicious and made up for it :) 

Even though I got takeout, it was still presented in a lovely way in three nice take out containers. All this for $20. Pretty good!"
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"Some friends and I came here on a Friday evening for drinks and food. We really enjoyed it. I thought the food and drinks we ordered were all very good and overall vibe in the restaurant was great. The wait to get a table was a bit long ~ 30 minutes as we didn't have a reservation, however they had 3 bars where you can wait for your table and grab a drink so it really isn't much of a wait. 
We waited at the second floor bar area and got some drinks. I tried the Perfect Storm and it was delicious. Just the right amount of spicy kick and I do love ginger beer. Bar area is a big oval circle and people were sitting all around it. The place was bustling with people but it wasn't crowded or uncomfortable which I find is really  hard to pull off. 
Soon after we were seated at our table and we ordered some plates to share such as the fried calamari, the tuna stack, and the chicken wings. All 3 plates were a hit and soooo gooood! Especially loved the tuna stack. The flavours were irresistible. The calamari was some of the best I've ever had. For main, I got the steak and fries. Steak was fine, it was a leaner cut but it wasn't outstanding. Definably bit disappointing compared to the appetizers that I loved. The fries however is another story. This restaurant serves my favorite fries in the world. Seriously I never ate so much fries in my life. I ate mine, then my friends, then my husbands... and then I packed the leftovers home and the next day, I microwaved it and continued eating it and it was still SO GOOD. Just writing about it makes me want to eat it again. I have no idea how they make it but if I ever get a hold of that recipe, I'd probably become really really big. hahaha Anyways, I gotta go back to this place soon because I didn't get to try the dessert menu, and I want to try like the entire cocktail menu, as well as check out their rooftop patio. Prices were average for this type of establishment. Apps, 1 Main and 1 Drink was about $50 per person."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"What a great experience. I came here for a RMT massage but was advised I could come hour and a half earlier to ""enjoy the waters"" so I decided to check out what it was. I loved my experience in the waters. At first I thought the pricing was outrageous but then I went and it is totally worth it (still pricey though at $44 on Tuesdays or $54 every other day). However, it is complimentary if you book a service so mine was included in my service. Their prices for RMT massages are about $40-50 higher than other places though so they may as well be included in the price. If you book a service, take advantage of the waters. It is so relaxing and nice. In fact I think I enjoyed it more than the actual massage. 

The spa is very new and modern. The waters area includes: warm Dead Sea salt pool, hot Epsom salt pool, cold plunge pool (very cold, dip in and then get out!), aromatherapy steam room, infrared sauna (love this! It got hot fast!). They have a chart and a circuit for you to follow. There is also nice showers with great smelling soap and shampoo, lounge chairs, bathrobe, towel service and your own flipflop. It is also bathing suit optional. Reminds me of the hot spring experience in Taiwan. 

After the water experience, I felt very relaxed. Then I went to get a therapeutic massage. My therapist is quite gentle and gave me a relaxing massage. I didn't feel like she worked out the kinks in my neck and back per se but it was so comfortable that I fell asleep. (or maybe I was super tired that day)

The only thing stopping me from giving this place a 5 is because it's really expensive and I feel it is slightly over priced. My RMT also did not provide me with any information about what she did to treat my back or ask me to come back for more treatment. She seems to be more able to provide a relaxing SPA experience as oppose to treat my problems. Other than that, place is super clean, street parking super convenient and ample, and service is friendly and excellent."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"Oh boy. 

My water park adventure landed on a day when their slides weren't operating. Apparently the day before one of the water pipes broke and they were trying to fix it. So all but 2 out of the 16 slides were operating. That alone would not warrant them a one star. I'm rational. Things happen. I was annoyed they did not update their website to let people know though. I literally checked the site 30 minutes before I drove out to Brampton around 11 am (not right when it opened) and nope, no news at all. Was only told the news when I got there and ready to park. Now that I'm at the door, OBVIOUSLY I'm not going to turn back and head home. It took me 45 minutes to get there! Anyways, all this annoyance would only dock them one star. 

Two stars are docked for cleanliness. The lazy river was full of leaves, random stuff floating around. I don't even want to know what all those ""stuff"" are.  They do have people in the river using nets to catch all the stuff floating around, but obviously that's not solving the problem. And they have signs that says everyone in the waters MUST wear proper swim wear for hygienic reasons. Well I think that sign is just for show. I see people wearing jeans or pants and just in the water walking around, or pushing people in the tubes. It almost seems normal and the staff does not bat an eyelash. 

Another star is docked for upkeep. A lot of places need to be repainted. 

So I paid for admissions, parking, locker, food, and a tube. And I got to spend my day in the lazy river and the wave pool multiple times. Not very good value at all. It almost feels like the management at this park just could care less. If you are looking for a water adventure, I'd head to the water park at Wonderland instead. A bit pricier, but a great value for everything that comes with the admission price.

On a side note, I will say that the food prices were more than reasonable for an amusement park, and the kiddy area had a good variety of fun things to do."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"So glad I discovered this place! Thank you Yelp yet once again! 

I've been craving shawarma after having it during a recent trip to Montreal. That place was amazing so I hopped online to try to find some in Toronto but most of the places are out of my way. So when I found this place on Yelp, I was curious. 

Honestly, I never noticed this place before. I drive on Woodbine all the time but I never notice this plaza. Their red and yellow sign kind of reminds me of Chinese take out. I don't know why. But anyways eventually found it and went in and found the restaurant empty. That's usually a bad sign but I REALLY wanted shawarma and this is the closest place to me in Markham. That, and the food behind the counter looked REALLY REALLY fresh. 

Their menu consists of shawarmas, shish kebobs, falafel, soup, salad, potatoes, desserts.....  I didn't have a hard time choosing though because I came in here with a sole mission! 

So for $6.50 you can choose from beef, chicken or mix of the two. I decided to get the mix one and thought that the price is a bit higher than the ones you can get on Lawrence... but as the man behind the counter started loading my ""everything"" onto the pita, I soon realize, this is by far superior. 

""Everything"" comes with garlic mash, hummus, coleslaw, red cabbage, tomato salad, pickled turnip, pickles, and hot pepper. Then you get the white sauce and the hot sauce. I'm sorry but I don't know the names of these toppings so I can best only explain it this way. But the combination is AMAZING. 

As you can tell, my pita was loaded. The pita itself is SOLID. No thin, soggy, limpy stuff here. It was thick and tossed on the grill to be warmed up before the meat and toppings go in. The meat itself was average, the beef a bit dry, the chicken was better more moist but the pieces were cut too small in my opinion even though there was alot. 

I was so very much satisfied and their shawarma is so worth the $6.50 and then some. Definitely a keeper in Markham!"
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"I loved my experience at the Miraj Hammam Spa. I was in need of some TLC and found a Travelzoo deal online. I heard great things about their products so I decided to give this place a try. The deal comes ith a 45 minute Claudalie facial and a 45 minute pedicure. 

We started by checking in and was guided to the handsomely decorated change room with private pincode lockers, showers, bathrooms, and a little lounge area with lemon water to sip. Each locker has a clean robe to change into and spa flip flops. I got changed and was led to a private room for the facial. They use Claudalie products which are all natural and the active ingredients are all from crushed grapes. They smell amazing and the face massage felt so good. *Note, day after, my skin is feeling a bit greasy. I'm normally dry so this definitely moisturized my skin and left it plump and juiced up but with the weather in Toronto getting very warm, it's giving me a greasy feel. I highly recommend adding the eye add-on. So worth it but it's pricey at $45. 

After the relaxing facial, I was led to the lounge area where they have dark cabanas and where you lie down to read magazines, and feed on grapes, a baklava and mint tea. There was also dried cranberries, water, and banana chips available. It is soooo relaxing. The spa is quiet on a weekday afternoon. I could lounge there all afternoon. After about 15 minutes, someone came to led me to another area for my pedicure. The pedicure area was clean and bright. The overall pedicure experience is average. The color selection is average, about 15-20 color options and the outcome was nice but no wow factor. For the price tag, it's not really worth it

I didn't try the waters since with the deal,  you are paying just $145 for the base package and you have to spend $150 or more to use the waters. So I can't really comment on that. 

Tax and tips are mandatory at check out and is based on the original package price. Overall, this is a splurge experience for special occassions even with a package deal. But it did not disappoint."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"3.5 star. Overall a nice and intimate restaurant with romantic vibes. 

Came here for New Years Eve dinner. For seatings after 8 pm, it was $125 not including drinks, tax or tips so kind of pricey. It's in Yorkville though so that's almost expected. We decided to go to this restaurant because of the live pianist and singing. When we first arrived, there was a pianist playing and it definitely set the mood but he only played about 15 minutes? Then the music stopped... and didn't come back on until 10 minutes before we left the restaurant so it wasn't continuous entertainment. We left an hour before midnight. We booked a late dinner hoping to do the countdown there but it wasn't the right atmosphere. We decided to go elsewhere for countdown. 

Here's the NYE menu and our ratings. 

Starter:
Prosciutto, Soppressata, Beef Salami, Pickles, Olives, Crostini - delicious!

Bella Vittano, Blue Fume, Brie De Meaux, Spiced Nuts, Chutney, Crostini - also delicious! Loved the sour cherry chutney. 

Antipasti:
Truffled Beef Carpaccio, Parmagiano, Crispy Capers, Crostini - this was a very large plate and the beef was well seasoned. 

Red Wine Braised Octopus, Black Kale Pesto, Wild Fungi, Cherry Tomato - this dish was okay. The texture of the octopus wasn't great. It had a canned tuna like texture which was weird

Mains:
AAA Angus Beef Tenderloin, Roasted Truffled Gratin, Honey Cippolini, Heirloom Carrots, Madeira Jus - this was delicious! We ordered the beef medium rare and it was cooked to perfection and oh so tender. 

Seared Chilean Sea Bass, Tuscan Style Black Kale, Miso Glaze, Butternut Squash Puree - the fish was cooked perfectly and the butternut squash puree was done really well and highlighted the dish

Dessert:
Chocolate Torte, Mango Panna Cotta, Fresh Berries with Mint - the torte was slightly too sweet but the mango panna cotta was perfect. 

Overall:
I don't think the price is quite worth it. With drinks it was more like $150 pp before tax and tips. Also no consistent entertainment and service was just okay. Some servers were more friendly than others. Food is pretty good though. Would be a good date spot."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"First off, I wanted to try this place because the restaurant interior looked very pretty and the menu selection looked great. Perfect for girls night out. 

We booked for Friday evening and when I arrived, I was greeted by a lovely host who took my jacket before I headed to the bar area to wait for my friends. They have a good selection of wine, a small selection available by the glass and a short list of cocktails available. The bartender recommended the Wanderlust to me so I gave it a try. A little too floral for my liking but very different. It would be boring if I just had a mojito or sangria here anyways. 

After my friends arrived, we were seated to our table. The dining room is surprisingly spacious and very pretty. The ambiance is nice and slightly dimmed. Part romantic, part stylish and chic. We ordered a bunch of items off the menu because we were famished and also we had trouble deciding. 

They started us off with basket of different breads served with pomello butter. The butter is like mixing regular butter and marmalade together except you get it i one go. Delicious.

Moved onto appetizers. We had fried frog legs and tuna tartar, both of which were nicely executed. The frog legs were just the right amount of crispy and tasted like fried chicken except it was kind of bland. 

Then we moved onto the mains. My friends got the seafood pot and the braised short rib with bone marrow which they both enjoyed. The size of the mains were well portioned (there's no tiny plates of expensive food here). I got the flank steak and I was very very impressed by how amazingly delicious it is. The higher option is the striploin but I always get striploin so wanted to try something new. I was expecting the flank steak to be tougher and dryer since it is the lower end option but I was so wrong. The flank was so tender, delicious and juicy! I ordered medium rare and it was just perfect. 

I had to leave early so didn't get to try the dessert menu but heard great things about it. My sister did end up buying a box of macarons in the bakery there and they were gigantic! Very elegantly placed in a nice box for her. Overall, great place to go for date night or with your besties."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"I don't know why I didn't discover this place sooner. Definitely a keeper! Totally a gem :) 

From reading the reviews, I knew this was more family style steak house - perfect for me because my family loves steak! Really nice ambiance, very clean, super duper friendly service. 

Got free beer of the day samples for everyone in our dinner party. Woot woot! We also ended up ordering a Beer Sampler - 4 samples for $7 - a steal! Steam Whistle tastes good with steak!

Then out came the complementary warm and oh-so-soft bread served with whipped butter. I asked for seconds. In fact, I'd pay good money to eat this bread. 

Our party got the:
- NY Striploin with half lobster, served with mashed p and peppercorn cream sauce
- Fillet Mignon with half lobster, served with frites and mushroom cabernet sauce
- Salmon filet with mashed p
- Chicken Marsala x 2
- Side house salad

Okay now onto the review of the food.. I leaned over and helped myself to everyone's food so I can write this review. Only for you guys fellow yelpers. I am usually one who keeps to myself :P

Striploin cooked medium is FABULOUS. A very very memorable steak. I'm strictly eating this cut from now on. The mashed p was creamy garlicky and delicious. I heart the peppercorn cream sauce. Better than the mushroom wine sauce. The fillet mignon was so tender and cooked really nicely but I like a bit more of a bite to my steak. This one just melted in my mouth. Lobster was a good size and served with warm butter. Lobster was cooked perfectly, not over cooked, was sweet and totally worth it. The chicken marsala and the salmon were both tender and juicy as well. The side salad was enough to serve 3 people. Kinda surprising because now I wonder how many the regular dinner salad can serve.... It was a bit waterly though but everyone else seemed to love it.

I wasn't a big fan of their dessert. The berry cheesecake was very mousse like and not the texture of cheesecake I like. They surprised our birthday girl with a free chocolate brownie that was super sweet and gigantic. Even with 6 mouths, we didn't finish it. The prailine and cream ice cream served on top of the brownie was a hit. Loved it!

Did I mention the service was amazing?"
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"3.5 STARS

This auto detailing centre has been open for a few months. We discovered this place through a deal on Groupon. Since it was so new, we could not find any reviews for this place so I decided to write one up for those weary of businesses without any reviews and for those curious about this place. Interestingly enough, Extreme Clean Today also cleans homes but this review is for their auto detailing division. 

We got the $69 deluxe package which usually retails for $289 and includes everything they offer. Took about 3 hours. Finished on time as they said it would be. 

Let me break down my review:

Customer Service - 4 stars - friendly, personable, and explains the processes to you if you ask them. 

Value - 4 stars - for $69, it was such a deal. If I had got my car detailed at the dealership where I got my car, it would have easily ran over $1000 including labour costs. Groupons are awesome. 

Satisfaction - 2.5 stars - I have high standards for a lot of things and I wasn't quite impressed with the state of cleanliness of my car. Sure it was way cleaner than when I brought it in, but there were spots in my car where there was solidified dirt, and there was an area with gum that they tried to take off but couldn't. (They said they tried but didn't want to ruin the carpet by scrubbing it more....) I know for a fact that if I had taken it into my dealership for a cleaning it would have met my 5 star standards but like I said, it is pricey and this was an amazing value. They did a good vacuum job and general cleaning job. 

Convenience - 3 stars - I live in Markham so this was a trek out to Etobicoke which isn't really convenient for me. But having said that, this location is right by hwy 427 so easily accessible if you have a car, and while waiting, there is a huge IKEA within 10 minutes walk so you can head over there to kill the 2-4 hours time while waiting. 

And while this auto detailing centre isn't the most convenient location for me, I'm glad I discovered this place and will consider coming back here the next time I rack up a mountain of dust bunnies in my car. Why? Just because, great customer service is important to me. And this guy delivers. I hope his business does well :)"
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"I'm a new fan. Went twice in two weeks. First time I came I had a junior stylist and just wanted to curl my hair. I was greeted by a stylist with wonderful curls so I knew I was in good hands. I was ushered to the washing stations and got pampered with delicious smelling shampoo and conditioner followed by a really nice head massage. Probably the best head massage I've experienced in Toronto. Most places take 1 minute to wash your hair but this place probably takes 5. I felt really relaxed afterwards. Then I was ushered to the cutting station where not one but two stylists were drying my hair (they have a lot of staff on hand and even though there's about 10 or so cutting stations and most, if not all were filled, they still had stylists / staff in idle mode) After that, I got a nice blow out followed by curls and then about a bottle of hairspray put into my hair. Haha let's just say my hair was in place the whole night. Total for blowout including tax and tip is $38. 

The next time I went was the following week. This time I got a haircut with another junior stylist. Told her what I wanted, and she confirmed it by looking through a magazine then pointing to a picture with what I had in mind. Then I sat in the hair and even though it was the first time meeting her, I already trusted her with my hair. I know this because I totally fell asleep. Like the entire time. I may have woke up once while she was blowing it out after the cut. After she was done, I thought it looked okay.. it wasn't exactly what I had in mind but it wasn't bad. But the next day when I washed it, and days after, I started really liking the cut. It has lots of layers and movement and effortless to maintain. Totally love it. 

Overall I really like this salon. Great value, nice head massages, cheap cuts at $35, chic and trendy salon, friendly staff who understands Asian hair, Japanese and Chinese stylists, uptown location... like seriously, what's not to like?

Other random stuff: They serve you delicious herbal tea in a cute cup with silicon lids, have a locker for you to store your valueables, and have lots of magazines for you to browse in case you need inspiration

P.S.. cash only. Cards accepted if more than $60 in services."

Their menu and the delicious looking drinks in the posters on the wall makes it really hard to actually choose a drink. Some interesting items that caught my eye: honeydew smoothie with coffee jelly topping, apple vinegar drink (I never tried it but it's really popular in Taiwan for losing weight), avocado smoothie, milk tea with glass noodles, smoothies made from real fruit, soda (??), etc...

Ended up trying the Hokkaido Milk Tea with Pudding, which is their signature drink and packed four other drinks to go. I also tried the stewed beef rice. I don't know what secret recipe they used but the curry beef was MMmmm Mmmm Good :)

The Hokkaido Milk Tea (HMT) was creamy, strong, and the pudding was a lot of fun. The drinks are all fully customizable by ice level, sugar level and mine was just right. I saved some for my sister who is a HMT lover and she approves big time! :)

So my family was super happy when they saw me come home with drinks. I told them I needed to sample them first so I can write a review about this new place to which they happily agreed. Here's my verdict on the other drinks:

Matcha Snow Cap (matcha smoothie with a salted cream on top) The cream is non dairy so okay for people who are lactose intolerant. I thought this drink was interesting and delicious. A bit of sweet and a hint of salty. 

Grapefruit Juice with Aiyu Jelly. This drink is light and super refreshing. Just the right hit of tart. 

Taro Milk Tea with real stewed pieces of taro inside

Brown Sugar Milk Tea with Tapioca. I've tried this many times in Taiwan and so I wanted to see if their version stacked up. I hate to be disappointed, but this place did not disappoint. Brought me fond memories of bubble tea in Taiwan. 

Did I mention this place smells like freshly cooked and sweetened tapioca pearls? I went in at 1 pm today and that's exactly how the entire store smelled like. Sugary goodness.  If you don't know how that smells like, you need to get yourself here!"
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"I recently joined this club after seeing it a few times through passing. It's near my workplace so I thought ""why not?"" I find that joining a gym close to work always helps you to actually go to the gym since you don't have to go out of your way to get there after a long work day. 

So first of all, I want to say, the pricing for the membership is great. For $4.99 biweekly you can get a standard membership at one gym but you have to agree to a full year commitment. That is still about 1/3 of what you would normally pay at other gyms. For $9.99 biweekly and a one time $44 initiation fee, you can get access to any Fit4Less location and there is no commitment. I opted for the latter. You sign up online either at home or at the gym and you need to bring your void cheque to punch in your bank information for direct deductions from your bank. 

The gym itself is quite spacious and a good size with multiple machines of everything. Did I mention the machines are also brand new and in great condition? The gym does get busier during peak times such as noon and right after work but even then, it's still not as busy as Goodlife. The rush usually dies down by 6:30 pm. 

There is no water station so you have to bring your own or purchase from the front desk. There are two individual shower rooms and one individual accessible shower room. There are two washrooms, one for female, one for males. The female washroom is pretty clean. There are also two individual change rooms which is always locked. This is my beef with this place. I can never get a room to change in and there is not much space in the washroom to change and put your stuff either. My other beef with this place is the size of the lockers. It is so tiny that I usually have to split my bags and put them into two or sometimes three lockers! Craziness! 

The atmosphere of this gym is pretty good. Everyone is there to work out. There's no group classes though and there doesn't seem to be much chatter between people. Usually everyone keeps to themselves and there is music playing in the background and several tvs by the treadmills

I've been here for about two weeks now and it's alright. For the price, it's worth it. However, I don't think it's for me. I miss the group classes at Goodlife and the big change rooms!"
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"I feel like I must write a review to defend this restaurant. I was hesitant to come here due to all the negative reviews, but because my friend invited me and she said the food is really good, I thought I should at least hear her out. 

This is my conclusion: stay clear of the sashimi, and dig into the grilled foods! 

Perhaps their bad rep on Yelp is hurting their business. When we went on a week night during dinner time, there were only 2 other tables. The rest of the restaurant was empty. Maybe the location also had something to do with it. 

My friend's been here before so she starts writing down a bunch of orders. Hmm I'm not sure if she brought her own pad of paper but she started jotting down a lot of stuff. I sure hoped we could finish all that food. I'm not sure I'm hungry enough to have AYCE.....  but you know what? Once I started digging into the food, my appetite spontaneously came. Especially after the Diced Steak with Garlic. Garlic is a sure appetite opener! 

Here's how the food stacked up:

Grilled Eggplant - Pretty bland but my friend loved it

Chicken Fillet - tasty

Diced Steak with Garlic - super

Baked Mushrooms with Butter - MUST TRY***** Man this is so good! 

Black Dragon Roll (eel on top) - delicious

Yam and Avocado Roll with Brown Rice - something different and I loved it so much we ordered two

Grilled Saury Fish - I'm not huge on grilled fish but my friend loved it. 

Deep Fried Chicken and Skewered Curry Chicken - good

Tempura - average

Edamame - overcooked

Short Ribs with Black Pepper Sauce - delicious

Green Salad - watery

Salmon and White Tuna Sashimi - I love sashimi but theirs is ""meh"". I don't agree with the other reviews that it is super tiny. It's more like average sized. But it doesn't taste the freshest and it looks kind of sad. 

Salmon Sushi - So so. Seriously I like the sushi from T&T more. 

$19 for dinner (cash price)

I hope that provided you with a road map for how to do AYCE at Tanaka Sushi. If anything, the Baked Mushroom with Butter is addictive and sure to steal some hearts! If you like grilled foods, and if you like variety, you should check this place out. They had a lot of other hot foods that I didn't get to try such as the steamed egg. I think I'll have to come back to try the other half of the menu another time ^_^"
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"I loveeeed my recent stay here! Everything was very nice. A solid 4.5 stars! 

RESORT:
The resort is very beautiful during the day and night. I think the pictures speak for itself. I heard they turn it into a magical place during the winter holidays with millions of lights. But it gets really expensive during that time. We went in Sept and got a great deal. If you like a 5 star hotel with great amenities, in a place with sunshine everyday, hot, close to shopping and hiking, THIS IS IT. 

ROOM:
Our original room in the main building was fine. Except the shower was super small and I coud barely turn around. So we decided up upgrade to the sunset building. The sunset building is new (1 year old) and it's very nice! The showers are also HUGEEEE!! You can probably fit 10 people in there. it was only a $30 upgrade so very worth it in my opinion. 

POOLS:
The resort had 6 pools or so. I only got to check out 4 of the pools and my absolute fave was the adults only sanctuary. I loved the using the floating mats and also lounging in an oversized chair reading my book. It was nice because there were umbrellas so lots of shade when you want shade. I hate it when the hotel doesn't provide umbrellas. I mean, its only 35-40 degrees with blasting sunshine! Without it, I'd probably burn in 30 minutes. The neighbouring pool has two water slides and was a bit busier but because I went in mid Sept, it wasn't overly busy. The water slides were fun for both adults and kids alike. 

FOOD / SHOPPING
While at the resort, I got to try the Mexican restaurant on site. It was very good. The breakfast at the American restaurant was also very good. It wasn't as expensive as I thought it might be. Nearby the resort, there are lots of restaurant options within 5-10 minutes drive. I highly recommend the coconut shrimp and fish taco restaurant. It was superb! And a nice shopping mall just 5 minutes drive away. Seriously, the best location. Lots of options never hurts! 

HIKING
Great hiking is 5 mins drive away. The views were great. Lots and lots and lots of cactuses. 

SERVICE:
Top notch service. No complains at all. It wasn't above and beyond level but it's on par for a 5 star hotel

ViBE:
This is a good place for weddings or business gatherings. Not as much for solo travellers as everyone is in groups and there's not much mingling. The people at the resort are classy and dressy but I didn't get a snobby vibe. It was just right."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"My family has a thing for teppanyaki places so when this place opened we were eager to give it a try. We came here for the 8 pm teppanyaki sitting. There were 6 of us and we were seated at a table with a party of 2. The chef that manned our table was friendly and entertaining. Nothing overly showy but he did a few tricks flipping the food, made sure things were cooked to our liking, and got some of us to go up to the cooking side to take pictures with the chef hat. 

Our party ordered various individual sets including the  seafood set, the steak, chicken, and salmon set, and the lobster and filet mignon set. We also ordered a piece of 6 oz A5 Hida steak that we split amongst us and cooked half to medium and the other half medium well. 

First off, the soup and salad starters were good and pretty standard, then came the seafood and lobsters. Adding extra lobster tail was $28 and so worth it cause it was very tasty. The shrimps, salmon, scallops were all perfectly cooked and tender. They give everyone a dish with three different dipping sauces which were all tasty. I really liked the miso one. Then we had the steaks and chicken. Steak was cooked with garlic and butter which you can't really go wrong there. Chicken had a very good teriyaki sauce and I think it was my fave the entire meal. The Kobe beef was cooked last and it was very tender. Because it was so fatty and marbled, the medium well was better than the medium cubes. It would have tasted better if it was thinner slices in my opinion. Maybe I'm not a Kobe beef fan but it was too fatty for my liking. The A5 Hida was $188 and we were so full by the time it came that we really didn't need it. I'm glad I tried it but would not order it again.  The meal was then finished off with really delicious stir fry veggies and very bland sirloin fried rice which no one finished. Some sauce and white rice would have worked better I think. Lastly came ice cream! They only had two flavours green tea and vanilla which was fine. 

One thing that was impressive throughout was the service. The place was still busy for the 8 pm seating but service was very attentive. We had tea refills every 10 mins or so and it was easy adding to our order. 

Overall we had a really enjoyable meal and will definitely be back. After tax and tips for 6 people would have been around $300 but ours was $500 because of the A5 steak, the pricing is very reasonable for the quality and experience. They also have a veggie and tofu option for $18 which I think is great."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"I can't believe I haven't wrote a review for Pacific Mall yet. This place is like my backyard. I have been coming here since 1997 when it used to be half empty. Now it's always packed especially on the weekends. This is your ONE STOP SHOP for everything Asian. Like, everything. Really. 

As a long time Pacific Mall (aka pmall) insider, there are some dos and don'ts to note about this place. 

DO:
- get bubble tea! Or fresh fruit juice! Lots of independent and chain tea shops here. Most of them are decent. When in doubt, look for places with long lines. The crowd is usually right. OR, you can ask me :) I think I've tried every tea shop in this mall. 
- eat in the food court upstairs. Cheap and delicious Chinese / Asian food. Lots of choices ranging from noodles, fried rice, Japanese, Singaporean, Vietnamese, to dim sum, and Chinese bbq. If you need more choices, head next door to Market Village. You won't run out of options. 
- browse and compare cell phones, wireless providers and accessories. Every major wireless provider is here and you can easily compare and find the best plan for you. Ask for deals. They have lots of deals because Asians love a good deal! Lots of stores with cute cell phone accessories! Also the place to go if you want to unlock your phone. 
- get your car stuff and electronic stuff and computer stuff. As you can tell, I don't know much about these ""stuff"" but I know from my friends that this is the place to go to get these ""stuff"" for a good deal. 
- come here for your Asian fashion needs. Lots of clothing stores with various styles from Chinese traditional gowns, party dresses, to anime costumes, street fashion, and the latest trends in Asia. 
- and of course, do ASK if they have any specials available. For example, many places will waive tax if you pay cash, or give you a discount if you buy more than one or more than two. They may not always tell you so it's good to ask. 

DON'T:
- buy something without checking out a few stores. Usually more than one store carries the same item and  you'd think they offer it at the same price but sometimes there's a huge price difference. I once found a hair clip for $15 at one store and $40 at another store and they were totally identical. 
- expect you are getting the real deal if you're buying something branded. It doesn't matter if it's a designer bag, jewellery, sunglasses or even ginseng. I'm not saying everything's fake, but I'm saying beware. Even if the owner says they're the real deal, you be the judge. I've heard too many stories."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"The place to go when you have a group of people with different tastes. They can simply pick what they want to eat from the abundant choices and all is satisfied. Hooray! 

For those that never been here before, this is not a buffet. It's a Swiss style restaurant. Meaning you get a card, walk around and see which food items are calling your name, pick one up or place your order, get the item charged on your card, go back to your table to gobble up the feast, then at the end, when you're on your way out, you pay the tab on your card. Simple right? Just don't set your eyes on everything. Trust me, you won't have the stomach to fit it all in there. 

I actually went there last night with my family for a night out. I used to frequent this place a lot when I worked in the area. So I can say I've tried about 70-80% of the items in the restaurant. They do have some new additions / stations that weren't there when I frequented this place before but everything else is still there so that was good. Phew! I was worried they no longer make those delicious strawberry shortcakes....

1. Juice / smoothie bar (pineapple lemonade - interesting twist and delish!)
2. Coffee and Tea bar (Latte is weak. Espresso is not strong enough)
3. Wine station
4. Sushi station
5. Pasta (fresh and baked) station
6. Make your own pizza station
7. Bread station / Sandwhich station (premade)
8. Veggie station
9. Soup station (4 varieties -  never knew this but there's a price difference between their meat and meatless soups)
10. Savoury crepes station (it's fun to see them make it infront of you. You choose a meat, then they load it with cheese, and field greens. We got the smoked salmon one and it was a winner)
11. Sweet crepe and waffle station, along with the gelato / ice cream bar (only about 6 selections but they tasted really fresh
12. Grill station (the salmon fillet is DELICIOUS. Trust me on this one. It's so tender. I used to eat it everyday. The ribeye and the top sirloin are also really good but beware, ribeye is totally fatty and the oil on the plate might gross you out. This isn't exactly a steakhouse... but if you want meat, their meat is tender and good. The medium rare is more like a medium though)
13. Pho and vermicelli station
14. Fruit station
15. Dessert station (strawberry shortcake and bread pudding are amazing!!!) 

I think I covered all the stations. The quality is good and everything is freshly made for the most part. Dinner for five piglets came out to be $160 after taxes. So about $30 per person. Considering the selection and quality, it's a good value. 

PS. Their washrooms are really clean and glamorous! Bonus points."
KBh4r16e9Grc1HI9pG4wTg,"When I heard about a restaurant opening up in Casa Loma, my ears certainly perked up. And a steakhouse at that. So when my husband ended up taking me here for my birthday, it was was nice surprise.  
Upon arriving, the grounds immediately drew me in. It's just so beautiful. The restaurant uses the side entrance of the castle and they have setup a reception area which then leads to two dining rooms, one on the left and one on the right, both just at the opposite end of the conservatory. The left dining room has a gorgeous bar at the back that is truly an eye catcher. We got seated at the right dining room which was just as lovely. We took an early seating so it was not too busy when we arrived but by 6:30 it was full and bustling. The dining room has big windows that lets in lots of light during the day/late afternoon and after the sun went down, they dimmed the lights and created a romantic cozy vibe. The banquette seating was pretty low but the table was pretty high so it was a bit awkward at times while eating. You can't rest your arm on the table like you normally would as the table comes to mid chest and I'm not a short person. 
FOOD: I started with a cocktail that was fruity and had a little ice tray with raspberry and blackberry floating on top of my drink. It was unique and the drink was refreshing and fruity which I liked. We then ordered the table side caesar salad for two which is one of my favorite caesar salads to date. I could have used without the whole anchovy sitting in my salad though. It was slimy and off putting. But the bacon bits, the crouton, the freshly made dressing totally made up for it and I loved the salad. 
Next, we moved onto the mains. We wanted two different steaks to share so we opted for two different textures. The first was the Nebraska filet and the second was the American Wagyu Ribeye, both medium rare. I found the filet to be very lean but very tender. The medium rare was good for this cut. The ribeye was so juicy but I could have done with a medium for that, just cause I like the fat to be totally melted but it was more medium towards the ends of the steak so really, not a big deal. Very flavourful, totally recommend these two cuts depending on what you like though. We also ordered the scallops to share which my husband really liked. I thought the sauce was excellent but I'm not a scallop person to begin with so I wasn't crazy about the dish. The scallop was well seasoned and cooked though. It wasn't rubbery. I really enjoyed the sauce. It had corn in it and was interesting. I could have lived without the popcorn on top of the dish though. Who puts popcorn on a refined scallop dish? It didn't score any points for taste or presentation, and this is someone who absolutely is crazy about popcorn!! But it has to make sense and this dish did not. 
By this time, I was pretty full but my husband wanted dessert so we took a look at the menu. There was about 5 choices and we opted for the caramelized banana crepe for two. It was also made table side but we waited about 15 minutes or more which seemed really long. And this dish I could have lived without the table side assembly. The crepe was pre  made, the caramel sauce was made table side, with some bananas thrown in, crepe, and then topped with fresh squeezed orange. The taste was okay but I had better, and parts of our crepe was burned even though the sauce wasn't caramelized yet. So execution wise, it didn't go so well. I think if it was done in the kitchen by the kitchen staff instead of our server it might have been better. 
SERVICE: The service was attentive at the beginning but not as consistent once it got busy. There were also water and crumbs on our table after the main meal but no one wiped it like they normally do in a traditional steakhouse. It's still a solid positive experience though. 
PRICE: You can expect to pay about 300-500 after tip and tax for two people depending on what you order. The place is not cheap but the value is there for the cocktails, and the steak, both of which I thought were made exceptionally well. 
Overall, the food and drink was really enjoyable and the atmosphere is oh-so-romantic! You can also take some really lovely photos inside and outside the restaurant while you are there to capture the experience."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"Let me tell you about Cibo..

We went last night after seeing Kathy Griffin so we were both in dazzeling moods having laughed all night.. well leave to someone to suck the good out of your mood right quick.

We arrived at Cibo right at 10, they close at 11. The usual host and hostess sat next to the door chatting with some friends. The waiters were sitting at the large table in the front wrapping silverware and the bartender well he just ignored us completely. Finally one of the waiters asked if wanted a table.. no we would like to stand their and smell the pizza! Duh! So we asked him to hold one moment as we used the restroom real quick. Then when we came back he was gone and we were standing there once again being ignored. Finally the bartender made a huge sigh and asked of there were only 2 of us.. so he takes us to the left dining room and there are only 2 tables in there.. guess where he sat us.. right next to a couple that looked like they getting VERY romantic.. so they gave us crusty looks.. I then asked the bartender if we could just sit at the bar (I can appreciate someone wanting space, I didn't want to sit next to them either).. so he turns and looks to me, sighed again and said ""if you want"".. like those words were somehow causing his hair to fall out. So I said ""Oh wait, I wouldn't want to put you out!"".. he then just turned and stormed towards the bar.. the Mr stopped him and said never mind.. (he didn't want him waiting on us after that little episode) so we sat next to the couple.. they looked at us like we had just interrupted a marriage proposal and she hadn't quite answered yet.

So Im mad as all heck.. Ive been treated badly before but I gotta know you before you can walk all over me! Im SO over Cibo at this point and ready to leave but the Mr talked me into staying.. he has this special talent of calming the beast, not that I turn green and tear my clothes off or anything but my tongue has been known to be very sharp! 

Waiter arrives takes our drink order.. nice wine list though very small.. he returns with the drinks and takes our dinner order.. antipasti, a rustica and a tricolore.. I asked if I could have prosciutto put on top.. you know what he says.. ""Ill ask the chef if you can have that.. he doesn't like changing HIS pizza's"".. I cocked my head at him (I think the vein in my forehead was ready explode) ""he doesn't like to change his pizza's"".. if you offer toppings on the menu for an up-charge, wouldn't you think they would actually give them to you? Talk about the dang pizza nazi! The waiter returns a few moments later or the 'chefs messenger'  (I think he was sweating) tells me that the chef has agreed to let me have the proccutio but only on a plate. Oh thank you thank you oh lord oh messiah! 

Can you believe this place?

While the food was good the attitudes here has really put me off.. so the 2 stars are for food only.. the Mr and I will never come to this place again.. Cibo has officially been scratched from our minds. Oh, I will be sending this review to them as well.. that way if they even care, which I doubt, they will address not only the bartenders attitude (little scruffy guy) but the idea that the customer pays their light bill and tells all of their friends about the place!"
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"Who doesn't enjoy a lazy Sunday morning? I love spending time leisurely reading the Sunday news while getting caught up on a weeks worth of cooking shows. After a few hours hunger finally sets in and its time to find something cheap and easy. While that might sound more like a lifestyle choice than a way of eating, cheap and easy to me means dim sum, and lots of it. With a fistful of cash and my growing appetite I head over to my default dim sum house, Golden Buddha. 

Located in the Chinese Cultural Center, Golden Buddha has been pushing carts every weekend for the past few years. Over those years they've become a destination for steamy delights and have built quite a following with groups usually packing the lobby. Here's some advice, for a lesser selection with no waiting, go early. If you want more selection and don't mind the wait, go after noon. 

Ranging in price from $2.35-$6.50, Golden Buddha pretty much offers mainstream selections from dumplings and chicken feet to rice and noodles. Most of the cart pushers don't speak much English but know this; most items are either made with pork or shrimp. 

Within minutes of being sat the first smiling server rolls up her cart and begins pimping her wares. As she lifts the steel lid from the first steam basket, the mist dissipates to reveal 3 white fluffy hidden treasures beneath. Know as char siu bao, or steamed BBQ pork buns, these are pretty standard for any dim sum brunch. Pulling apart one of the doughy pillows reveals its sweet porky center, add some chile oil for added depth. Probably the most typical offering is the pork dumplings or sui mai, a wonton wrapper filled with ground pork and black mushrooms. These meaty bites have an enjoyable earthiness that left me wanting to ask for another basket.

The next cart to come along is absolutely filled with fried items. I love the crispy crunch of egg rolls and while the GB version was crisp, the inside was filled with oil that tasted like last nights fish. After only a single bite the rest remained untouched. Seemingly fried in the same oil, the salt and pepper shrimp were not only super fishy but the shells were also left on. Shell on shrimp isn't usually a problem when the shrimp in question is cooked really well. Not the case with these, they were ruined before they even hit the table, greasy and salty.

On a lighter note, wrapped in translucent rice paper, the spring rolls were large, filled with chewy rice noodles and 3 plump shrimp, unfortunately these were also flavorless. 

A new one for me was the Zhaliang, a long tubular Chinese doughnut that is tightly cocooned in a sheet of rice noodle. The end result is more about texture than bold flavor; I can see how so many people seek these out for breakfast being chewy and crispy at the same time. 

Dim sum brunch isn't complete without at least one Chinese dessert. Pointing at a plate of pineapple buns or bo lo yau from the dessert cart, these pastries actually contain no pineapple. Instead the name refers to its crunchy checkered top crust. Inside the bun you'll get a sweet surprise of satisfyingly sweet custard filling.

While I left satisfied, overall Golden Buddha doesn't quite have the chops they used to, but in a pinch or on a lazy Sunday morning, they'll do just fine."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"As we arrived at FnB we immediately felt right at home. There was a faint smell of toasted marshmallows in the air and the hustle and bustle of Chef Charlene Badman's small open kitchen felt like being at mom's. The warm glow of owner/manager Pavle Milic's face fortified the welcome feeling.

Short for Food and Beverage, FnB seems to have everything aligned for culinary greatness. With food and service worthy of a long-established restaurant, you'd be surprised that FnB has been open only a few months.

Located in Old Town Scottsdale, the space formerly housed the famed Sea Saw. The bar surrounds the small open kitchen, with views of Badman and Sous Chef Sacha Levine working their magic. Or, if romance is in the air, opt for a table for two. FnB is cozy and intimate.

Farm fresh, seasonal and comforting describe Badman's creative and fun menu. Even something as simple as Citrus Marinated Olives ($4) just tastes better with a touch of orange peel.

The menu is not large, with only a handful of nibbles, appetizers, sides and entrees. On one visit, our knowledgeable waiter didn't even bat an eye when we ordered just about everything on the menu.

Lightly dusted in semolina flour then flash fried, each crustacean of the Crispy Rock Shrimp and Jalapeno Tartar ($9) has a nice feathery crunch. Fried Green Tomatoes with Green Goddess Dressing and Feta ($11) combines classic components, yet brings something new and balanced to the table.

Braised Leeks, Mozzarella, Mustard Bread Crumbs and a Fried Egg ($13) are as simple as they sound, but tastier than you'd imagine. This is the beauty of Badman's cooking: farm-fresh produce prepared with love and attention.

Since it is based on seasonal bounties, the menu is always changing, so don't be surprised when your favorite dish is no longer available. During several visits I had the opportunity to try something new each time.

Try not to fall in love with the pasta offering -- on one visit the pasta was a Garganelli and other times it was Strozzapreti ($19). Both were perfect, cooked al dente and served with local veggies.

Blue Nose Bass, Snap Peas, Hazelnuts and Citrus Sauce ($21) was fresh and light, yet meaty and satisfying.

Roast Jidori Chicken ($20) sounds like a cooking preparation, so I was surprised that it's actually a breed of Japanese chicken. Smaller than your standard chicken, it's amazingly flavorful and juicy. As one of my dining mates put it, ""It tastes how chicken used to taste."" Each succulent bite reminded me of how simple ingredients in expert hands can be so fulfilling.

Grilled Broccoli, Meyer Lemon Aioli and Crispy Onion ($6) is one of the sides. The smokiness of the slight char on the broccoli is alluring and adds an exotic dimension to something that would otherwise be ordinary.

Badman's desserts are handled with as much love and care as the rest of our experience, which made them all the sweeter. Topped with whipped cream and finished with a grating of nutmeg, each joyous spoonful of the Butterscotch Pudding ($7) brought comfort and delight. 

Looking into the kitchen, I could see plumes of smoke in the air as a ramekin filled with Mint Chocolate Creme Brulee ($7) was getting seared with an iron.

It all made sense as burning sugar filled the air, like roasting marshmallows at a campfire. It's one of those things you long to come back to -- home."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"Over the river and through the woods.. lalalala, la, la.. Cave Creek, AZ is kind of a drive but I suppose no worse than driving to Gilbert from Scottsdale. Though this journey includes cactus, multi-million dollar mansions and the occasional coyote rather than tract homes and freeway. Once you get out there the entire area is sort of like old cowboy rustic charm. So doesn't it makes sense to open a BBQ joint way out in the middle of somewhere? The owners of Bryan's sure did!

Only being open just over a month, Bryan's was hopping busy and there is a reason why.. the smell. You can just about taste the pecan smoke as you pass by or pull up. Its an enticing fragrance that grips, strokes and pulls you in to see what's about that hopefully delicious smokey goodness. 

Once inside you'll easily tell where you need to go.. it's all about counter service here. The menu is easy to navigate as its short and sweet. Its a greatest hits of BBQ and you'll be hard pressed just to order one thing. Go ahead, order as much as you like, loosen your pants and stay a while. 

Ordering for us was pretty easy though we did cross section the menu, pork ribs, pulled pork sandwich, beef brisket, olive cole slaw, baked potato salad and cowboy beans. Get your drinks then grab a seat in the modern, cowboy space. They do serve beer as well as Coke products though I noticed something strange, most people were drinking water. Is that how they are dealing with the economy? Spend a little on food and cut a couple of bucks on the beverages? Good idea I suppose, coke is coke is coke, right? Water cleanses the palette and pairs with anything, sure Ill go with it! 

Okay, they called the Mr.'s name, my mouth is watering, my sauces are ready, good to go! First bite, the brisket, smokey, juicy and perfectly tender, the white bread under the brisket soaks up the meat juices, good idea, why didn't I think of that?! Next, ribs, oh no.. I can suck the meat right off the bone? Its not like I can suck a golf ball through a garden hose (well, Ive never tried)  it's just that the ribs are that tender! Dip in a bit of the spicy sauce, hellish good (I don't think they serve BBQ in heaven right? Smoke and flame thing, eh?)! Pulled pork sandwich, is melt on your tongue tender, I can see why so many older folks were ordering these sammies, no teeth required. 

Oddly the sides are in need of some tweaking. The baked potato salad was on the dry side but I have yet to have a baked potato salad that I like. Something about cold baked potatoes that don't do it for me. The cowboy beans had no real character and were only one flavor, a smokey sweetness that was good on the first bite but lacked depth. The olive cole slaw was different and while the Mr loved it, I'm just not a fan. However each plate was served with a bread and butter jalapeno, not only clever but addictivly delicious. 

Oh the desserts, simple and satisfying. Homemade Ice Cream Sandwich and a Sarsaparilla Float. We got the ice cream sammie which was 2 huge chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream. Nice crunch factor on the cookie with the cold smoothness of the ice cream, talk about a happy ending. 

On the way out the sun was setting the moon was rising and all seemed right in the world. Perhaps for the first time in ages, a calm swept over me and all I could smell was pecan smoke begging me to come back some time soon.  

Oh yeah, me and my O-face!"
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"3 years ago Chef Johnny Chu set out to bring a hot pot restaurant to the Valley of the Sun. If you're unfamiliar with Chef Chu he's the proprietor of the hip and popular downtown Phoenix Asian tapas joint Sens. Now his dream is realized with the opening of Tien Wong Hot Pot. 

Surprisingly his new restaurant isn't even located in downtown Phoenix, but in the city of Chandler. After talking with Chef Chu on my last visit he explained to me that this location was selected to prove out his concept, in an Asian neighborhood. Low rent and a discerning customer base, he can make all the necessary tweaks for success and will hopefully bring Tien Wong to downtown in the future.

For many the whole hot pot experience might be foreign since many of us are used to having our food cooked for us, forget that. The idea of hot pot while romantic and interactive, is all about you cooking various meats and vegetables in hot pots filled with flavored broths. Each table is equipped with a high powered induction burner where you hot pot is placed, and then you order as many different raw meats, seafood, vegetables and noodles as you desire. 

Once our order started showing up I become overwhelmed and confused, where do you start? What are the cooking times? What do I do? Before allowing my head to explode, I simply took a breather and one of the helpful staff to my aid. In my calamity I didn't notice the helpful hints on the welcome card. However it goes something like this, the broth boils, you drop in the thinly sliced meats, pull out, dip into one of 2 sauces, sesame and soy, then eat, easy. After only a few minutes of practice it all came together into a well crafted experience that's designed for socializing, romance and lingering. 

If you have difficulty choosing your broth, opt for the Ying Yang Broth ($5.95) which includes both the house original herbal broth and the house spicy broth with the later being the most complex of the flavors I've tried. Starting with pork stock, the addition of dried dates, ginseng, Schezuan peppercorns and dried chiles give the base heat and depth. Over the course of your evening the broth evaporates with cooking which adds to the intensity and enjoyment.

Not to be confused with the tips of peas, Pea Tips ($4) actually are the leaves and stems surrounding the pea itself. The tips cook fast and have both crunchy and tender qualities that taste so good either cooked or raw. By contrast the Korean Pumpkin ($3) takes longer to cook but the payoff is so tender you can even eat the thin skin.

Noodles include springy Udon ($3) as well as a Flat Rice Noodle ($3) which resemble chewy flat pieces of rice than a noodle in the traditional sense. Both cook up in a hurry and their absorbent properties are capable for taking in so much flavor. 

Sliced Wagyu Beef ($8) comes from one of the best breeds of cattle in the world. So its no surprise that the meat was flavorful and tender. Add an order of Lobster ($9), if available, for a surf and turf combo. Names aren't always accurate descriptions, take Sliced Black Pork ($4) which isn't black at all, the name refers to the pigs breed since it has black hair and skin. It's super tender and flavorful only taking a few seconds to cook thanks to expert slicing. 

Desserts feature 2 different kind of cheesecake, Strawberry ($6) and Green Tea ($6), both were light and satisfying, the perfect ending to Chef Chu's dream."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"It's no surprise I write this, but I love independent restaurants. Don't worry, I'm not going to get on my soap box and preach about how they help the local economy by keeping more of their revenues in the communities they serve. Nor will I go on about the way they support other small businesses by sourcing ingredients and supplies locally. What I love most of all, they take risks that many corporation restaurants wouldn't dare.

Take Maui Dog for instance, l mean really, who opens a restaurant specializing in Hawaiian style hot dogs? Ask owner John Stamatakis, who started his hot dog venture last year in the building that housed Ricky's Philly. The tiny structure has gotten the island treatment with tiki torches, bright colors and a warm friendly vibe. What they don't have in square footage they make up for in charm and of course menu offerings. 

The menu boasts a series of hot dogs, sliders and some serious toppings. There is one nagging question though, what's a Hawaiian hot dog? To be honest, I had no idea until I did some research. Ends up Hawaiian hot dogs are just like any other hot dog except for a slightly sweetened bun, some variation of garlic mayo and a laundry list of tropical flavors including passion fruit infused mustard to chopped banana and coconut. 

Before I go on about the food, I have to give you one bit of advice, ask them to make sure they steam the buns! On my visit this crucial detail wasn't fulfilled so what I ended up with were slightly dry and mostly stale buns. I made mention of this to the owner who quickly offered to replace the order, this is what I call great customer service. 

On first bite I felt deep love for MD's Lava Dog Shaggy Style ($5.50). Its a beef hot dog slather in lava, which is their house made chili, then topped with cheese and coleslaw, the later making it shaggy. I went further and ordered it Maui style, which means that it will additionally be topped with chipotle garlic mayo, Maui mustard, coconut and pineapple. I had no idea you could pile so much on one hot dog and still have it work. It's a whole lot of flavor but melds so well together. Fortunately the heat from the chili and hot dog also managed to make the extremely soft and what I love saying, squishy. 

Okay canned meat has a really bad wrap, nothing like congealed animal parts to make a person run for the hills. So bear with me when I say go ahead and try a Spam Slider ($1.25). Ordinarily I would have never ordered one but the lady at the counter assured me it was worth a taste. My only experience with Spam was my mothers doing, Span sandwiches, come on, you've had them too! Anyway, once you top a slice of grilled Spam with sweet mustard, coconut and pineapple, Maui style, I think you might have a different impression, sweet and salty is a great combo. 

If Spam isn't your bag, go for the Teriyaki Slider ($1.25), Maui style of course. This version replaces the Spam with a tender ground beef patty and a smothering of teriyaki sauce. 

If you love potatoes with your hot dogs and sliders, be sure to order a basket of MD's hand cut French Fries ($1.75). These are the real deal, tender with a slight crisp. If you want sheer crunch good times order up the Tater Tots ($1.75). These little chubs of shredded potato come out super crispy and well seasoned. 

Judging by the steady stream of diners, it seems like this indie resto is a hit with the locals. Just be sure to get those buns steamed."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"It was like some strange vortex enveloped the table and took us to another dimension.. from the second the waiter man handled my hot dog.. uhm, err.. let me start from the beginning...

We decided to wait a while before trying a the new corporate chain at Scottsdale Fashion.. you know how the weeks following opening day can be be well, iffy. So with that in mind and have tried the burgers at the Vegas location, knew that this might be fun. Insane huge menu, large portions and affordable prices. Upon arrival (parking is really bad since they tore down the east structure) we were greeted by a very friendly foh person and were seated immediately. The space is cavernous and was actually quite empty for a Thursday night. 

After looking over the book of a menu decided on the Kobe Beef Hot Dogs as an app.. Blue Cheese Salad.. The Max Burger .. and Short Rib Sloppy Joe. This sounds like a sort of high end Weinershnitzel or something? The server had 3 tables and she seemed a bit flustered when she finally approached us. She was a pretty neat person and was very friendly but after placing our order things started to go wrong.

After about 20 minutes our Kobe Beef Hot Dog app showed up.. seriously, come on, the place was empty! Well the dogs are stacked high on thick buttered Texas toast.. well when the waiter set them down he lost control and one of the dogs fell off the plate and onto my bread plate.. well, no biggie right? Wrong, he reaches over and grabs my hot dog with his bare hand while mentioning 'Jesus' as he was doing it. You'd think I would have at least gotten a kiss first? He puts the hot dog back on the serving plate and walks off mentioning he would get us another one. After about 10 minutes the manager comes over (very friendly) and gives us his apologies about the hot dog man handling. Fortunately he had a replacement with him and took the app off the bill. Let me tell you though, if you can order only one thing of the menu, these are it! Seriously.

Blue Cheese Salad showed up as a Chopped Salad *sigh*, drinks sat empty, bread bowl empty,  manhandled Jesus hot dog still in my head. The entrees finally showed up, this is a good hour after being sat in a mostly empty space. Just kept humming 'Things Can Only Get Better' (still love Howard Jones), ah happy place! The The Max Burger was room temperature and the cheese was just sitting on top in that sort of I'm trying to melt stage.. not good. At that point I was so over it! Now the Short Rib Sloppy Joe was pretty darn good! Piping hot and full of that familiar 'manwich'  flavor, reminded me of being in grade school again, those were the days. Hmm, now I remember why I was always the fat kid in school.. 

Ordered desserts.. New Orleans Beignets.. Deep Dark Fudge Cake.. and Banana Cream Pie.. after some time the desserts finally showed up.. the Beignets were HUGE.. Ive never seen a Beignet that large before.. comes with 3 dipping sauces.. while big they were just alright in taste.. I prefer the smaller ones as they aren't as doughy.. Deep Dark Fudge Cake, oh yeah! This was almost as good as the chocolate cake at Coronado Cafe.. dense, chewy intense choco- curl-your-toes yumminess! The Banana Cream Pie, well, just order the Deep Dark Fudge Cake.. not so much on that one.. thick hard graham pie shell covered with pastry cream, brown bananas and so much whipped cream you would think they were trying to hide something, hmm, brown bananas anyone?

I still think it was some sort of Vortex that we got sucked into. The nice manager came over and I joked around with him about my theory. Apparently he thought it was so funny he offered to take care of the desserts and invited us to 'please give us another chance'. He did mention that if they try to seat us at that table again, ask to be moved. Im not sure if I will come back to Grand Lux unless I bring a spiritual guide and a set of tongs for the manhandling hot dog waiter."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"Chef Matt Carter, already known for Zinc Bistro and the year-old The Mission restaurant, is getting a lot of buzz for his latest venture, Nine 05.

Named for its location at 905 N. Fourth St., the Asian restaurant occupies the former home of Fate. Carter and his team have completely changed and modernized the venue into an ultra-cool hip modern space.

The outdoor bar is great, and it comes with a weekend night DJ. The dining space outside is fairly large and can accommodate decent sized parties. With the cooler weather coming, this will be a good place to hang out for a drink and a bite.

Service at Nine 05 is what I like to call triple A: amazing, attentive and attractive. During two visits, my party felt so welcomed and taken care of, we almost wanted to take off our shoes and stay longer.

On my second visit, manager Jennifer Mara even remembered my favorite beer from my first visit, Xingu ($5). It's this kind of attention that shows in the service and every aspect of the experience, including the well planned menu.

Plate presentations are some of the prettiest I've seen in quite some time. During both occasions we shared appetizers, then each ordered an entree, which can be shared family style.
Portions are generous, and the chef does a fantastic job keeping things from getting too heavy.

The crisp, clean flavors of the Cucumber Salad ($8) was a great way to get things moving. The bright and light Octopus Sashimi ($12) had a wonderful flavor from the pickled chilies, more sweet than spicy, yet balanced, though the octopus was a little on the chewy side.

Fried items were piping hot, starting with the Tomato Katsu ($9), which was lightly breaded and nicely crisp. Beware of that first bite, these were hot, hot, hot! The heirloom tomato was nice and ripe resulting in deeply satisfying flavors.

The Rice Cakes ($7) had a nice crunch, but these were really to show off the tasty cilantro-lime coconut yogurt drizzled onto the plate. If I had a bowl of that yogurt I would have dipped everything into it. Good stuff!

Duck and Foie Dumplings ($11) were good, but I wish the foie flavor would have been more pronounced. It's a personal taste.

The Korean Chicken Wings ($8) were tender, crispy, meaty and interesting with the topping of chili threads. I've actually never had a chili thread before, so small and thin but wow, what a flavor explosion!

Entrees were a blast, beginning with n ample bowl of Red Curry Mussels ($18). These plump bad boys were made for the fragrant coconut and lemongrass curry broth. The chef also piles on thick slices of bread so as not to waste even a single drop of the complex elixir.

Eating the Pork Belly Fried Rice ($13) was a pleasure, savoring each bite of tender hog and sweet spiked caramelized pineapple. I asked for a side of their pickled chilies to add a spicy sweet dimension to the tender rice.

Be sure to use the chilies also on the Tonkotsu Ramen ($15). A huge steaming bowl of richly flavored broth and noodles topped with pork belly, scallions and an egg. You know how I get when there is egg yolk involved, the flavor just drives me wild, while it adds a certain richness to just about any dish.

Desserts ($7 each) are limited to only a few thoughtful selections. The Blueberry Mochi Cake was moist and chewy, adorned with fresh berries and a scoop of lychee sorbet was refreshing. However, I would have preferred a different flavor of sorbet, since I'm one of those few people who think lychee tastes like soap. It's just a preference.

The Coffee and Chocolate Torte was more my style. With its fudge-like texture and smooth and flavorful chai ice cream, it's real winner.

With great attention to detail, delicious food and a superb staff, I think you will find plenty to be happy about after a visit here. On my way out I couldn't help but think of an excuse to come back, then I was told that the lunch menu is outstanding. What a perfect reason."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"After so many amazing times at the old location, I'm happy to say that the new location is just as good. Now armed with a killer cocktail program (yes, a full liquor license), engaging hospitality, lush surroundings and the same brilliant Northern Thai cookery from Chef Chutima I have to say, this is by far one of my favorite restaurants of all time. While I will always hold the original Sahara location close to my heart, Im in love with LoS 2.0! 

Below is our goto dishes but be sure to ask about any specials they might have going on, you never know, you might be trying the next best thing. 

Appetizers: 
#12 Stuffed Chicken Wings. While these can be found elsewhere, the preparation here is a deep fried crunchy version that's amazing with pickled jalapeño and sticky rice. 

#13 A. Nua Dad Deaw which is Issan style beef jerky. Seriously, it's jerky so think deeply flavored slices of chewy meat. Its fun to eat especially with sticky rice and some of the accompanied sauce. 

#14 Nam Kao Tod. This is the premier LoS appetizer, if you can order only one app, make it this one. We call this one simply crispy rice with sour sausage. However its the little pieces of sausage arent sour but have a porky lime flavor thats addictive paired with fresh ginger, green onions, chili, peanuts and of course this is all nestled into a pile of light crispy rice. Served with cucumber chips, this tastes especially great when using the chili fish sauce condiment (the 4th condiment on the chili tray). BTW, if you prefer the sausage whole order #66.

Salad:
#45 Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad. Little deep friend pieces of cat fish with slices of apple and peanuts then dressed with lime juice.. Its bright, crispy and one of my favorites here. 

#59 Koi Soy. Okay so technically this isn't a salad but the coolness of this dish sits perfectly in the salad space for me. So what is it you ask? It's Issan style beef tartare. Yep raw beef and its a gorgeous dish with minced beef dressed with chili, rice powder and lime. We've ordered this at a spice level 4 and let me say that our faces felt like they were going to melt away. Order at a 1 spice level and add your own heat via condiments, trust me on this.

Entrees:
A. Khao Soi. Typical street food noodle dish but the version here is light years above the rest, like I'm talking golden standard here. We always order beef, but if you're feeling like a high roller get the beef short rib version. Its simple, toothsome egg noodles afloat in a curried coconut bream broth garnished with red onion, lime and pickled cabbage. Its rich, thick and a must order. 

K. Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry). This is one of those dishes that has a far reaching flavor profile. To me this curry could easily be on a table in India. Its dark deep pork richness is fork tender and perfect over steamed rice. However many prefer to eat this one with sticky rice. 

Drunken Noodles. We order this a couple of different ways depending on what the table wants. Most popular way is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass. The sea bass is lightly dusted and deep fried until its light and crispy. Inside the meat is tender, flakey and a great contrast to the rich smokey noodles. The other preparation for us is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Duck. Same as above but with slices of deep fried duck breast (no bones in either). The duck is rich, slightly fatty, salty and bursting with flavor. For me the crispy duck is my favorite preparation but then I also like heavier meat flavors. 

Garlic Prawns. So for the longest time we never ordered this dish as we thought it was just a Chinese style dish, boy were we wrong. This is where Chef Chutima works her Thai culinary magic. She takes large shell on shrimp and cooks them in such a way that the meat is tender and juicy while the shell is as light and crispy as a potato chip. Yes, you eat the shell, legs and all. This is truly a magical dish. 

Dessert: 
We're usually so full about now that desserts of sticky rice and mango seems just to heavy for us. Though look up my review for Luv-It Frozen Custard for a tongue cooling treat.

Oh and in case you're wondering the amount of dishes we ordered above are good for about 4-6 people. Though we're really big eaters so a party of 4 is more like it for us. 

So much love."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"Here in Phoenix I think that we are pretty lucky to have such diversity in each neighborhood. Particularly South Phoenix where you can find great Soul Food at Lolo's Chicken and Waffles, Pizza at Amano, and of course various different types and regions of Mexican food. When I say Mexican food I'm really referring to the sort of hole in the wall, real deal family owned operations that are all over the south side of Phoenix. So many of them dot each street corner and call like the Sirens of the night. Marisco's Playa Hermosa is exactly what I mean by this.

""We bring the sea to the desert"" is their slogan and it's so true. Stepping inside you'll feel like you were just transported to Mazatlán, Mexico, the only things missing here is the ocean. The place is just splashed with bright colors with hand carved tables and birds with a welcoming and friendly staff. With so much to take in it's hard to focus on any one thing, though with so many bird carvings hanging from the ceiling I almost felt like I was in the Tiki Room at Disneyland, less the chatter of the birds of course. 

Chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant can be a very good benchmark to judge the rest of your meal, Marisco's would have to be at the top of these tests. Their chips are slightly thick, warm and a little on the oily side, this way the salt can adhere well to them. Accompanying are 2 different salsa, red and green. The red has a certain sweet and hot bitterness that is tasty and even better when washed down with a cold beer. The green is made of creamy avocado and with a warm chip is absolutely delicious. Neither were very hot but that's the thing with real deal Mexican food, its not always hot and spicy. So you'll have no reason to expect the ""burning ring of fire"" the next day! 

With so many different and tasty sounding items to choose from, deciding was pretty tough as I really enjoy some good seafood. So imagine this, 8 large perfectly cooked shrimp, swimming in a creamy tomatillo and cilantro sauce, then topped with a sprinkling of cheese. If this sounds like something you would enjoy then go ahead and order the Camarones Culichi ($13.99). You will also get a basket of hot fresh corn or flour tortillas for dunking as well as rice, beans and a fresh lettuce salad dressed with lime juice. The beans have a nice texture with good flavor but the rice is nice! Well steamed and seasoned, the rice has a bright white color which might look bland, but after one bite you'll be wrapping it up in a hot tortilla and dunking it into the beans. 

The Mojarra Frita ($15), a fried whole fried fish, sounds and looks good, but decided to be more like a daddy's little girl and order something less involved. Crab Enchilada's ($13) are not only the house specialty but are good to the last bite. 3 corn tortillas over stuffed with sweet crab meat, rolled together with cheese and covered in a slightly spicy red sauce. Again with the rice, beans and salad this is a pretty large plate and for the money, a great value. The enchiladas were actually featured in Gourmet Magazine at one time, who knew?

On the back of the menu you'll find a section called Camida Mexicana which are plates of regular Mexican fare such as burritos, taco's and fajitas. Not trying the Carne Asada Taco's ($6.99) would be a real shame since the meat is so tender and the flavor so beefy. A plate full of 3 tacos, double tortilla, chopped beef and onions, with rice and beans is both satisfying and ample. Douse the tacos with some of the guacamole salsa and you'll have a party on your plate! The Quesadilla ($7.99) is just cheese and a tortilla, while good it was quite ordinary. However the smell from the Fajitas De Pollo ($10.99) was amazing! I'll have those to myself next time!

For dessert you can stick with maybe a Mexican Coke ($2) made with real sugar or a large glass of over ice Horchata ($2.50). Though for something more, the Flan ($4) was different than what you normally get. More cake like and dense than silky smooth, it was decent enough and a nice finish to so many savory dishes. Otherwise there aren't any other desserts offers, like you'll have room after such good sized portions anyway. 

Marisco's Playa Hermosa is a real gem and has the menu, friendliness and comfortable vibe to back it up. While the neighborhood feels a bit on the seedy side, as they say, nothing ventured, nothing gained?"
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"It was by sheer chance that we ended up going to Radio Milano. At the corner of 40th street and Campbell there are 3 different restaurants to chose from, the famed LGO Market and Pizzeria, Postino Wine Cafe and of course Radio Milano. We had every intention of eating at Postino Wine Cafe, but after we were told it was going to be an hour wait, our grumbling tummies knew weren't about to wait that long. Looking across the street at Radio Milano we scouted ahead to see what they wait was like over there, what luck, we were sat immediately!

Opened in June 2007 by the same folks who own LGO Pizzeria and Postino, LGO Hospitality, its quite the neighborhood dining destination. The only problem here is the lack of parking, though with complimentary valet service this shouldn't be much of a issue. 

The space has a laid back eclectic kind of vibe, barrel ceilings, lots of wood and brick and a funky soundtrack playing in the background, which provided a decent thump without being overbearing. Pretty much any where you sit the you'll have a view of the open kitchen, which Im a huge fan of. Something about watching the chefs making my meal just gives a place more of a homey kind of groove. I'm not sure how they did it, but the staff at Radio Milano is not only super attractive but friendly and extremely helpful.

Radio is know for their great cocktails, but not one person in our dining party ordered one as we stuck with glass after glass of Peroni ($5), a deliciously light Italian beer.

As you might be able to deduce, the food at Radio Milano is definitely inspired Italian with hints of moms kitchen. That mix might sound kind of odd but is most apparent in the starters and salads section of the menu. The appetizers are large enough to share starting with Toni's Deviled Eggs ($5). My mama makes a mean deviled egg so when someone decided to make one, the bar is set extremely high. Shhh, they add bacon to the top of theirs which trumps my mothers creamy delights, it's everything a deviled egg should be and more.

Shattered Potato Chips ($6) are made to order and like most parties, whats a party without chips and dip? Served with a creamy mayo and tomato sauce dip, these spuds were crispy along the edges and tender in the middle, these were woofed down in time flat. Another standout were the crispy bites of the Celery Ceasar ($9) which had us all cleaning the plate. The perfectly dressed crunch of the celery was a nice contrast to the creamy shavings of Parmesan cheese. The Tuna Crudo ($10) is an ample mound of fresh raw tuna dressed with a light citrus vinaigrette and served with shattered potato chips. I could have easily ordered another one for my dinner, very well balanced.

Main courses include pasta, fish and meat with a surprise or two thrown in, one of those surprises was the Lobster Roll ($19). A huge serving of tender lobster salad was spooned inside of a grilled buttery roll then served with shattered potato chips was amazing. Each bite beckoned for another and another though resist and enjoy each and every one. House Made Papardelle ($17) incorporated hand made ribbon pasta, sweet corn, tomatoes, seasonal veggies and goat cheese. Fortunately every table is equipped with salt and pepper grinders since notably the dish was under seasoned. A quick turn of the grinder brought out the sweet freshness of the vegetables.

Aqua Pazza ($23) is a fish offering which rotates frequently. This particular visit, the selection were 4 plump scallops served with sauteed spinach and roasted cherry tomatoes. While the scallops were decent they were swimming in an oily sauce. I think with the addition of an absorbant like potatoes, these would have improved from decent to great.

With only a few offerings Dolce or desserts were all that and more. You can order a scoop or scoops of different flavors of gelato which are made by the neighboring Grateful Spoon Gelato ($3-$5). Or go into a wonderfully sugar induced coma brought on my the Radio Chocolate Pudding ($7). Served in a massive glass complete with whipped cream, I'm not sure how you could eat here and not order this as waves of comfort wash over you with each and every spoonful. The citrus spiked Olive Oil Cake ($7) had a super moist crumb and finished with the delightful taste of olive oil.

Radio Milano may have been chosen by chance and circumstance but I assure you, when they re-open, future visits will definitely be on purpose."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"Now we stand at a crossroads; perhaps a dilemma. Is it truly Mexican when it's not made by Mexicans? Is a taco a taco just because someone said it is? Or a burrito? The philosophies and debates of Mexican food can go on for hours. But I like to think of it like this: If it tastes good, who cares?

This is the case with Two Hippies Beach House. Opened by the same Two Hippies, Andy and Jan Goldstein, who brought us Two Hippies Magic Mushroom Burger, they use words like tacos and burritos but never actually say they serve Mexican food.

What they do serve is an accessible, mostly delicious, well-priced menu. Really, any three tacos are $5, anytime!

If you've ever been to some of the surf shacks in San Diego, you'll notice it's like they picked one up and dropped it on the corner of Camelback Road and 5th Street â€"" sans the sand of course.

In true Two Hippies fashion, every square inch of this small establishment is absolutely covered with kitsch of all kinds; such blissful tackiness. The front is about the size of a postage stamp, barely enough room to stand after ordering at the counter. Once your order is ready, they call out your name. You can take your stash home or go around back and pull up a picnic table.

While you wait, take in all the decorations, though if you have some condition of OCD, you might have a problem with the clutter and want to start arranging and organizing. I had to put my hands under my seat so as not to give in to my secret urges.

The emphasis on the menu is tacos, as well as the hot dogs and lemonades. Two Hippies also can make any of the taco flavors into a burrito like the Red Beef ($5). The burritos are massive. If I had to guess, Iâ€™d say they probably are close to a pound. They are loaded with tender red chile beef, rice and beans, and they fill you up big time.

The Cheese Crisp with Chicken ($4.50) is also huge and fully packed with tender chicken, onion, guacamole, tomato and cabbage. Itâ€™s much lighter than the burrito but still very filling.

On another other visit I stuck with the tacos, ordering up the Taco 3 Pack ($5) and choosing fish, cactus and chicken. These tacos are massive, like all the food at Two Hippies. Youâ€™ll never leave hungry.

Interestingly, Two Hippies does not use corn tortillas, opting instead for the medium sized flour variety.

I'm always leery about ordering fish since we live hundreds of miles from the closest ocean, and on one visit my instincts were spot on. The fish was so strong I could only manage a few bites, even with the delicious red salsa it couldn't help that poor fish.

Although another visit revealed the fish to be spot on, flaky and mild, so the fish taco could be a crap shoot. The chicken taco was a chicken taco, good with a nice balance of veggies and meat. However my favorite was the cactus taco, tender sliced cactus topped with cabbage, onion, tomato, rice, beans and cilantro. The cactus had a delicate sweet flavor and with so many textures was a delight to chow.

Beach House also serves up several different topped all beef hot dogs. I had the pleasure of trying the No. 6 ($3.75), which is pretty much the kitchen sink model. A soft squishy bun covered with pinto beans, cheese, jalapeos, mustard, ketchup, mayo and guacamole. Whew, this is like the daddy of all hot dogs. I think this could have been even a plain dog and I would have loved it.
I'm not sure where they get their hot dogs, but the meat in this one was just so tasty, the toppings only added to my pleasure.

There are eight other hot dogs that also piqued my interest like the No. 4 ($4) that has feta, pesto-mayo, bacon, tomato and onion and the No. 8 ($3.75), which is covered simply in guacamole. I had forgotten how much I enjoy a good hot dog, look out Costco!

With 16 base flavors, the lemonades ($3) are a great way to to complete your meal. They use shaved ice so it's almost like having a slushy â€"" complete with a brain freeze if you don't take your time. You can also combine different flavors to come up with your own custom lemonade flavor. The fun part is trying your different creations. Cherry and raspberry were nice and tart, but one combo was even better, the strawberry and peach. For me this almost had a creaminess from the round flavor of the peaches, this could be my signature drink on any upcoming visits if there weren't so many other choices.

Two Hippies Beach House does a pretty good job of bringing the walk-up taco shack to Central Phoenix, and it certainly entices all sorts of people. So if you decide to check this place out and you see a big bear stuffing his face with a yummy hot dog or one of the cactus tacos, please feel free to say hi."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"I LOVE French food.. in fact when we travel abroad, me and the Mr always make a point to visit a Frenchie place in another city. So when I got wind of a new French place right here in our own backyard I was stoked! The best part, its owned by chef James Porter, who did amazing job over at the now closed Tapino, so my excitement turned to elation when our reservation was confirmed!

So now that I'm home from my dinner with the Mr, I guess I'm slightly indifferent. While they had a strong opening night, it wasn't the service or food per-se but more like the other diners. 

The dining room is small and extremely intimate with an amazing looking patio, we chose to sit on the inside. The interior is covered in wood, really, the floors, ceiling, walls but nicely contrasted by very stylish crystal chandeliers. I do have to say that I'm sure glad that they chose larger tables for the diners, since you can never have enough space. So there is plenty of room at the table to simply spread out and relax.

Service is pretty shiny and have no complaints, in fact our server was outgoing, attractive and knowledgeable. The bar staff was also very competent since both of our cocktails, Bohemian Sidecar ($9) and the Le Matador de Nimes ($9) were mixed perfectly and tasted great, putting us both into great moods until... a 6 top was sat down right next to us.. I know the old saying, you can't choose your family and in this case, you cant choose your dining neighbors either. They were so loud the Mr and I just looked at each other then decided to check email and stuff on our phones. We couldn't even talk which was a real bummer since this was going to be a romantic evening out. Anyway, the food will make up for it, right?

Of course I have high expectations.. new Foodiebear rule of life, never have expectations of anyone, or anything or you're going to set yourself up for irritation, heartache and misery. With that being said they were out of f*cking Pate! Can you believe that?! Out of the one thing that Ive been looking forward to this entire week. Opening night, first thing on the menu, first table in the place, out of something. I know, I know, things happen but come on, this is opening night!!!! *Sigh* Ended up ordering the Steak Tartar ($8) and the Mr ordered the Foie Gras ($10). Both were excellent both in presentation, quality and taste. While my tartar wasn't pate, it was still excellent with its fried egg on top and crispy potato crisps. The foie was much like the tartar, deliciously perfect and for the price, major value. In fact all of the food that we ordered was really big, surprising for the price points. 

Let me tell you what, the Onion Soup ($6) was prefect. In fact Ive never had onion soup that was that good! Perfectly sweet, savory and the right amount of cheese crouton to compliment the soup, not over power it. The Mr liked his Vichyssoise ($6) with it smooth creamy texture and a quenelle of salmon mousse in the center which added a smokey complexity to the soup. Again, the servings were quite large and could have been halved pretty easily. 

Entrees were a kind of hit and miss. The Mr had the Steak Frites ($17) which was well cooked but came covered in compound butter thaqt had anchovy in it. First bite I was immediately turned off to the slight fishy undertone. Thank goodness neither of us have fish allergies, very unexpected. The frites were nicely crisp and well seasoned. However the side of sauce for dipping was just strange. Was made from vinegar and had a decent texture but just tasted odd with the fries and the meat all together. Would have preferred something a little more basic, again a preference. I ordered the Porc et Lardon ($16) as my entree and Im pretty happy with the result. Grilled bacon wrapped pork tenderloin with roasted pork gratin which was made with roast pork shoulder, shaved fennel and celery root. The contrast in the flavors and textures was right up my alley aside from the tenderloin being a tad over cooked, it is again opening night.

Desserts were limited to three choices, Chocolate Brulee, Biegnets and Grande Marnier Souffle. We went with the Biegnets de Nutella ($6) and the Souffle ($6). The biegnets had a filling of Nutella which was alright but wasn't a fan until, I took some of the Mr's creme anglaise and dunked them into that. Delish. The souffle was so light and and was just brown enough to caramelize the sugar. You cant go wrong with either dessert. 

All in all Petite Maison is an excellent value and with Chef James Porter at the helm expect solid French fare nightly with breakfast and lunch being added soon. Looking forward to back soon but this time Ill go with no expectations."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"The heat was intense against the back of my neck. I could feel the sweat running down into the collar of my shirt and racing to the center of my back. As I looked at my friends across the table from me, their eyes were closed in fear of certain blindness, the sun was the enemy. All seemed okay once their sunglasses were positioned and the drinks arrived, though the heat from the north side of the restaurant was still there. Gallons of sangria could only temper the heat yet never conquers; we leave that for the soon coming night. 

I know I know, it sounds like a horrible start to a horrible experience, it wasn't really, I swear. Only a quirk in the new breakfast, lunch and dinner eatery located inside of the Clarendon Hotel. To be fair they were pretty busy and there weren't too many seating options available to us at the time, so we took what we were offered. The space is lined both the east and north sides with large windows that allow for great light and heat. So if you're fair skinned like myself or you're Vampire, ask to be sat somewhere away from the windows or you might not have an unpleasant experience. Okay, moving on now.

Like at many Mexican food restaurants you'll be served chips and salsa but GB does it so much better. Not only are the chips thick and crispy but also there are 4 different salsas to dip from including a smooth and creamy green salsa, which was a hit at the table. Be warned though, both red salsas are on the spicy side and while I love spicy be warned. If you'd like to have more fun dipping those deliciously crunchy chips, order the Guacamole ($7). This dip is far chunkier and interesting with nice large cubes of avocado and chili that'll give your chips reason and purpose. The taste is superb and fresh, it should be since each bowl is made when the order is placed, good stuff!

Have you ever heard of Chicharrón? In Latin American Chicharrón has many recipes but in its simplest, it's fried pork skin a.k.a. pork cracklin's or pork rinds. Hope I haven't lost you here because GB does a cool thing with this idea. Instead of fatty pork skin they use cheese and instead of fry they griddle the cheese till it's nice and crunchy then they shape it into a cone while it's still hot. The Chicharrón de Queso ($7) is then served with an aji aioli. What better to have cheese with than mayo, right? The deeply flavored cheese is also great with salsa and the guacamole. 

I can honestly say from a foodie perspective, tacos are as perfect as pizza. There's a balance of flavors and textures that really get me growling for more and GB don't disappoint. At $2 each you have a choice of pork, steak, and veggie. All are served on a fresh made corn tortilla and each with their very own adornments.  The fish tacos are made with eco friendly fish, I guess they drive hybrid vehicles, and are market priced. Shaved lettuce, pico de gallo and guacamole shored this tasty taco. The carne asada is made with grilled ribeye and has a covering of charred tomato salsa. Since these are only $2 each, why not try them all?

All the taco flavors can be also ordered as a torta for $7. Hot grilled telera bread piled high with tender ribeye and avocado was a sheer pleasure to eat. Well balanced bread to meat ratio and with just enough toppings to make the sandwich hold together perfectly. The tortas are ala carte so you might want to go ahead and order a side of French Fries ($2), which are house cut and well seasoned and are a wonderful compliment.  Of course they have one American favorite and they do it really well and that's the Cheeseburger ($7). This is after all a breakfast, lunch and dinner hotel restaurant so I think it's a given to have this on this menu. Perfectly cooked in all its great beefiness, this is an outstanding cheeseburger and even comes with French fries. 

GB can't all be spicy and savory; they also make some wonderful desserts that are worth saving room for. Take the tender Crepas con Cajeta ($4) which takes crepes, sliced bananas and peanuts then stacks them up for a nice sharable dessert. Though the peanuts were a bit chewy, I think crunchy peanuts would have made a better contrast, it's a personal taste though. My to die for favorite was the Postre de Chocolate ($5) which is a glass filled with creamy smooth house made chocolate pudding, then tops it with graham cracker pieces and marshmallow fluff. Seriously fantastic, all you need is a campfire, oh wait, the heat on the back of my neck will do.

Gallo Blanco is working on the sun issue and will soon have shades as well as an outdoor patio. A new place is always a work in progress and Gallo Blanco is certainly worth using a little bit of sunscreen in the meantime."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"**UPDATE** No word from the management.. guess I shouldn't be so sensitive.. The food there is pretty good.. just wish that the Mister and I weren't treated that way.. forgive and forget? Take the highroad.. at the yummy tortilla's?.. dial a clich?! LOL! Perhaps I shouldn't black ball this place any longer?? Help me to over come!! 


Well, I never! LOL! Tradiciones.. good food, good service, if you're Hispanic.. I sent an email to the manager with no reply and no surprise. I thought I would share my experience with you.

Dear Mr Braden,

I wanted to share our experience last night at Tradiciones with you. We have several friends coming in from out of town so the past Friday I had lunch and your wonderful restaurant. My friend and I had a exceptional time with great service (Mario was our sever) spot on menu items and overall were both very impressed. So I went ahead and made a reservation for a party of 15 with much excitement and anticipation. This type of excitement comes from years of dining and being a huge food enthusiast or foodie as my friends call me. This experience is in stark contrast to what happened last night.

My excitement carried with me the whole weekend so I decided to take my significant other there to have the same pleasure I had. Upon arrival we were amazed how busy it was and knew that a wait was imminent. After about 10 minutes I was able to make it to the front desk to put my name in for a table for 2. The hostess smiled at me and I told her 'dos', she raised her finger up to me and said ""uno momento"". Then she walked off and got another hostess, this was confusing as when she returned she started taking names of other guests and ignored me. Finally the new hostess asked me what I wanted. I told her I wanted a table for 2 she then told me that there was at least an hour wait. This was pretty obvious judging from the tens of other folks waiting for a table. Meanwhile the other hostess continued taking names then finally she added mine. I told her that we were actually here before the other guests the other hostess had written down. She ignored this and put my name on the bottom of the list. I'm not sure why she was acting like this towards me as there didn't seem to be a problem with any other guest besides the fact that I didn't speak Spanish. Our first instinct was to simply leave as it was perceived by us that we weren't welcome here. We stayed as the atmosphere still seemed lively and the smell coming from the grills were intoxicating.

After walking around the courtyard and enjoying some of the vendor stalls there we decided to venture back in so we wouldn't be missed. As we were standing there waiting I noticed that the patio only had a few tables and wasn't very busy at all. So we asked the second hostess if we could sit out there. She came back several minutes later to tell us the patio was understaffed and she couldn't seat us there though she offered bar seats instead. Perfect! We we're sat at the bar and were both excited to try the Cilantro Margarita! We ordered then, I saw her mixing it up, my mouth started to drool. She  then presented the drinks to us, cheers!  The drinks were wonderful and I'm not a big sweet drink fan. I then looked straight ahead and saw our bartender enter an order into the computer. As I watched her type I was amazed to notice that she named the check ""Dos Gringo's""! Looking around I could tell she was referring to us as everyone else around us looked to have been there for a while. She turned around and I asked her ""Dos Gringo's""? She smiled and started laughing like I caught her doing something wrong. She tried to explain that she gives everyone nick names and didn't make any apologies to us for the name.

Is it acceptable to call your non Spanish speaking guests Gringo's? I felt this was very offensive as I have generally heard the word in derogatory terms. Though this seemed to make sense as the way were treated at the hostess desk, were we just not welcome here? I continued to stew on this experience all the way until this morning when finally I decided to look up the word gringo to see if I were off base for my feelings. This is what I found...

gringo(gr&#301;ng'g&#333;) n.pl. gringos Offensive Slang, Used as a disparaging term for a foreigner in Latin America, especially an American or English person.

This solidified my feelings so I finally did some soul searching and decided to share our experience. If this definition is the case we will no longer visit your wonderful establishment, perhaps this will make a others more comfortable? If you can please help me to understand the term and the way we felt leaving last night I would truly appreciate your time.

Kind Regards,
Foodiebear"
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"Now with so many good things going for it, I did leave The Dhaba slightly indifferent. You see when I order and eat, I'm pretty much a total top. While I am open to suggestion, I have a good idea of what I want and how I want it. During my visit, not only was I flipped but I didn't have much say in the matter. Please don't get me wrong, our server was friendly however, every time when one of us ordered something, he would tell us that he would order something better for us to enjoy. For me, I was dead set on ordering several wraps and rolls called Sada Bahar, what I ended up with was far from what I originally envisioned. While I did get my way with a few appetizers, I have to say not only was I pleased with his domineering ordering selections, but would eagerly let him order again for me.

Street food called chaat, is to Indian cooking as dim sum is to Chinese. Usually a small plate with around 3 servings varying in preparation, and with enough variety to make a meal out of. Starting with the Amritsri Samosa Chaat ($6); these are a deep fried triangular dumpling filled with a mixture of potatoes, onions and chili, served with a spicy yogurt sauce. Perfectly crunchy and not a drop of oil, just breaking into one of them was a delight as the fragerent steam escaped, it was aromatherapy Indian style.

Ambala Tiki Chaat ($6) was more of a composed small plate. A couple of potato pancakes, layered with garbanzo beans, onions, and garnished with fresh mint & tamarind chutney and yogurt. The flavor components with Indian cooking are generally very complex, this plate was a great example of complexity and harmony. Each bite had varying degrees of spicy and sweet then a slightly sour finish from the chutney.

Complexity doesn't quite work like with the Kolkata Pani Puri ($6). These are round hollows, fried crisp and served with a watery mixture of tamarind, chili and potatoes. The idea is to spoon in some of the mixture into each puri, then pop into your mouth. While the texture was nice, the flavors just never came together and ended up just tasting weird.

This is the part where he took over and assured us what he was ordering was going to be quite good. As the dishes came out we weren't quite sure what was what, so we just dug in. Eventually we got clarity and just continued to share, family style.

Arriving on a sizzling iron skillet covered with peppers and onions, the Chicken Tikka Kabob ($11) was not only a dramatic presentation coming from the kitchen, but the colors were vivid and bright. Large pieces of boneless/skinless chicken breast are rubbed with spices then grilled, resulting in a beautiful yellow color. The chicken was tender and moist yet had a slight smokiness that added another welcome dimension.

Served in a large basket were piles of hot freshly baked naan ($3 per order). The thick and tender bread was a welcome site since I was wanting a wrap to begin with. Plain, garlic and chili each flavor welcomes dipping, wrapping and scooping of sauces and meats.

Loving yogurt, the creamy tang of the Kashmiri Chicken Tikka Masala ($10) was a welcome surprise. This is where the naan really came into play by making good use of the tender pieces of chicken and yogurt sauce. Sopping up as much of the delicious sauce as I could, interactivity is just part of the experience.

With so many different spices and spiciness, the Mango Lassi ($3) was as welcome as the rain. Yogurt and water mixed with sugar and mango was cooling and refreshing. With the addition of a fruit puree on the inside of the glass, made this version different than others Ive tried, though the effect was still the same.

At the end of the meal we were brought out a bowl of rice pudding with a scoop of pistachio ice cream. While the sliced dates and papaya were pretty to look at, none of the flavors made much sense together. Complaining aside, this did arrive complimentary. Who knows, maybe for being a good sports?

We were also brought out another off menu item, it was a thick, flaky and buttery paratha. Similar to a flour tortilla, this particular version was filled with pureed cherry and sprinkled with anise seeds. After only one taste we were hooked. The group of us made short order of the warm tender layers. You might have to ask for this one to be made special. Our server actually told us how soldiers in the hills of Afghanistan, would make these since it didn't take to many ingredients or tools. He stared blankly out the window as he told the story, perhaps of his own personal experience building make shift clay ovens?

Alright, so sometimes letting go can be a hard thing to do. After this experience, its actually kind of nice sitting back and enjoying the surprises the kitchen has in store."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"This latest hybrid might sound different but after trying the Filipino-Mexican fusion at Karey's Kitchen, you'll ask yourself why no one had done it sooner?

Situated at the southeast corner behind Blockbuster at 40th Street and Thomas Road, Karey's is in one of those blink-and-miss-it locations. 

From the good luck kitty at the register to the rich looking hardwood floors and dark wood furniture, it's actually charming. There are a few tables as well as counter seating for eat in, and the tables can be pushed together to accommodate a party of eight or more.

Karen, once an accountant, has turned restaurateur in this family-run venture, which includes her mom, Puring, husband, Ray, and brother, Michael.

It brings me so much joy to see the love and care that goes into a place that is family owned and independent. The warm smiling faces that greet you at the counter are so genuine and welcoming. Karen and Puring run the front of the store and tail it back to the kitchen to cook.

For the unfamiliar, many Filipino foods consist of stews, braises and roasts of beef, pork and chicken, which work perfectly for this concept. For the purist you can order a combination plate of classic Filipino dishes and select your own items, or you can go for something more unconventional, yet accessible, like many of its tasty hybrid burritos, chimichangas and flautas.

I must add the menu is more of a guideline rather than something set in stone. If there is something on the menu you find yourself craving, maybe call ahead to make sure she has it that day. Sourcing top quality has been tough, and on a several visits the restaurant was out of one thing or another.

Daily specials play a large part of Karey's menu, and there are always three to five specials per day. If you'd like to know about those dishes, you can choose to follow Karey's Kitchen on Twitter.

On one visit I created my own three-item combo ($5.99), which included a couple of out-of-this-world pork spare ribs. The barbecue sauce was house-made and had a wonderful slightly smoky and sweet flavor.

I also chose the chicken curry, which was fall-off, the bone tender and not heavy like most I've tried.

To round off the combo, I chose the pancit, which is the Filipino version of Chinese lo mein. Though rice sticks were used instead of egg noodles, it has a lighter sauce. Of course this was made to order and the vegetables were still slightly crisp.

The pancit is probably the lightest item on the menu and had plenty of chicken breast and vegetables for those who are watching their figures.

Adobo is to the Philippines as Pho is to Vietnam. Essentially a method of stewing meat brought to the Philipines by the Spanish in the 1500s, it has become the national dish.

Karey's version is absolutely delicious with its rich savory flavors and tender meats. You can have this in a combo or rice bowl, but do yourself a favor and get the Pork Adobo Burrito ($5.99). A huge flour tortilla stuffed with pork adobo then rolled in Parmesan cheese. With the outside rolled in cheese, it adds a depth to the burrito that I've never quite experienced.

With the burrito you also have your choice of Spanish rice, white rice, garlic rice or beans. The Spanish and garlic rice are moist and flavorful, but my favorite were the creamy beans. Karey's doesn't have a traditional Mexican salsa but instead chooses to use Asian chili paste. The spicy vinegary heat is the perfect complement to every dish I tried.

I love eggrolls in about any shape and form, including Karey's outstanding Filipino version called Lumpia ($2.95/$4.95). These are smaller than what you'd normally expect at an Asian restaurant, but the crunch factor is far bigger. Simply filled with seasoned ground pork and served with a side of sweet chili sauce, these little bad boys are fantastically crispy and light.

Keeping with the hybrid fusion theme, desserts are few but interesting and worth the calories. The Halo Halo ($4.95) is made of shaved ice, beans, purple yams, sweetened condensed milk and ice cream.

Okay, I know, it sounds a little crazy, and when it is served, the first thing that comes up is, ""What have I gotten myself into?""

This dessert is brightly colored and unusual in its presentation with so many different layers. Once you brave the first bite, it won't be your last. Creamy, icy, tender and smooth, it's a textural and flavor overload that should be experienced at least once. I have a feeling I'll be having another one on my next visit.

Ask about Puring's Cassava Cake ($1.29). It's served warm and is made from shredded cassava, coconut milk and sugar.

From the crispy lumpia to the tender, melt-in-your-mouth adobo, Karen and company cooks how they want to eat and treat their customers how they want to be treated, like family."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"Only open for breakfast and lunch, Hero Factory caters to the downtown Phoenix lunch crowd with humongous, top of the line hero sandwiches. With veteran deli owners Nicole Dorio and Jay Friedman, quality and freshness are high while the prices are low. Hero only uses Boar's Head meats and cheeses, which you've probably seen before in the expensive side of the grocery store meat counters. This makes all of the difference in quality comparison to the places, left unnamed, who sell $5 subs. You'll notice the difference! Then there is the bread! Covered with toasted sesame seeds, the toothsome bread has a light bagel texture, slightly chewy while remaining tender. No wonder since the bread is sourced from our own local Chompies bakery.

When you set foot inside the first thing you're going to notice is the smell. A mixture of onions, meat and tomato sauce fragrances permeate the air inside causing an instant and raging hunger. The deli counter is broken up into 3 different areas, each more moth watering then the next. The first case is filled with all sorts of delectable salads and desserts. Then there is the meat and cheese case, where the owners slice the meat to order whether for a sandwich or by the pound. Then there is the hot section which has steaming hot dishes of deli classics like sausage and peppers and meatballs, the fantastically overwhelming smell was quickly fingered. 

Ordering can be a bit tough due to the fact that everything sounds so wonderful. Signature Heroes both cold and hot, wraps, salads and sides make up the large and straight forward menu. Place your order at the counter, pay, then grab a seat and you'll be called when its ready. Once this process is started you can watch as your meat is sliced and your sandwich assembled. Ive always enjoyed watching my food prepared, you can learn so much for your own kitchen. Yes, Ive already ordered my very own meat slicer so I can do this at home on the weekends when Hero is closed.

The heroes at Hero are big, thick and piled heavy with meat, cheese and toppings. 2 big eaters can easily share 1 hero sandwich and a side no problem. Being the big bear that I am I did barely manage to finish one by myself and was quite miserable for sometime after that. Fortunately parking in downtown Phoenix is kind of spread out so a nice walk afterwards will really help out. The easiest method would be to park in mid town then take the light rail to the Hero Factory, it runs right by.

With so many heroes to chose from I went ahead and put my trust in the owner Jay. He immediately tells me that his favorite hero is the Manhattan ($7.95). Anything with ""man"" in it has to be good, right? A thick stack of roast beef piled high on toasted garlic bread all covered with melted mozzarella cheese. This sandwich was in its most pure form, no veggies and sauces to get in the way, just the simple flavor of good meat, cheese and bread. When he came to check on his sandwich I asked for some Russian dressing for a bit of a variation, this single element added that extra dimension that turned the Manhattan from good to great! Their Russian dressing is some of the best I've had. They really should bottle and sell this dressing, can't wait to try it on a salad! Of course the owner is going to know what's best to eat off of his menu. It was great that he didn't say the generic phrase, ""everything is good on the menu"".

Taking matters in my own hands, next up was the Crackerjack ($7.95). While not as anti-holiday as I was looking for this one was simply fantastic! Thin sliced cracked pepper turkey, oozy melted pepper jack cheese then dressed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and their amazing Russian dressing. Each bite of the spicy turkey and cheese was a hard contrast to the sweet flavors of the holiday; this one definitely has some heat to it. If something all American is more your liking, then the Patriot ($7.95) will be a home run! Roast Beef, turkey, ham and American cheese topped with lettuce, tomato and onion. You can never go wrong with the basics at Hero.

What's a deli without trying some of the home made salads? The cheese and bacon tortellini salad ($1.75 1/2lb) was so creamy, smoky and tender, one taste was not enough. In fact this one was so good I didn't want to share with my table mates. The deli case also had a tomato and mozzarella salad ($1.75 1/2lb) that was perfectly dressed with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Each cherry tomato exploded with sweet tangy flavor contrasted by the balsamic coated mozzarella, delightful.

The hours at Hero are limited to weekday mornings and afternoons which may be the only drawback to his location. Since the light rail is moving finally and more businesses are opening downtown, perhaps the hours will include a Saturday? I sure hope so, I really love this place!"
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"When I hear the words dim sum my ears perk up much like a dog when he hears someone approaching. Then a certain caution sweeps over me since so many dim sum places around the valley don't even come close to those found in other cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. So when a friend of mine and local ice cream guru, Helen Yung from Sweet Republic, told me about a new dim sum joint that reminded her of Hong Kong, I was elated to try it as soon as possible.

Phoenix Palace is quickly becoming a jack of all trades sort of restaurant. During the week they have seafood and Chinese buffets, a full menu with free delivery, and on the weekends rolling cart dim sum as well as a take out BBQ section. While carts only roll on the weekends, dim sum can be ordered any day of the week off of a smaller menu. We came just for the weekend cart dim sum, the BBQ section in the front of the restaurant looked amazing. In the window wrapped onto stainless steels hooks were selections of whole roasted duck, pork spare ribs and roasted chicken. I haven't seen a display like this one since being in Chinatown in San Francisco a few months back, very impressive. Come early or call ahead if you want to enjoy a roast duck to-go, when we left the display was pretty much wiped out.

Walking into the Phoenix Palace you'll immediately notice that you're not in Kansas anymore, the clientele is mostly Asian who have very discerning palates. You know you're in the right place when the target market is ethnic and not American. No worries about communication break down, the staff speaks English, even if it is a little broken. Though all you really need are your senses to guide you through the dim sum experience. After being sat, the carts will start rolling by your table to peddle their vast variety of dumplings. Each cart person will open a steam basket for you to take a look inside and along with a brief explanation, usually consisting of only one word, they stamp your tally card and move on. The carts don't come in any sort of order so just have fun and order away. If something looks even remotely good go ahead, it's really inexpensive.

One of the main difference between Phoenix Palace and the other dim sum restaurants, is the fact that not only do they offer 75+ different items, but here it's not only fresh but made in house. One of the carts that come about is a fry cart which at first seemed unusual. It's a stainless steel ride with a built in cook top where some items are crisped and heated table side which made perfect sense after one bite. In all of the places I've had dim sum, here and in other cities, I have never seen or heard of this before. Helen told me that she hadn't seen something like that since having dim sum in Hong Kong. If Helen is impressed, I'm blown away! We started with an order of Green Leek Gow ($3.15), with a translucent skin showing a silhouette of diced leeks and chopped shrimp, then crisped up on either side for a textural symphony. We also ordered the Pan Fried Pork Bun ($3.15) which had a slightly crisped edges filled with tender chopped pork, each bite was simply sublime. These were so good we ordered an additional plate of those chubby meat filled pillows.

The standards are done extremely well here, such as the Steamed BBQ Pork Bun ($2.15), as well as the baked version ($2.15) with its covering of sweet sticky glaze. If you've never experienced a BBQ Pork Bun in either incarnation, you really should. This is the all about savory, salty and sweet, dip in some chili paste for an added spicy dimension. Chinese Broccoli ($5.25) is slightly bitter, slightly sweet and has a crunchiness that pairs well with the softer noodle dishes like the Beef Rice Noodle Roll ($3.15). Long sheets of rice noodles are filled with sliced tender beef, rolled and then steamed. When delivered to your table, a lightly sweetened soy sauce is poured over the top. Shui Mai ($2.15) is as tender and flavorful as it was meant to be, porky and delicious.

Dessert dim sum is as much fun as its savory counterpart. Sesame Balls ($2.15) filled with sweetened red bean paste, surrounded by sticky rice, then rolled in sesame seeds and deep fried were pretty much a crowd pleaser. The Snow Bun ($2.15) was a new one that I've never seen or tasted before. A cloud of pure heaven filled with creamy custard, served warm, blew away any doughnut that's graced my lips. I also ordered a box of them to-go so they could be enjoyed again later. The tall and billowy Brown Sugar Rice Cake ($2.15) reminded me more of a yellow cake though was very good, hot and fresh out of the steam basket.

There aren't too many places where you can try so many different textures and flavor in one sitting. So it really is an experience to have dim sum with a close group of pals because food always seems to bring us just a little bit closer."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"It all started when a friend of mine suggested we try the place out, he dined with La Fontanella many times and was impressed with the quality of the food. Having been in a cold weather induced Italian mood, this seemed like a great idea. They have the location, ample parking and have large portions of hearty Italian dishes, a winner as far as I'm concerned. 

Walking into La Fontanella you'll be instantly transported back to a time when the Facts of Life was still on Prime time television. In a way this place kind of reminded me of the dining room at Eastland school where Blair, Mindy, Tootie and Jo would work, complete with old style wall sconces, hanging plates and antique looking furniture. While certainly dated to another age, this restaurant was impeccably maintained and cleaned. 

After being sat we were quickly greeted by our waiter for the evening, who didn't seem to happy to see us. While he was forcibly polite, his quick fire answers told another story. We just shrugged this off and went back to the reading our menus. 

With no explanation, large slices of bread and several pieces of focaccia arrived; accompanied by a bottle of herb infused olive oil, being hungry we just dug in. I enjoy hearing where things come from, is it baked in house, a bakery? I was able to pull some information; apparently these were both made in house. The focaccia was amazingly tender and delicious, with a smattering of tomato sauce over the top, eating one piece just wasn't enough. The sliced bread was nice and light and covered with sesame seeds which imparted a toasty nutty flavor. These also worked well as a vehicle to enjoy their flavorful herb infused olive oil.

We started with an order of Supplì ($3) which are Italian snacks consisting of a ball of rice around a piece of mozzarella, the balls are surrounded by breadcrumbs and then fried. Great creamy interior and crunchy texture, these disappeared quickly. Up next the Escargot ($7.50) were brought out and to our surprise, were room temperature at best. Apparently the waiter wasn't so happy about us bringing this to his attention since he raised his eyebrows and quickly snatched the snail away. I've never seen snails move so quickly and a few moments later our snails returned and were hot enough to enjoy.

I don't think I've ever met artichoke that I didn't like, so it was natural to order the Baked Artichokes ($8). The tender artichoke hearts were covered with a light tomato sauce and finished with fresh basil. While these were good, my only wish at the time was that they were hotter. Unfortunately like the snails, these were just above room temperature.

La Fontanella does make their pastas in house, including the pillowy light Gnocchi ($13.75). The creamy bites were light and also very filling so we opted to save the rest for later. Asking one of the waiters for a box seemed to be a mistake, he whisked the plate away and returned with the gnocchi wrapped in a carry away in which he literally threw onto the table and sped off. I understand they were a little busy with a large party but I'm not sure what we did do garner so much angst from the wait staff? I felt standing up and having a mommy dearest moment, but showing them my continued respect, decided to keep those intensities to myself.

Once the Chicken Piccata ($15.75) arrived I calmed down and purred with the first bites. Sautéed chicken with white wine, lemon, butter, capers and artichoke hearts was fresh and delightful. I wish I could say that for the evenings special, Lobster Ravioli ($22.75) that had such a strong lobster taste it was hard to eat more than a few bites. However the tender and delicious Chicken Alla Parmigiana ($15.75) more than made up for the shortcomings of the last dish. 

Desserts were in a class of their own. First the waiter brings out a tray that has wooden facsimiles of the plated desserts themselves. I thought this was kind of cool and did show attention to detail, actually some of them looked remarkably good.

The classic Tiramisu ($6.50) gets a twist with lemon custard in lieu of the layer of chocolate and egg custard. This was a bright and unexpected treat and with each fluffy bite, I felt kind of bad making the dessert disappear in such short order. Also being enjoyed was the Cannoli ($6.50), a fried pastry tube filled with ricotta cheese, chocolate chips and dusted with powdered sugar.

After paying our check and heading out the door we realized that the espresso that we ordered with dessert never arrived. We let it go and just chalked it up to a mixed evening at La Fontanella. Yes the service was surly and a few of the dishes were off but I think over all we had a decent enough food experience to return. 

Walking to our cars, I had to bite my tongue several times. I wanted to skewer my friend over the experience, though I kept it to myself, it wasn't like he was our server."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"I love beer. No I'm not talking about the mass marketed, mass distributed stuff that supposedly tastes great and is less filling. I'm talking about the flavorful heady craft brews that are interesting and actually flavorful. I enjoy beer much like I do food; it's a celebration of diversity, history and sensual stimulation, simply put, it appeals to all of your senses. One of the many cool things about beer is that it's like a meal in itself. With so many varieties to chose from there's bound to be one for every individual appetite out there.  Now where to get a great pint for a reasonable price?

If you're not familiar, Four Peaks Brewery has been serving up tasty pints in the valley for years. Having 2 locations and a loyal following of people who appreciate beer, tasty pub grub at super low prices, both locations are pretty hopping on most nights. If you've ever heard of Kilt Lifter and 8th Street Ale which are served in most valley restaurants, those are Four Peaks creations.  The Tempe location actually has the whole brewery thing going on in a large warehouse type space, which was a creamery back in the day that now has the massive stainless steel vats for making some of their most beloved brews. The Scottsdale location has a similar warehouse feel including a more private mezzanine level. The bartenders and wait staff are very attractive and friendly, which you know gets kudos from me and if one of them is sporting a beard, even better! Though with the case of our server, it was definitely style over substance, maybe a bad hair day?

Besides being with friends there isn't anything that goes better with good beer than good food. The menu seems to have been written with the beer in mind as well as used as an ingredient. The menu isn't super large but is easy to navigate with many salads, sandwiches and pizza's to choose from. Aside from everything being well priced, the portions are quite hefty, you won't leave hungry.  If you visit their website, be sure to sign up for the daily menu specials email. You'll receive 2 emails a day that features lunch and dinner specials for that day or night. The specials menu really gives the Four Peaks chefs a chance to be even more fun and creative. They can also be followed on Twitter as well as Facebook, isn't social networking great?!

Great meals here begin with a great beer.  You'll notice a chalk board up on the wall displaying which beer is available including its alcohol content. You can use this as a point of reference as to how loaded you might end up. So be careful with the darker beers, not only will they fill you up like a meal in a glass but tend to get you snookered before the meal arrives. The Portero Chingon ($3) was an amazing Porter full of dark complexities with hints of chocolate and coffee. Those notes for me paired very well with the BBQ Chicken Pizza ($14.50/$17.50) which had a nice sweet and smoky sauce loaded with tender chicken breast. Pizzas come in 2 sizes, 12"" and 14"" but the 12"" is of good heft and made a great appetizer for the table. 

To stand up to some of the stronger flavors of beer, the Bleu Light Special Burger ($9) with its thick juicy patty, hickory smoked bacon and smothered with blue cheese crumbles, was well grounded and a solid choice. Just to let you in on something, Four Peaks makes amazing beer bread it's similar to a really soft pita and makes for a great substitute to an ordinary bun. All sandwiches are served with your choice of beer battered fries, pasta salad or a garden salad; I went for the fries and couldn't have been happier with my choice. The fries are so light and crunchy you might finish yours and eat off a friend's plate and no I didn't do that. Yes I did.

Now some sandwiches are served natively on beer bread like the Grilled Chicken Beer Bread ($9). They start with grilled chicken breast then add sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms, green peppers, red onion, mozzarella and then top with a creamy cucumber sauce for a Greek/Mediterranean flare. Try ordering a Hefeweizen ($4) to accompany since the bright lemon notes tasted so great with the chicken and vegetables on the sandwich. Or, have a beer sampler with your meal ($9) so you can taste several different beers and see which one works best for your tastes. The melted Swiss cheese and the tangy sauerkraut on the Reuben ($8.50) tasted good with the Kilt Lifter ($4) but I'm excited to try the Oatmeal Stout ($4) next time.

Beer bread, beer battered fries and drinking beer, sounds like a beer fest right? It get's even more interesting for desserts, you wont find a Tiramisu like this one. Called the Stoutamisu ($5) they take espresso soaked chocolate sponge cake, then layer it with Oatmeal Stout lady fingers and chocolate mascarpone cream. Its feather light and a mile high though not as sickening sweet as many I've tried. Goes down like many of the Four Peaks brews, nice and smooth."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"If you've never been to downtown Gilbert to visit Joe's Real BBQ, Liberty Market is another reason to check it out. Not only are there those 2 destination worthy places to chow, but Hale Centre Theatre which offers live performance theatre for post eating entertainment. The icon for downtown Gilbert is a massive water tower that is just amazing to stand by. I know its just a water tower but the history, being built in 1923, and the scale, 123 feet tall, it's quite a sight to stand underneath. With a 3 million dollar renovation and new park surrounding the tower, it's both modern and well, cool. 

Here is some good news if you're a fan of Joe's Real BBQ or Joe's Farm Grill; restaurateur Joe Johnston also owns Liberty Market. So you'll know right away that there will be high quality and tasty food at very affordable prices. This is also due to the fact that Chef David Traina and his wife Kiersten are pretty much running the show at Liberty. Both were so helpful that we felt like we were honored guests; as I'm sure most will feel when visiting. Chef David came from behind the open kitchen and greeted us personally. His gorgeous wife Kiersten was so helpful as she had many recommendations from the menu and drink list as we ordered. Its customer service like this that will not only make you a loyal guest, but you'll quickly share this experience with your friends.

Built in 1935 the building has been lovingly restored into that retro-American-modern feel that the other restaurants have. On a side note, be sure to check out the bathrooms, there are several in which to chose and each has its own theme. To get things moving along at Liberty you stand in line and place your order at the counter, then they give you a number to place on the table and when your order is ready they bring it out to you. There are quite a few places to sit including a large patio, main indoor dining room and a long bar overlooking the wood-burning oven. This is the place to be if you love to see your dinner being made before your eyes, its up close and very personal.

Depending on what time of day you go the menu has its bases covered. From the coffee bar to a fun and interesting breakfast menu as well as the main menu, you might be hard pressed to just order one thing. The main menu is comprised of sandwiches, pizza's, salads and cold case offerings such a fresh hummus and potato salad. You may also be happy to know that they serve beer and wine to compliment your dinner choices, priced so well that you may want to try more than one if you're not driving.  Be sure to take a look at the wall of kitschy gift items like bear shaped salt and peppershakers and Party Snaps. Who didn't play with those when they were a kid?

Being all about fresh and local we started with the Antipasto ($11), which was large enough to share between 4 big eaters. A large serving platter covered in Molinari and Sons cured meats, roasted Brussels sprouts, baby carrots, olives and slices of artisanal cheese were a delight. The grilled bread that came with the platter was a nice compliment to the deliciously salty cured meats. Instead of ordering the Caprese Salad ($8) we opted for the Caprese Sandwich ($7), which even came with a cold case side dish. The corn, tomato + bean side was a bounty of freshness from the crunchy corn to the smooth toothsome Navy beans. This was a real compliment to the wonderful flavors of the mozzarella, sliced tomato, fresh basil and balsamic on the sandwich. The Liberty Joe ($7) is a take on the classic Sloppy Joe enjoyed by millions of kids over the years. Tender ground beef in a rich and hearty tomato sauce a top a toasted bun, lots of love for this one. Mac and cheese was the only side that could have been chosen for this one, kid heaven!

The pizza's are all hand tossed and baked in a beautiful Renato wood-burning oven. The pizza crusts that come from this oven are lightly crisp, slightly charred and simply scrumptious! Starting with the White ($11) this one is not to be missed! If the combination of cream sauce and smoked mozzarella wasn't enough, wait till you taste the chopped bacon and tender pieces of chicken, oolala! Another sure fire hit was the Grilled Sausage ($10) covered in stringy mozzarella, roasted onions and tomato sauce. While the Molinari ($11) sounded great, the cooking of sliced cured meats makes them way to salty and intense for my taste, gamey.

Desserts vary from day to day, so on our visit we had the pleasure of a slab of Red Velvet Cake ($5). If you've never had red velvet, please do. Moist chocolate cake covered in thick frosting of cream cheese delight. If you're in the mood for something a little different, order the Bread Pudding ($5). This was probably the lightest bread pudding I've ever had, which was more like French toast pillows swimming in a sea of creamy love.

Load up the car with friends and go ahead, make the trip to Gilbert and see what you had no idea existed."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"We've been eating at LOS for years and have been there so many times that luckily we've managed to order most of the menu. However we have 2 different ways we order when visiting LOS. The first way is just me and my hubs on a casual weeknight, we tend to order the few dishes that we haven't tried yet . The other is a weekend night with several guests along for a Thai feast. So this review will focus on the later, a sort of best of LOS if you will.

On a side note you do not come here to order Pad Thai and the other super popular Thai dishes. LOS is famous for Northern style and Chef Chutima specialties, stick to those and you will not be disappointed. Also, LOS has 4 condiments but be sure to ask for all 4.. chili paste, chili powder, pickled jalapeño will be brought out in a caddy but the 4th is separate.. its thai chili in fish sauce and lime juice, you'll have to ask for this one. When they bring it lift the lid of carefully and inhale the fragrance. This to me is the LOS perfume and let me tell you this condiment is scorchingly hot. Its burns both ways but it tastes truly amazing! 

Apps..

#12 Stuffed Chicken Wings.. while these can be found elsewhere, the preparation here is a deep fried crunchy version that's amazing with pickled jalapeño and sticky rice. 

#13 A. Nua Dad Deaw which is Issan style beef jerky. Seriously, it's jerky so think deeply flavored slices of chewy meat. Its fun to eat especially with sticky rice and some of the accompanied sauce. 

#14 Nam Kao Tod.. this is like the premier LOS appetizer, if you can order only one app, make it this one. We call this one simply crispy rice with sour sausage. However its the little pieces of sausage arent sour but have a porky lime flavor thats addictive paired with fresh ginger, green onions, chili, peanuts and of course this is all nestled into a pile of light crispy rice. Served with cucumber chips this tastes great using the chili fish sauce condiment. BTW, if you prefer the sausage whole order #66.

Salads..

#45 Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad.. little deep friend pieces of cat fish with slices of apple and peanuts then dressed with lime juice.. Its bright, crispy and one of my favorites here. 

#59 Koi Soy.. okay so technically this isn't a salad but the coolness of this dish sits perfectly in the salad space for me. So what is it you ask? It's Issan style beef tartare. Yep raw beef and its a gorgeous dish with minced beef dressed with chili, rice powder and lime. We've ordered this at a spice level 4 and let me say that our faces felt like they were going to burn off. Order at a 1 spice level and add your own heat via condiments. Trust me on this.

Entrees..

A. Khao Soi.. typical street food noodle dish but the version here is crazy good. We always order beef with this but if you're feeling like a high roller get the beef short rib version (you'll pay more but its marginally more tender). Its simple, toothsome egg noodles afloat in a curried coconut bream broth garnished with red onion, lime and pickled cabbage. Its rich, thick and a must order. 

K. Kang Hung Lay (Pork Stew Northern Curry).. this is one of those dishes that has a far reaching flavor profile. To me this curry could easily be on a table in India.. its dark deep pork richness is fork tender and perfect over steamed rice. However many prefer to eat this one with sticky rice. 

Drunken Noodles.. we order this a couple of different ways depending on what the table wants.. most popular way is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Sea Bass with extra noodle. The sea bass is lightly dusted and deep fried until its light and crispy. Inside the meat is light, flakey and a great contrast to the rich smokey noodles. The other preparation for us is Drunken Noodle with Crispy Duck. Same as above but with slices of deep fried duck breast (no bones in either). The duck is rich, slightly fatty and bursting with flavor. For me the duck is my favorite preparation but I also like heavier meat flavors. 

Garlic Prawns.. so for the longest time we never ordered this dish as we thought it was just a Chinese style dish, boy were we wrong. This is where Chef Chutima works her Thai culinary magic. She takes large shell on shrimp and cooks them in such a way that the meat is tender and juicy while the shell is as light and crispy as a potato chip. Yes, you eat the shell, legs and all. This is truly a magical dish for us. 

Dessert.. 

We're usually so full right about now that desserts of sticky rice and mango seems just to heavy for us. Though look up my review for Luv-It Frozen Custard for a tongue cooling treat (its close to LOS).

At some point in the future I will write a companion review to this review for those who want to explore other dishes but have been overwhelmed with the scale of the menu. Oh and in case you're wondering the amount of dishes we ordered above are good for about 4-6 people. Though we're really big eaters so a party of 4 is more like it for us. 

Bon appetite!"
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"In this day and age of many pizza concepts around the valley sometimes it's tough to figure out which one you actually want to visit. For me it really has to be a complete package for me to sit down and spend my hard earned money. In my years of package peeking I think I've become quite the expert and can quickly sum up if it's worth exploring or not.

One part of this package is coifed, bobbed, styled and blown; Salon de Venus was making women beautiful for 58 years in the same location on Camelback and 19th Street.  The star shaped bricks along Camelback are unmistakably Phoenix and remind me of being a wee package peeker growing up in the valley. The new owners Dan and son Aric Mei deserve so much credit for preserving the wall and repurposing many of the items used in the old salon space. Every time we turn around there is something being ripped and bulldozed over to make way for the new with no respect to the old, hats off to them for their thoughtful redesign. What has been done to the new space is simply amazing. The sheer volume and proportion of the main dining room while open, has a sense of coziness and interest with the use of wood and other recycled materials. You can tell that the building is special and well thought out with so many details you can discover something different on each visit. 

Since the space is so well designed and inspired, what about the menu? Created by two local chefs, Jared Porter and Jerry Alday, the duo has seemed to have created a delectable menu based on their own experiences using fresh local and seasonal ingredients. There is definitely a sense of this commitment walking up the path to the entrance. They have many of their own herbs, vegetables and citrus growing right there in planter boxes. I even noticed several eggplants growing which I hope to be lucky enough to try on an upcoming visit. While the menu is pizza centric, there is also a varietal of sandwiches, salads and pasta. For the kid-set there is a section just for the younglings to choose from. Aside from Mac and Cheese, this part also includes a B.L.T. for the more sophisticated baby-foodie, how cool is that?

Looking at a great package I like to allow myself to enjoy other more subtle parts of the package, in this case the balls. Arancini ($8) which are big and satisfying balls of creamy risotto, deep fried then served on a bed of pomodoro sauce. These are some of the tastiest balls I've had in ages and are a must when ordering. Having a similar impact is the Cauliflower Gratinata ($7) that uses cauliflower mixed with aged white cheddar cheese and topped with breadcrumbs then roasted. Basically a cauliflower au gratin, it's a delight to scrape some of the baked cheese off the side of the dish and spread onto a slice of grilled bread. For something a little bit different, the Eggplant Cannelloni ($8) uses slices of tender eggplant in place of pasta. The slices are still stuffed with cheese and served on top of Parlors wonderful pomodoro sauce sans the heaviness usually associated with pasta dishes. 

On the lighter side, salads are done very well and almost all come in 2 sizes depending on your appetite. On one visit Parlor was actually offering a salad special that was composed of shaved cabbage, Queen Creek Olives, sliced cucumber, cherry tomatoes and cubes of fresh avocado with a refreshingly addictive oregano vinaigrette ($9.50). In a similar preparation, the on menu Parlor Insalata ($6.50) showcases some of the freshest veggies with the addition of crispy chickpeas and salami which both add a heartier dimension to this robust salad. 

While the heat coming from the wood-burning oven couldn't be felt, you can imagine the waves of sultry wind as your face closes in on the best part of the package.  Coming in at 8"" and 12"" sizes, you can have it a few different ways, your way or the chef's way. Though why limit yourself to just 8"" when you can have 12"", right? The 12"" is plenty to share between 2 diners with decent appetites since the crust is light and thin. The wood burning oven and the chefs do a great job of combining the perfect yin and yang of slight char and crispy golden perfection, Parlor has some seriously great crust! Yukon Gold Potato ($10/$14) is so simply built its near perfect. Roasted potato, gorgonzola cheese, leeks and pancetta has that sort of down home accessibility you might actually finish a whole one by yourself. 

Desserts are treated with much thought here but are kept simple and satisfying. Seasonal Fruit Skillet ($7.50) was much like a fruit crisp that mom would make. Made with the tastiest fruit then topped with a layer of pastry and baked until just right, was only made better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Taking my time with each bite, savoring the quality and preparation, it's the smaller moments in life that can be so memorable. So when you get a chance go ahead, take a peek at that package, you'll never know what you might find unless you look."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"When growing up I loved to watch TV.  I was the chubby kid so going outside and playing wasn't much in my vocabulary as I was always taken away to a fantasyland of programming that would appeal to me so.  Inevitably you'd see reruns of all the beloved favorites, I Dream of Jeanie, Bewitched and Wild Wild West.  But there was one rerun that really caught my eye, Bonanza.  It's not that I liked Westerns or anything like that; it was because I loved looking at the cast.  Those tight jeans clad Cartwright brothers were the dreams of young raging hormones and many afternoons of happy time. 
 
After happy time I would always be ready for something to eat.  Food would almost certainly ease the loneliness of growing up the chubby kid, where is that wall of man Hoss Cartwright when a kid needs a hug?  I know where he was at; probably back up at the ranch house making something to eat! Sierra Bonita Grill, it's like that ranch house.  Low hanging ceilings with exposed wooden rafters and a wonderfully smoky just used fireplace smell, you'd think those Cartwright brothers would saunter in at any moment. 

Sierra Bonita is the sister restaurant of the fantastic Phoenix City Grille, which also seems to pay homage to Arizona and the old west with its styling and menu selections.  Sierra is just more into the cowboy thing with the sort of cowboy chic and down home friendliness but not enough to be cheesy and contrived.  Outdoors there is a wonderfully cozy patio area for complete with fans for the warmer evenings.  I'm looking forward to cooler temperatures later this year so I can bask in the glowing heat of their gorgeous fireplace. 

There isn't much of a better way to get settled into your evening than with one of Sierra Bonita Fresh Squeezed Margaritas ($8).  These tart and heavily liquored versions will take the edge off of any bad day you might have been having.  I make a mean margarita at home so when I say I love these margaritas it really means a whole lot, it's the fresh juice!   After easing into your margarita, looking over the menu will be more of a challenge since everything sounds pretty good.  Like those Cartwright brothers, they sure make them big at Sierra Bonita. The portions are pretty large so be warned when ordering, big eaters will rejoice as I did when the first plates went down. 

Fresh seems to be more of a way of life than simply a word.  The Guacamole ($9) embodies the word in its wonderful bright green color and just smashed taste.  If you've never had fresh guacamole before this version is a great way to bust your cherry, so to speak.  The accompanied 3 salsas were all very flavorful including a roasted chile flecked smoky salsa, a fresh chopped pico de gallo and a tangy tomatillo.  The large salty thick cut tortilla chips were sturdy and crisp enough to hold up to scooping chunks of avocado and tomato, scrumptious. 

Mini Quesadillas ($7) are a plate of 3 small corn tortillas filled with spinach, cheese and huitlacoche.  The huitlacoche aka corn smut, is actually a fungus that grows on corn and is widely viewed as a delicacy, I think you either love or hate it.  The taste is earthy in a good mushroom kind of way but can tend to be slightly pungent.  In the case of the quesadillas, the flavor was indeed earthy and meshed very well with the other flavors.  Instead of salsa with the quesadilla, they have chosen to serve a delicious black bean and hominy relish.  It's the little choices that seem to make a difference when we're talking about food. 

Tacos seem to be on pretty much every menu these days.  They are simple, tasty and easy to make, however all aren't created the same way.  Take the Carne Asada Tacos ($10) for example; the beef is prime and extremely tender though the real difference is the use of pesto mayo, salsa fresca, shredded cabbage and penela cheese for an interesting play on flavors. 

When I took my first bite of the Buttermilk Chicken ($17) I was taken back to the time of being a kid and loving my mothers cooking.  Generously seasoned and sublimely tender this is some great chicken.  They lightly pan fry it then finish it in the oven so it's ever so lightly crispy but ever so heavenly.  Included is a pile of mashed sweet potatoes and asparagus spears all slathered in cracked peppercorn gravy just dreamy.   

What's a cowboy place without something sweet to finish it all off?  Naturally there is Bread Pudding ($6) but the Buttermilk Pie ($7) seemed like the most unusual choice.  This gamble paid of in spades, the pie was choice! The texture reminded me of a cross between cheesecake and flan with the flavor being something like the later.  The pie is wadding in a pool of caramel sauce that tasted house made and with being so sweet, is meant to be shared.  One bite of the flaky crust and that may not happen.

If you ever have a hunkin' hankerin' for some down home cowboy chow, Sierra Bonita Grill will induce a feeling like happy time with the Cartwright brothers."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"""Cook with love, cook like you mean it."" These are wise words coming from hard working local chef and restaurateur Tottie Kaya. After several visits to her latest outpost, Tottie's Asian Fusion 2, I'm thoroughly convinced that she cooks some of the best Asian food in town.

Her latest outlet is located at Lincoln Village near the intersection of Scottsdale Road and Lincoln Boulevard. The space she chose has been at least 3 different restaurants that I know of, the last being an Italian eatery. The owners of Lincoln Village are spending millions to make sure that the buildings are more accessible and observed from the street. To help guarantee her latest venture will be successful, she uses feng shui to create and direct a balance of energy in the space. Not only is their a sense of volume with the high ceilings, but the dark wood floor and furniture speak a casual elegance that will invite you to linger over a ochoko of sake.

It's an Asian tour menu featuring items from Thailand, Vietnam and China. ""Each dish has a balance, salty, sweet, sour, umami"" as Tottie described when talking about her dishes. High quality ingredients are sourced through local purveyors including multi-weekly trips to LeeLee Asian Market for amazingly fresh basil and other essential herbs. These flavors come through with every bite as you make your way through a plate of Tottie Rolls ($7.50). Crispy deep fried rolls filled with a mixture of ground pork. Many of the appetizers are interactive, in this case you wrap a roll in a lettuce leaf with added cilantro and mint. Then dip into Tottie's version of the Vietnamese condiment nc chm, a slightly sweet vinaigrette dipping sauce. The all so tender Sugarcane Chicken ($9.95) gets the same hands on treatment. Minced chicken meatballs skewered onto sugarcane but this time you dip into an out of this world peanut sauce. If peanut sauce is your thing, don't miss out on the ultra moist Chicken Satay ($6.50). Both come with a flaming pot to add an additional element of crispiness and char to each piece, thoughtful.

Tottie's mastery of balance and presentation is apparent in the Sizzling Rice Soup ($7.95). Hot toasted rice is poured over a large serving of stock including vegetables and shrimp; creating a loud sizzle that will turn the heads of fellow diners. The flavors of this dish are mild and delightful but the key to pure enjoyment is the contrast in textures. Adding a small spoonful of the house made chili oil adds heat and a slight toasty sweetness.

Salad lovers will enjoy the bright and sweet Mango Shrimp Salad ($11.50). This salad is piled with large tender crustaceans and sliced mango seasoned with ginger, mint and lemon. The classic Vietnamese salad Bun Tom ($9.50) is paid a loving tribute. A large bowl filled with rice noodles and charbroiled pork, shrimp, Tottie rolls, lettuce and mint is so light, yet oh so satisfying.

Noodle addicts can rejoice with the chewy chow fun laden Pad Kee Mao, with your choice of chicken ($9.95), beef ($10.50) and shrimp ($11.95). You indicate your level of heat from mild to spicy however the sauteed vegetables add crunch and cool. If you you'd prefer to go all out order Tottie's Pan Fried Noodles ($11.95). A massive pile of egg noodles are fried crispy on the outside tender on the inside are covered with veggies, beef, chicken and shrimp. The light brown sauce does a great job getting into every nook and cranny of the noodle cavern.

There are also Chinamerican dishes offered for those seeking comfort classics such as General Tao's Chicken ($9.95), Kung Pao Beef ($10.50) and Shrimp with Garlic Sauce ($11.95). If you don't see something on the menu that suits you completely, just ask and they can make adjustments for dietary restrictions and allergies. Tottie is an expert at preparing meals on the fly or if you're not sure what you'd like to have, just leave it to her and she will take great care to make sure you have something tasty.

Desserts seem sinful and richly decedent, though surprisingly are all dairy free. You'd never know after a taste of her smooth and luscious ice creams; all made with coconut milk. She makes 8 flavors and flavors do change often, to get the most out of a visit we ordered the House-Made Ice Cream Sampler ($12.95) which has 8 different flavors. Favorites were the coconut, pineapple, avocado and the intense Vietnamese coffee, but I did find myself licking the bowl clean of the rocky road. For something not quite as rich the Pumpkin Custard ($6.50) not only clears up any residual spicy heat from dinner but felt like good healthy eating. That feeling of healthful lightness also comes when ordering the freshly sliced Mango with Sticky Rice ($6.50). Sweet and tender mango resting on top of sticky and chewy rice with a drizzle of sweetened coconut milk was a delight.

While Tottie's most certainly has great service and killer food, it's her heart, soul and passion that goes into this place that makes it truly stand out."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"When they say neighborhood, they aren't kidding, literally in the Coronado residential neighborhood at 12th street and Oak, the restaurant lives in an old building that once housed the Arizona Showmen's Association. The rehab has been lovingly restored by its owner DJ Fernandes who is also not by coincidence an architect. When pulling up you can see such attention to detail and design from the concrete stamped handicapped spot, to the interesting lights and exterior brushed stainless door pulls. When entering the building be sure to check out the signage made up of letter building blocks, clever and grounding. Rehabilitation like this helps make the Phoenix area so interesting and original.


The inventive menu was designed by DJ, his girlfriend Jessica Ruiz and chef/consultant Mitch Hoverman, who interestingly also opened Palette. The idea is to share plates amongst a group of friends, though you can easily put together a traditional 3 course meal if that is what suits you best. We opted to share our plates so we could try as many as possible. To best describe the menu it would be eclectic, with Creole, French and Spanish twists. There are 3 sections to chose from, Start, Smaller Plates and For Sharing, the menu is accessible and interesting.

Starting things out, while the grilled baguette ($5) might sound ordinary, its crispy and light goodness comes from Simply Bread. Accompanied is a whole head of roasted garlic and finished with Bariani olive oil. The Bariani is essentially liquid gold with its grassy mild and pure unfiltered flavor. If there is any left in the bowl when you're done don't let the waiter take it away, it's to precious to be wasted and will taste great on just about anything. Together with the nosh plate ($7) it's all about simple clean flavors. Salted melon, Molinari &amp; Sons salami, manchego cheese and toasted pistachio's were so delicious it was hard to share though there was plenty for all. Panko walnut-crusted fontina ($6) was perfectly crunchy and with each bite the melted strands of the fontina cheese were delightful and satisfying. Patatas bravas ($5) are classic tapas however the Tuck version turns potato cubes into long thick planks served along side of 2 dipping sauces. The planks were lightly crispy and well seasoned, though dipped into the aioli and the spicy tomato sauce together was good, love came from dipping into the remaining Bariani olive oil.

Working into the Smaller Plates menu, the panini bites with prosciutto ($9) were so good we were squabbling over the last piece. A nice slab of ciabtta bread stuffed with grilled pear, taleggio cheese, arugala and honey was a sweet and savory combo that has to be tasted and savored. Order 2, one for the table and another wrapped up to go for lunch the next day. Another contrasting sweet and savory small plate would be the medjool dates stuffed with chorizo and topped with melted gruyere ($9). I've had many of stuffed dates, but never like this, spicy and sweet, chewy and meaty, very nice! The mac and cheese with crispy prosciutto, topped with breadcrumbs and lobster ($12) was sublimely creamy and tender, like a really good hug where you just melt into his arms, bury your face into his chest while you're enveloped in comfort and security. Who knew mac and cheese could make you feel so good?!

Turning our attentions to the citrus-brined fried chicken ($17) was a sight to behold. 3 large, generously battered pieces of deep fried passion caused instant salivation. I have to say that this was the juiciest tenderest fried chicken I've ever had the pleasure of sinking into. The crunchy coating, the moist flavorful chicken and the slight citrus after taste were absolute perfection. Along side was a large white cheddar waffle, slathered in maple butter and a bowl of pork laden collard greens. The waffle had a light, fluffy and almost mashed potato consistency that was fork tender and soaked up the chicken juices easily. The collards were nice and porky with that slight bitterness only tempered by salt and sugar.  This plate was simply amazing!

For the beef eaters there is a spiced skirt steak ($18) served with parmesan lentil mashed yukons and mushrooms, that was so hearty and delicious, I can't imagine having this anywhere else.

There is usually only one way to finish a good meal like this and that's with my favorite self proclaimed food group, chocolate. We all tore into the chocolate brownie and almond cream ($7) with a vengeance. You could tell with each bite that this was no box mix, crackly shininess on top, moist and crumbly, this was a great brownie. If this is too much you will also a receive a 1 bite postre with your check. On this night it was raw chocolate chip cookie dough with a slathering of melted dark chocolate, happy ending!

The stars are aligned for the Tuck Shop. With all of their elements in near perfect cohesion, this will soon be one of the coolest and freshest places to eat, drink, and of course share."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"Opened in 1970, La Piñata, a family affair, has been dishing up Sonora style Mexican food for 39 years. Walking into the restaurant you're immediately transported back to 1970. No time machine required, thanks to dark orange vinyl booths, plastic wood laminate tables and stucco walls. The only element missing were the traditional Mexican dresses. Though it something feels like it wasn't that long ago when those may have been retired. Even in the 70's style, La Piñata is relaxed, like going to a friend's house for dinner. The dark orange vinyl might be original but you can tell this place is loved and well cared for.  Not a strip of duct tape anywhere!

Starting with chips and salsa is almost always pure happiness. Hot and crispy, slightly salty paired with thick chunky salsa, a real bargain at free. Be warned if you think thick and chunky means mild and bland, far from it. On first bite the fresh tomato flavor bursts into your mouth followed quickly by a smack of the spicy chili heat. The 2 contrasts work so well together that it's quite difficult to stop eating until the bowl is empty. Cleverly hidden in the back as to make it more special, is another salsa, this one being almost as spicy and slightly sweet. Many Mexican restaurants have a spicier salsa they keep in back and will only bring out if requested. Ask for this one and your server will happily bring you out a dish.

For lunch La Piñata offers a variety of specials. There's a Taco in My Burro ($4.95) that uses a large flour tortilla, filling it up with ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and onions.  Try getting your mouth around this one! Letter F ($8.95) combines a taco of your choice and a cheese enchilada served with rice and beans. The shredded beef taco was decent but it was the cheese enchilada that rocked this plate. The sauce was so wonderfully creamy you couldn't tell where the sauce ended and the melted cheese began.   A dozen of these wouldn't be enough!  A, Taco Salad ($6.50) could be considered a lighter option if the deliciously crunchy shell was missing. Who wants to give up that texture for a few hundred calories? Choice of chicken or beef and topped by large dollops of guacamole and sour cream, pure caloric heaven!   

Aside from the luncheon menu the remainder can be ordered all day. Being a great place to start, the Mary Lou ($8.75), may sound like a retired Olympic gymnast, is actually red or green chile with meat, folded into a humongous cheese crisp served with a cruet full of sour cream. The red chile has a certain creaminess that's further contrasted with thick tender cubes of beef and a spoonful of sour cream, so easy to swallow. Piñata Appetizers ($12.50) comes on a large dinner plate literally filled with miniature tacos, chimichangas, flautas, green corn tamale and a bowl of refried beans for dipping. This is the mother lode of appetizers, easily feeding 2-4 diners or for a larger appetite ordered as a main course. Being able to try so many different items at one time make this the dim sum of Mexican food.

As you can tell the portion sizes at La Piñata are extremely generous. The Tio Pancho's Pollo Con Queso ($11.95) is an entree force to be reckoned with. A deep fried burro stuffed with tender seasoned chicken and smothered in melted jalapeno cream cheese and cheddar cheese. Easily mesmerized by its girth, one bite and you'll know why you ordered it, simply fantastic. The Yucatan ($11.95) is similar in its approach though this time you're given the choice of meats chicken or beef. Once again smothered, this time in their spinach con queso sauce that combines cheese and spinach into each cheesy melty bite, napkins required.

There are also 10 combination plates for the diner who enjoys variety. The number 2 ($10.95) comes with 2 red or green cheese enchiladas with rice and beans. Again the enchiladas here are simply top drawer. Refried beans are generally the norm, but there is nothing normal about how good these taste. These refried beans could easily make up a meal on their own with a bowl of chips and salsa. Or you can wrap your fist around a Bean Burrito ($4.25) and savor each creamy smooth mouthful.

With so much savory and spicy it's nice to know that there are desserts to refresh your palate. The house made Flan ($4.25) is a great way to finish your meal. It isn't possible but the caramel sauce served with the flan would make an excellent dessert soup. Lightly syrupy with a rich buttery taste, if they do start serving bowl of it, you read it first here! Sopapilla with Honey ($2.95) is always a sticky and sweet pleaser. Lightly fried and delicately crisp on the outside, steamy chewiness on the inside all slathered with thick ropes of golden honey, it isn't just dessert but a simple pleasure.

We are blessed to have one another in our busy day to day lives. So it's nice to know that there are such welcoming places, like La Piñata, where we can tear tortillas, eat homemade beans and just enjoy and celebrate."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"Back in the day, resorts and hotels were some of the best culinary destinations around. The Fairmont Scottsdale, formerly known as the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, was one of those shining examples of upscale greatness with its Marquesa and La Hacienda restaurants. With new owners came new ideas, and both establishments were shuttered to make way for culinary concepts, including the fantastic Bourbon Steak by Chef Michael Mina. 

Now, with the help of chef Richard Sandoval, La Hacienda is re-opening with an updated look and menu.

Sandoval grew up in Mexico City working with his restaurateur father. His upbringing helped to fuel a passion that led to multiple accolades and a reputation for innovative Latin cuisine. He opened his own restaurant in 1997 and over the years he's opened several more star-awarded restaurants.

La Hacienda has always been known for great margaritas. The traditional La Hacienda ($10) is still the tops, but one of the new comers, the El Pina Diablo ($11) uses pineapple and serrano chile infused tequila and is refreshing and subtly spicy. 

In the bar, the daily happy hour runs from 5 to 7 p.m. and features $5 margaritas and snacks ranging from guacamole to tacos.

The dinner menu has been designed to combine ""the bold taste of classic Mexican cuisine with timeless European cooking techniques."" Starting at the top, you can't go wrong with crunchy Chips and Guacamole ($9.50). The appetizer was fresh and delicious, thanks in part to the tableside preparation of the guacamole. Diners can request their preferred level of spiciness while severs prepare the guacamole.

The Queso Fundido ($9) is served in a searing hot cast iron skillet for good reason -- to keep that cheese molten. A winning combination of melted Oaxaca, Chihuahua and Monterrey cheeses, with chorizo or mushrooms atop, fills the soft house-made flour tortillas perfectly.

Ceviche is one of those dishes that can be disastrous or outstanding, Sandoval and Hamrick served up the latter. The Ceviche Tasting ($10) offers two selections tender rock shrimp with avocado accented with chile habanero or mahi mahi, bathed in a citrus tomato broth, and hinted with just enough chile serrano for another layer of flavor. Both were outstanding, especially when tasted with the accompanied bowl of house-made corn nuts. It's a great texture!

Ever heard of huitlacoche? Also known as corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on corn and is considered a delicacy in Mexico. Call it whatever you like, it's delicious earthen taste shouldn't be missed when eating the Tamal de Huitalcoche ($9). A tamal is the same as tamale, though in this case the masa has been infused with the complex flavors of the huitalcoche, filled with goat cheese and zucchini and drizzled with truffle oil. I felt like a Mayan king eating this.

After trying the Chipotle BBQ Chicken Salad ($12), I felt confused. With so many original dishes, why bother with a salad like this? While the ingredients were top notch and it tasted fine, the ordinariness left me scratching my head. 

Making up for this was the Quesadilla ($9), which might sound typical, but after one bite that idea was dispelled. With various fillings, these crispy-on-the-outside, dreamy-on-the-inside quesadillas made for great dipping into the red and green salsas. Fantástico!

Huachinango a la Veracruzana ($26) is a traditional Veracruz style red snapper dish. This gorgeous piece of fish gets a spin with the smoked bacon fufu. A mash of plantains had just enough sweet to balance out the acidic flavor of the tomato, olive and caper sauce.

My favorite entrée, and an instant classic, was the Costilla de Res ($27). The melt-in-your-mouth beef short rib was not only braised, but received a second flavor enhancing method in a smoker. The generous serving of meaty richness was countered by a creamy potato puree and chile habanero and guava sauces.

Desserts are surprisingly light yet still satisfyingly delicious. The Flan de Coco ($9) was perfectly luscious and silky. By contrast, the Churros ($9) had a delightful crunch with a sponge-like interior that absorbed the three different dipping sauces perfectly. La Hacienda also offers house-made ice cream ($8) that includes an avocado version that so good, you might ask for another scoop.

After dessert, coffee is spectacular. The server wheeled out a cart and became not only a mixologist but a pyrotechnician. The columns of burning cinnamon are so beautiful and leave a wonderfully smoky cinnamon smell lingering. These chocolaty rich coffee libations might be a little over the top and full of liquor, but they really shouldn't be missed.

If you have a little too much to drink at La Hacienda you are at one of Scottsdale's finest resorts. Perhaps you can book a night in one of their romantic rooms and make it a mini staycation.

The team at La Hacienda has done a great job paying close attention to the past, but they've set in motion an evolution for a bright and tasty future."
p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag,"I have a simple life, big and small, soft and crispy, full of obvious contradictions and some surprising incarnations. The life of a tortilla is much like anyone else full of glamour, large family drama and constant transformation. I'd like to share that story with you here today, my life as a tortilla.

Ever since being a young kernel of corn I've know I was different from the rest of the ear. While the other kernels longed to be cereal and ethanol, I knew that I wanted to be a star. Celebrated each and every day, giving promise of a brighter and tastier future. Then it happened, I was suddenly plucked, mashed, rolled and pressed, being transformed from the ugly duckling into the beautiful swan I always knew I was. Destined for greatness in the kitchen of Mi Patio, I knew it was all coming true for I am the corn tortilla.

From the second you walk in the door of my home, you can sense my presence. Bold colors, comfortable seating and smiling faces were all there to celebrate my life and times. As soon as you are seated a hot, lightly salty and crispy bowl of me is sat onto the table. They've cut me into triangles so I'm easier to handle, then I'm deep-fried golden and simply beautiful. My 2 friends, Mild and Spicy, are a couple of salsas that love to hang out all over me. Go ahead, grab me and dip me deep into one of them, slather me in their tomato goodness, I deserve it as much as you do. I have another friend, the cold and refreshing Margarita ($1.75), who simply completes me. Enjoy them slowly while the wandering minstrels play requests from my motherland of Mexico, this would bring a joyful tear to me eye, if I had one.

On the menu you can find many of my brothers, sisters and cousins. My cousin Quesapilla ($6.35) is a real show off though his beginnings are quite humble. Some also call him native fry bread but I just call him a crowd pleasure. Stuffed with gobs of cheese and griddled until melted and bubbly, he tastes just as good as he looks. Spoon on some fresh pico de gallo and you'll see why the ladies swoon and the men groom. My sister from another mother, Quesadilla ($5.95) is a total sweetheart. She's wide, thin and crispy all covered with cheese and I mean that in the nicest possible way. She, Mild and Spicy have a triad relationship, all complementing one another in each melted bite.

Baja Chicken Burro ($8.35) is one of my favorite uncles. He's the uncle who shows up delicious and golden brown, draped in an outrageous creamy coat of sour cream and cilantro, Id have to say he is all about glamour and fashion. Much like season 1 of Project Runway where Jay McCarroll and Wendy Pepper would cat fight every single week, my uncle Baja simply does not get along with auntie Huevos Rancheros ($8.35), a snide but delicious bitch. Her fluffy eggs are perfectly cooked, her delicious Ranchero sauce and her rice and beans make for a satisfying anytime platter.

Not liking to sound like a total me-me, I do have to say that I taste pretty good wrapped around Carne Asada con Pico de Gallo ($11.75). Tender steak grilled to a nice medium and served with pico de gallo, rice and beans. All you have to do is fill me up with some of your juicy meat and it's a win-win scenario. I get to soak up your meat juice and you get to eat all 6"" of my round deliciousness.

Every family has a black sheep and mine is no exception. Coming from a Greek father and a Mexican mother, Gyros Chimi ($8.50), is one of mystery and excitement. Inside she is full of tender slices of roasted gyro meat, gently deep fried then she's covered in the perfect accessory, creamy cucumber sauce. To add to her difference she is served with a hearty baked zucchini complete with sliced onion and a rich tomato sauce. You'll have no idea what you're getting yourself into until you take your first bite, delish.

Unlike auntie Huevos, the Chorizo and Egg Burro ($6.55), is tasty and uncomplicated. Any chance I get to soak in sauce I'm so there! Try the #106 Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada, Rice & Beans ($8.55) for a celebration of soak. Stuffed with cheese then covered in a slightly sweet and spicy sauce I taste real good if I can say so myself. I also enjoy being bent over, deep-fried then filled with beef and topped with lettuce and tomatoes. One bite into my crunchy exterior exposes my goods for you to enjoy completely.

I'm a firm believer that a meal is never complete without something sugary, it doesn't have to be too big. Fry bread with Cinnamon & Honey ($3.25) is sticky and sweet cousin of mine, who I like to call Fannie. Like my other cousin Quesapilla, she's golden brown, chewy and drizzled with honey and a sprinkle of cinnamon. After tasting Fannie, you might wonder why you've never given her a taste before?

Now that I've been able to share so much of myself with you here today, I feel a great peace and inner joy that can only be brought out by my loyal fans. In whatever form I take from a taco to a warm steamy basket know this, I am here for u."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"This is an update to the review I posted over a year ago, and I'm sorry to say that this has to be - by far - the worst meal we've had in the 10 years we've been in Vegas.

Last time we ordered combos, and that seems to have made the difference.  This time, not so hungry after snacking at an earlier function, we decided to go the individual dish route.

The same 13 choices are on the menu.  Except for one lamb, one fish (which I'd be afraid to try here) and a vegetable combo, the rest are beef, beef, and more beef.  The veggie might have been an option, but not after two of them were listed as collard greens and cabbage.  Not exciting at all.  

I wanted a glass of honey wine, which I had tasted a few years earlier at a different Ethiopian restaurant.  It's a strange wine, but I've got strange tastes.  Almost verbatim, the owner repeated the same line as last time, about the wine coming from L.A. and they didn't get the shipment.  Coincidence?  Maybe.  But I don't think so.  He didn't suggest anything else, and I didn't ask.  I was already feeling the downer vibe, and stuck with water.

I started to order the dry-sauteed beef, but he said it might be a little dry and chewy, so we switched to two others.  They seemed to be variations of the same dish.  One had some tomatoes added to the jalapeños and onions,  and was in tiny pieces.  The other had longer strips that were way too long to eat comfortably, and also had the jalapeños and onion, but no tomatoes.  Both dishes were poured into a large tray lined with the injera bread, and the tray had a tiny serving of salad - two tablespoons if I'm being generous - for each of us.

The small beef dice had no flavor whatsoever.  The long strips had a little more flavor, though not much.  Both were improved by the vinegar in the injera. But they were both tough as nails.  When the owner came over to ask how things were going, I told him that the beef was tough.  He paused a couple of seconds, said ""Okay,"" and walked away.  The salad didn't taste fresh and had some brown pieces.

The only other customers were a table of four with a baby who didn't stop shrieking the whole time.  But they provided some much-needed entertainment:  the kid sat on the mother's lap and kept yanking at the strings of beads that were the front window curtain.  Each time she pulled, the rod arced downward, and the mom never attempted to stop her.  This being Vegas, I made book with Herb about how long it would take before the whole curtain came crashing down.  Neither of us won, because thankfully they left halfway through our meal.  Then the music was cranked up a little.  I love Arabic music with a beat, 'cause I can belly dance in my seat.  But this stuff was some awful male singer wailing, and it was unbearable.

The only thing good that I can say is that at least it's cheap.  Each of our beef dishes was 9.99.  But since it comes only with the anemic little bit of salad, and the beef obviously wasn't filet mignon, it wasn't worth even that much.  I can't even say ""stick with the chicken,"" because there was none."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"I love this hotel for the elegant excitement it exudes (how's that for alliteration?).  I haven't stayed here yet, but maybe one of these days they'll give us a comp.  Hope springs eternal...

Tonight we attended our second Identity Series cardholders' free event.  This was a ""tasting"" at the Wicked Spoon, their buffet.  Private room, all you can drink of the two specialty drinks that were available:  one was an apple and vodka concoction, and the other was a ginger beer and vodka.  Both were terrific, and I didn't get the name of either drink.  But before I could even get to Drink #2, I no longer cared  :D

The food was buffet-style, and tonight's offering was Polish Cuisine (as in Poland - you didn't have to shine anything).  They had the a dish akin to stuffed cabbage, only the little meatballs were mixed with shredded cabbage, rather than stuffed into cabbage leaves.  I'll have to remember this - it's much less work to prepare!  It was delicious.  There were also fresh green beans that had a major kick; beautiful yellow beets and purple cauliflower that were pickled, but much too tangy for my taste.  And there was also hot borscht, served in little glasses with or without sour cream.

Waiters passed trays of breaded pork filet ""fingers"" that were outstanding, and superb pirogies.

The desserts were to die for - upscale pastries and mousses that for once tasted as good as they looked, and white or dark chocolate-covered marshmallow lollipops.  

My group of seven was lucky to snare one of the four round banquettes that were available.  Others had to stand at tables, and this event, which was supposed to be two hours long, actually lasted quite a bit longer.

This was a fantastic event,  and FREE!!! - and if Cosmopolitan continues to offer this kind of perk to cardholders, it will be a death knell to other casinos.  

The ambience throughout the hotel is phenomenal.  My major quibble is that the casino does not have enough machines to pique the interest of us low-rollers.  Too many of the penny machines have outrageously high minimum bids, and they just turn me off.  If I wanted to blow $3 and up for each pull, I'd play dollar machines.  But I don't.  So I don't gamble any more money at Cosmopolitan, I just spend less time there.

I have to give big kudos to George, one of the security staff.  When I first got to the hotel tonight I sat down at a slot machine to search my purse for my Identity Card.  I couldn't find it easily, so I pulled everything out.  Midway through the Wicked Spoon event, I realized my iPhone was gone, and took the long hike back to that slot machine.  The machine was right next to an escalator which, because it wasn't working, had George in front of it directing people.  He was still there when I went back and, praise whatever deity you worship, he had my phone!!!  Of course, the major thank you has to go to the honest person who turned it in to him, but that identity will never be known.  

The phone caper was the icing on the cake for an evening that was perfectly executed and beyond classy.  I love this hotel!!!"
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"I had dinner at Spiedini once before, when I first moved to Vegas, when Yelp didn't even have a foothold.  At that time, it had been suggested by our real estate agent, who joined us for dinner.  My recollection was of a dimly-lit, sorta romantic upscale place, with high prices to go along with it.  Fast forward 10 years, and what a difference a decade makes.  

We were warmly greeted at the entrance and immediately shown to a table.  The first thing that struck me was how bright the restaurant is:  every pendant, recessed, and accent light at full blast, making it seem like the good old days at Senior's restaurant in Brooklyn, aptly named for its clientele.  Where was the mood lighting of my memory?  Gone, gone, gone.

Service was excellent throughout our dinner.  I was happy to see a good German Riesling on the menu, rather than the ubiquitous Chateau Ste. Michelle that's on every other restaurant's list.  Two kinds of decent bread were in the basket, promptly delivered along with olive oil/balsamic.  

Hubby started with gazpacho.  It had a good taste, though it was missing the usual garnish of chopped veggies.  It did, though, have a bit of avocado.  But in my book, gazpacho needs to be served very cold, even on ice, and this one wasn't quite cold enough.  

I ordered from the list of specials, a pork tenderloin w/ prosciutto, served with sauteed spinach and garlic mashed.  The pork was sliced paper-thin, but wasn't dried out.  It was covered with a tasty brown sauce chock full of fresh dark mushroom quarters.  Normally I'm not a fan of sauces, but I liked this one.  The fresh spinach was full of garlic slices (yum!), but the mashed potatoes were shockingly bad:  thin, watery, flavorless, and tasting as if they'd come out of a box (a dollar store box at that).  I asked for a replacement, and cheerfully was served a large portion of the roasted potatoes, and those were very good.  There was plenty of pork, and those potatoes, so I have enough for another meal.

My husband had the meatballs and spaghetti.  He thought they were okay, but wasn't smacking his lips.  I tasted the meatballs and didn't like them, but I detest meatballs made with pork, which this seemed to have.  And it's rare for me to like a meatball that doesn't taste like the ones my mom used to make, even though her cooking in general left much to be desired. (Well-done liver, anyone?).  I didn't try his spaghetti, so I can't speak to it's ""toothsome-ness,"" but it wasn't a very large portion.

The prices, while not low, aren't as relatively high as they were 10 years ago.  My entree, at $20, was a much better value than Herb's, which was $19.  In a contrarian move, this restaurant seems to buck the tide of all the others:  many of the specials are the same price or lower than the ones on the regular menu.  That's almost unheard of these days.

I've been seesawing between 3 and 4 stars, but downgraded it to 3 because of the lighting, the awful mashed potatoes, and the stingy portion of balls and pasta.  I enjoyed my dinner, and three stars means A-OK so I'll stick with that for now."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"I've been to Happy Hour at Crave a few times, but I'm updating my review because this is the first time we've had dinner there.  

We settled in to a comfortable booth, but I had to keep my jacket on the whole time, because it was very cold.  I ordered the house chardonnay.  I never order chardonnay unless I'm forced to.  And it's only recently, with my newfound ability to tolerate it, that it hasn't had me worshiping the porcelain god after just one glass.  It was chardonnay or bust, since I had no intention of paying $11 for a Washington State Riesling that was probably going to be dryer than a... Okay, I'm not going to finish that sentence the way I want to.  The Yelp gods wouldn't like it.  There was a white sangria, but it, too, was $11.  At most other restaurants, sangria is what you order if you're on a strict budget.  Can I afford it?  Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm going to do it.  

So on to the main event.  Hubby ordered Pad Thai, with chicken.  (It's always chicken.  He even clucks in his sleep). Adding that chicken made it nearly 40% more expensive than your typical Thai restaurant, but it was 40% not as good.  The dish was not a large portion and the chicken, what little there was of it, was as dry as that Riesling would have been.    

My dish was the Grilled Salmon salad.  I asked for romaine instead of the spring mix, and it also included spinach, onion, couscous, feta and spiced pecans.  The salmon, which I ordered medium, was a rather small piece, and was cooked medium on half of it, and well done on the other.  When I flipped it over, I saw why:  it was burned on the well-done half.  The romaine was chopped into little pieces.  I know a lot of people like chopped salad, but I'm not one of them.  The pearl couscous was tasteless, the pecans almost non-existent, same as the feta and spinach.  The dressing, which I had on the side, was supposed to be a cranberry vinaigrette, but was a thick and gloppy mixture of unidentifiable ancestry.  No taste of cranberry, or any other fruit, anywhere.  I could have sent my salmon back, but it would have been the same woeful dish, only with (maybe) less incinerated salmon.  There was nothing else I wanted to order, it was late, and I didn't want to wait.

But what really pushed my buttons is that this poor excuse of a salad cried out for bread, both to fill me up and to act as a pusher for those tiny bits of lettuce.  Apparently, that's a dirty word here.  Our waitperson said that many people ask for it and they, too, have conveyed that to the management, but it falls on deaf ears.  I couldn't get it and, knowing that they have it for sandwiches, made me even more pissed off.  I guess the motto here is ""Let them eat cake.""  I bumped it up one star because at least the service was good.

It's really a shame that this place, with its upscale and beautiful decor, can't produce a decent meal, at least in our case.  And the stinginess of the ingredients, as well as the unwillingness to satisfy a simple request for something that should be provided at the very least with a salad, leads us to say ""¡No más!"
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"P.J. Clarke's opened tonight in the Forum Shops at Caesar's.  Our regular Friday Night gang met there last night for the last of their ""soft openings.""  In the interest of full disclosure, our dinner was comped, and was mostly limited to the evening's featured ""softie"" - burgers.  I say mostly, because when we got there, late, victims of the traffic that engulfed the Strip due to the influx of CES tourists, our friends were already gorging on a plate of raw oysters, and that wasn't on the list we were given.   We, too, were coming from the Convention center, and it took us 45 minutes to get to Caesar's, then another 10 to get the car valet'd, since that, too, was full.

Hubster and I don't eat oysters, so our friends managed to convince them to bring us shrimp.  And gawd, those were the biggest damned shrimp I've ever seen.  They were terrific.

The real freebie consisted of wine or beer, burgers, fries, and salad.  We're white wine drinkers, and there was no Riesling, just Chardonnay and Pino Grigio.  The Pino was super dry, so I had some Merlot.  The salad was one big disappointment, just a pile of ugly greens with a few thin slices of the tiniest baby radish I ever could imagine.  Your eight bucks won't get you anything else, not even a crouton.

The burgers were great - fresh, meaty, not oversalted - but the buns were just ordinary.  I ordered mine with Vermont cheddar, sauteed onions, and mushrooms.  Toppings are $1.20 each, so that brought the burger close to $14, which I guess is par for the Strip, which is why we stick mostly local.  I also ordered a cup of coffee, and it was cold.

What really drowned this place for us, though, was the water, pun intended.  The waiter asked whether we all wanted water.  I said ""no,"" but got it anyway.  It was served in small glasses slightly larger than juice glasses, with no logo.  There was no brand to approve, no cork to sniff, no swirling nor sniffing.  Yet when we got the pretend bill, we noticed that THEY CHARGED FOR THE WATER!!!  What the hell are they thinking???  Has Lake Mead become a designer label??  And that, dear reader, is my death knell for this restaurant.

The service was spotty.  The place wasn't more than one-third full, yet our waiter had some trouble keeping up and getting things right.  Service picked up tremendously when Marty, who said he was a busser, joined the team.  A young and earnest full-time Type A, he went over and above to see that we were satisfied.  He was definitely worth the price of admission.

P.J. Clarke's is a venerable New York institution, in business since 1884, and that's no typo.  They're suddenly pushing to go national - they have a branch in Chicago, one that just opened in D.C., and now, Vegas.  I tried to check the website to see what the full menu is like, but the links on the Vegas page aren't working, at least on Firefox and Chrome.  (I don't go near IE).  IMHO, this is symbolic of the lengths they'll need to travel to distinguish themselves from all the competition in this town.  And if they persist in charging for tap water, it's going to be a long road to travel."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"It pains me greatly to have to downgrade my review from five stars to two, but our Thanksgiving dinner was one turkey leg short of disaster.

A friend planned to join us and wanted a perfect sit-down dinner with atmosphere. Americana definitely has the ambience, so after looking at their Thanksgiving menu online, my husband called to make a reservation a couple of days before the holiday. They asked if there was any special occasion, and he said no. Then he remembered that it's the actual date of our anniversary (!), and called early Thanksgiving day and told them. That's when they said they had no reservation for us (WTF!), but would squeeze us in. We should have said ""never mind.""

We weren't on the patio or next to the window, and it was too brightly lit to be able to see the lake. Once seated, they provided us with a ""special"" wine list that had only bottles. I asked if there was wine available by the glass, and I was brought a pricey list. Two glasses added nearly $25 to the bill.

For our appetizer, we chose the butternut squash bisque instead of the salad. Last time we had it, it was beyond fabulous. This time it totally lacked flavor.

We all decided on the traditional turkey dinner, but what we were served was anything but traditional. I asked for mine with gravy on the side, but all three plates came out exactly the same: Slop, and more slop. Small pieces of dark meat turkey, with skin and fat, mixed in with a few veggies, some stuffing, a dollop of watery, over-pureed sweet potatoes or yams, all sitting in a pool of liquid. It looked disgusting, and tasted even worse. The stuffing had some seasoning that burned our mouths - not the kind of good spicy, but more like someone dumped half a bottle of oregano, or something like that, into the mixture.

After we complained, we were served a regular platter of white meat turkey, along with the veggies (in short supply), and the same yams and stuffing as before.  Our friend, who had a different vantage point, noticed that a table across from her had the white meat plate, too.  Had they complained also? And what's Thanksgiving dinner without cranberry sauce? It was on the menu, but wasn't served until we asked for it. And sauce it was: not jellied, not cranberries, just a cranberry-colored soup that helped us down the rather tasteless turkey. (Note: we doused the leftovers with a real, delicious, whole cranberry sauce from Smith's supermarket). 

During the meal they delivered deep-fried turkey legs to all the diners, and those were good. For dessert, we chose the peanut butter bar.  It was Thanksgiving, so we gave thanks that at least that item was the same as we remembered it, except that it was decorated with oat flakes, instead of the strawberries or raspberries of memory.

Finally, why ask if there's a special occasion being celebrated, if absolutely nothing is said or done to commemorate that occasion? So much for our anniversary.

For those who think this is a five-star restaurant, go on a holiday and see for yourself how they can't handle a crowd.  As for us, we're done, in more ways than simply ending this review."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"Lazy Dog was crowded, but we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table at around 8:30 p.m., and it's Saturday night.  That's because it's a big place, and offers a variety of seating in the restaurant, bar, and also the patio, where (wo)man's best friend can join you for dinner.  

The only canines with us tonight were in our mouths, and they wanted to do their work.  But first, the drinks.  I was thrilled to see that Lazy Dog hasn't copied every other chain restaurant.  They actually have the drink prices printed on their menus!!!  Having been burned more than a few times, we always ask, and we didn't have to endure the waitress saying ""I THINK the price is...,"" or have a server run back to the bar repeatedly to ask the bartenders.  I deplore this practice, so it was refreshing.  And so was the Peach Bellini I ordered, which was served in a tall, skinny glass with the peach puree , and a fresh individual 187 ml bottle of Freixenet Cava on the side. The draft beer list is extensive, and the prices are reasonable - my Bellini was 7.25, and I could have had a margarita for less, and his draft Tenaya Creek was 4.00 for 16 oz.

My husband ordered the Chicken Pot Pie, and I decided on the Chicken with veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  We also ordered a side salad, and our waitress properly asked if we wanted it before or with our meals.  We wanted it before, to share a little nibble before the main event. The one downfall in the service is that it never appeared, but the runner came out with our entrees.  Rather than have the food taken back to get cold, we cancelled the salad.

The hubster loved his pot pie.  I wasn't all that crazy about my pasta dish:  it was bland, the eggplant cubes were undercooked, and it was way too salty.  Though I have no trouble sending back a dish that isn't prepared properly, I was going to just stick with it.  But suddenly, unbidden, a young woman appeared, introduced herself as Lorena, a manager, and asked how my food was.  Not my husband's, just mine.  I told her all about it, but said I was going to keep it, even after she offered to get me something else.  Turns out that she's not a manager at this branch; she's from corporate, and is charged with getting this new restaurant up and running.  It's their first location outside of California, and they want to get it right before their next venture into Texas.  She said that they'd had a number of complaints about my entree, namely all of the things I found wrong with it.  She stated that she was already taking it off the check, and insisted I get another entree, even if I had it boxed up to take home, which she also was going to comp.  How could I resist!!

Act II was the Walnut Chicken Salad Sandwich, on the brioche roll instead of the multigrain bread, at Lorena's suggestion.  All the stuff I love:  walnuts, curry mayo, cranberries, and more.  It was delish!!  But more important, that experience was Service, with a capital S.

We both really love Lazy Dog, and their very big menu - plus a nice Happy Hour menu - and with the location pretty close to home, we'll be back again and again."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"Our first visit to Marche Bacchus was to celebrate my birthday, so we went this past Saturday night.  My husband had gone there a week earlier to make the reservation, to be sure of getting a table by the lake.  The reservation was for 7:30, but I was running late, as usual.  He called and asked if we could change it for 8:00.  ""Sure, just don't be late.""

We were five minutes early.  The hostess informed us that it would be ""just a few minutes.""  So we waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  After about 20 minutes, and being told it would be ""very soon,"" we were offered a really crummy table. We declined. Jeff, the owner - who's now famous after being on Pawn Stars as the ""wine expert"" -  helped us choose what turned out to be the perfect bottle of Riesling, and it sat on a table inside, waiting along with us, getting as warm as we were getting hot under the collar.

Wendy, Jeff's wife, was very friendly and solicitous.  She said she had the perfect table picked out for us, but the foursome, who had long finished eating, drinking, and paying their bill, just wouldn't leave.  She didn't want to be rude and incur their wrath and ask them to leave.  Wendy did offer us a glass of champagne while we waited, but we turned it down, since we'd be drinking that bottle of wine.  And so we continued to wait.  After very nearly an hour, and after I'd told Wendy that my patience was wearing thin and that my birthday celebration was being ruined, she got the brilliant idea to offer THEM a glass of champagne at the bar if they'd relinquish their table.  They got up immediately, and I never did find out if they had that drink.

The table was great - spacious, since we were two at a table for four - and right next to the lake.  This was the dimmer part of the patio, which suited us fine - we thought the upper part was too brightly lit.  But of course I couldn't see the ducks very well.  Oh well, I wasn't planning to have duck, anyway.

Our server, Jason (I think), was perfectly competent, though not overly friendly.  We ordered the warm spinach salad, and he had the kitchen split it for us.  It was super, but turned out not really big enough to share.

I had the trout, and it ranked up there with some of the best I've ever had.  Sometimes filet of trout has bones, and this baby had not a single one.  It was topped with a balsamic drizzle, some crabmeat, and a few leaves of fresh spinach.  It was a good-sized portion, and the half I took home tasted as delicious the next night.

My husband had the petite filet mignon.  He liked it, but when I tasted it I thought it could have been more tender.  I also found the pomme frites perfectly ordinary, just a notch above Mickey D's.

What really irked me was that after our long, long wait, I thought we should have been comped a dessert, only because Wendy knew it was my birthday and that it was close to being ruined.  That little touch would have left me with a much better feeling about Marche Bacchus.  I'm still giving it four stars - and wouldn't have raised it to five just for a free dessert - but the taste in my mouth would have been so much sweeter."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"If anyone had told me that I, a Jewish girl from Brooklyn and former hippie, would be living in Vegas and watchin a '30s-'40's swing show in the Italian-American Social Club, I'd think they'd just arrived on the first flight from Mars.  There's just no end to the Secrets of Sin City!

How'd we get there?  An offering from LV House Seats.  It was definitely not my speed, but the description was intriguing.  And, they serve dinner (optional), so we figured we could kill two birds with one bocce ball.

Aside from the fact that the average age of the audience was the wrong side of 75 (the saxophone player is 96 - and I am, to plagiarize Dave Barry, NOT making this up), the show was delightful. The reason for the offer was because the second part of the show was being taped for TV and will be seen on some local cable station - which one escapes me - in a few weeks.

Jeanne Brei was the singer and star of the show, which runs the first Thursday of every month.   She's a pro - a woman of a certain age with a great voice and more energy than a 10-year-old.  The band is incredibly talented and date back to the very beginning of Vegas history - the sax player played with Benny Goodman, and all the other ""youngsters"" probably have a combined 200 years of experience.  She and the band are known as the Speakeasy Swingers.  Though listening to music such as ""Pennies from Heaven"" is definitely not my cup of Chianti, the show was very enjoyable.  

There's also a large dance floor, populated mostly with a few professional dancers, but some regular couples got up to dance, too, though not the 95-year-old woman in the wheelchair who used to do solo flying.  The second part of the show, the one that'll be shown on TV, featured Jeanne, a talented tap dance duo, and solos by a couple of very good singers.

But this is Yelp, so now to the food.  It was mostly terrific.  And no surprise - Italian!  I ordered Chicken Marsala.  I couldn't see the chicken, because it was buried under more mushrooms than I've ever seen on this dish - dark, woodsy, mushrooms in an authentic and rich Marsala sauce.  The same sauce, with even more mushrooms, covered the perfectly-cooked linguine served alongside it.  Hubby had Chicken Piccata, and it, too, was different - it was garnished with beautiful THINGS:  were they uncured olives? capers on steroids?  They're not my thing, so I couldn't tell, but my husband sure loved them.  Both entrees came with a small, unremarkable dinner salad in an unfortunate styrofoam bowl, and the bread, which should have been as wonderful as the food, was awful.  

I think there's no cover for the show, and the fact that it was offered on LV House Seats was merely to ensure an audience for the taped portion.  Sometime during the evening a gentleman walked around with a basket collecting contributions ""for the band.""

The large room is, no surprise, very dated - probably dates back to the Bugsy era, and there's a full bar in a completely separate room, with a juke box.

This is surely worth a trip - for the entertainment, the food, and the nostalgia of a bygone era.  And you can even go for free Salsa lessons on the other Thursdays!!"
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"This review should have been written a long time ago.  What jogged my memory was that I just read two reviews for Dr. Stephen Kurtz at his other office. I was so incensed by the subhuman treatment those people received that I realized I had never written my own.  But better late than never, if only to warn people to stay away.  In one of those other reviews, the guy actually saw Dr. Kurtz at this Smoke Ranch office, but must have had trouble finding this location on Yelp.  I know I did.

Some background is necessary:  When we first moved to Vegas, we casually asked a medical specialist where we should go if either of us ever needed surgery in the future.  We were expecting him to give us the name of his preferred hospital.  But, in what turned out to be a common (non-) joke, he said ""McCarran.""

So when I needed surgery a couple of years ago, I took his advice.  Coming from a doctor, I figured it had more weight.  I was also now more aware of the woefully embarrassing ratings of hospitals in this city.  I found a well-regarded surgeon at Cedars-Sinai in L.A., but I wasn't happy with my decision.  That's because it was one trip for the initial appointment, another for an in-office battery of pre-surgical tests, a third for the surgery, and a fourth for a post-surgery follow-up.  There would have been another a week after the surgery, but we managed to get the doctor to work with us to avoid that.  It was harrowing, since we drove each time, but finally, it was over.  Or so I thought.

I started having problems with the procedure, so I tried to find a local doctor.  My research told me that I was going to need surgery to repair the repair, and I sure didn't want to go the L.A. route again.  My husband had used Dr. Kurtz, though for very different reasons, so I called the office to find out if Dr. Kurtz had experience with my problem.  I scheduled an appointment.

This doctor is aptly named.  He was exceedingly curt.  He examined me, then told me to go back to the doctor in L.A.  I then called the doctor in L.A., who is very pleasant and accommodating.  He told me that he and Dr. Kurtz are friends, and that he would be happy to intercede.  He told me to have Dr. Kurtz call him.  He also sent him a text message, which was never answered.

I conveyed that information to the front desk, and waited.  And waited some more.  I gave them my request again, and asked that Dr. Kurtz call me.  No call came.  Finally, I called again and asked directly if Dr. Kurtz was going to speak to me.  The answer was a resounding NO, along with ""Dr. Kurtz will not see you anymore.""  What gall to not even have the common decency to get on the phone and tell me himself!

The guy who wrote the review for Kurtz at the other office stated that Kurtz wrote on his file that the patient was not to be seen for ""any doctor in the practice.""  All that patient did was show up late for an appointment, after the doctor had left, but had called the office to tell them he was going to be late.  While there are two sides to every story, my own experience makes me believe that it happened exactly as he told it.  This ego-inflated doctor is a disgrace to the profession."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"The other afternoon I turned the wrong direction onto Cheyenne and caught a glimpse of a new restaurant in the space that used to be Gallo's.  I went inside and saw a lot of the familiar decor, but with a fresh new look.  White tablecloths, though plastic, were the fancy kind, and flowers on the table created a whole new atmosphere.  I looked at the menu, liked what I saw, and returned for dinner tonight.  We were a group of eight.

I didn't look at bottle prices for the wine, but some of the per-glass prices were a bit steep.  My husband and I ordered Riesling, which was the least expensive, but that's not why we ordered it.  We just prefer it.  But the brand listed was Chateau Ste. Michelle, which is our least favorite.  When it was served, we were astounded that they would substitute a different brand and not tell us - this wine was delicious!  We soon learned from the owner, who brought over the bottle, that THIS Ste. Michelle was a completely different vintage from the cheaper stuff every other bar and restaurant serves!  

Half the couples ordered beef tacos as an appetizer.  The beef is served in a small crispy tortilla bowl, and the fixings, including guacamole, surround it.  I had a taste and it was delicious.  For me, it would have been a meal.  But they're bigger eaters.

Three people ordered the rib steak and pronounced it terrific.  It was served with brown rice and a mixture of fresh asparagus, green beans, and julienned carrots, as were all the other entrees.  I'm not a fan of brown rice, but there was nothing to substitute for it, so I got it anyway.  It was more like a risotto, which I'm usually not crazy about, but in this case it was a definite improvement over the usually bland brown rice.

My husband ordered blackened tuna, and another friend had blackened salmon.  Both were perfectly prepared, though she complained about the salt, which is why I never order blackened anything - virtually all brands of that seasoning have salt as their first ingredient.  I tasted both, and the fish was astoundingly good (if you discount the seasoning).  Another friend had one of the specialty salads as her main, and she raved about it.

My own entree was the only one that was disappointing.  I ordered the Spicy Shrimp in Lime Garlic Sauce.  The shrimp were on the small side, though overall there were enough of them.  I'd rather have fewer, larger shrimp.  But I tasted no lime and no garlic, and it seemed to be in a thin tomato-y sauce that was nothing like what I was expecting.  When I asked the waitress to bring me some lime, she returned with lemon quarters.  Not the same!!!  She checked in the kitchen and returned to tell me that they have no fresh limes - the dish is made with processed lime juice.  The vegetables were excellent, but my brown rice was good halfway through.  Then I got to a hard lump that obviously had sat in the pot too long and was scraped from the side.  It wasn't burned, just hard and dried out.  

Had I not been so disappointed in my own dish (which wasn't terrible, just blah), I would have given this place five stars.  After all, seven out of eight of us loved our entrees.  But we all loved the ambience, the comfort, and an owner who was present throughout.  We will definitely return soon."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"First, a disclaimer: I was here with a group from my neighborhood for the Tuesday Evening Patio Party, so the Happy Hour menu was on the bill.

The setting is magnificent: a very large patio fronting water and mountains. Our group got together at 6:00 p.m., and it was still sunny; I didn't see much refuge from the sun, but happily, it wasn't that hot, and by the time the sun set it was perfect weather.

I was a little peeved that my favorite wines, Riesling and Prosecco, or even a Cava, weren't available. I was obligingly brought a sample of two different Pinot Grigios, but they were too dry for my taste, so in a Sleepless in Seattle moment, I said ""I'll have what she's having,"" meaning my neighbor, who was sipping a vodka and cranberry with a splash of OJ. It turned out to be one of the most awful drinks I've ever had, really peculiar tasting; a waitress said she thought it might be the cranberry they use. I suspect I'm not the first to have sent it back. I ended up with the Pinot, anyway. It was a couple of notches up from that dreadful other one.

I ordered the shrimp salad, but this was no salad. There was an enormous portion of tasty shrimp. Had I known that it was going to be in a full bowl of SOUP, composed of what tasted like mayonnaise and ketchup with an almost imperceptible kick of spice, I would have asked for the dressing on the side. There was no way of getting most of the clingy sauce off any of the shrimp. It was also too much shrimp for one person to eat; between that and the dressing, it's a good thing I'm not having my cholesterol checked tomorrow.

After that, I stood up, and suddenly realized that the entire back of my pants was wet - REALLY wet. It looked as if I had done you-know-what. I looked at the seat, which had definitely been dry when I first sat down, and it, too, had a big, round wet spot dead center. A couple of guys who are regular golfers and diners there, who had come over to talk to one of our group, told me that this sometimes happens, because the seats get wet from the sprinklers, absorb the water, get dry on the outside, then spring a leak after someone sits in them. Lucky me! I didn't dry off during the considerable time we spent after that, even in the desert, and was really uncomfortable and embarrassed. My husband managed to find a cushion for me that had a plasticized exterior. Many of the other fabric ones had lots of bird poop on them.

My husband was still hungry after his chicken ""fingers,"" which were really bigger than any fingers I've ever seen (this is not a political statement), so he got the Margherita flatbread, which another neighbor was eating. It looked a little soft, so he asked for it well-done, which is the way it came out. It was good, though not exceptional.

The waitress (and the rest of the staff) did a fabulous job, especially considering the size of the group, our many requests, and the fact that everyone wanted separate checks, which were cheerfully provided.

Five stars for the ambience, service and the guitarist, who never seemed to take a break and played wonderful music that still allowed us to talk. Two to three stars for the food. One star for the trick fabric cushions. I might consider coming back, but surely not when summer in the desert ratches up."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"For starters, we were quite impressed with the decor, a mixture of traditional and modern.  Great lighting, too. It has a large patio, not quite set up yet, but it was way too hot to eat outside anyway.  

I asked about a wine list, and our waiter, Navi, brought over a single page that had two whites and four reds (along with a few beers).  I'm a white wine drinker, but can't handle either of the two, Chardonnay and Pinot Grigio.  They honestly get me sick.  He offered to go to the nearby liquor store and bring back anything I wanted.  I was going to skip the wine (horrors!), but the owner came out.  He explained that they were set to have a meeting this week with the wine rep, and they were working on setting up a full bar service, including more and different wines and specialty cocktails.  Though I posted a pic of the current list, I'm going to remove it.  I don't think it's fair to keep it, since the restaurant is new and still a work in progress.

The owner, Ritesh, is a highly educated professional who switched to cooking as a second career.  We thoroughly enjoyed talking with him, and his desire to please radiated during our whole meal.  He insisted that Navi go get the wine I wanted, so I acquiesced. I was a happy camper.

The menu is so atypical of the usual Indian restaurant.  It's very small, but everything is cooked fresh.  Ritesh explained that this allows him to focus on the quality of each dish.  He will, though, be adding a few other items, including a thali, which we love to order, since it allows you to sample a variety of food.

We started with samosas, an order of three:  one with peas, another with potato, and the third with paneer and corn.  I don't think I've ever seen corn in an Indian restaurant before.  They were incredibly light, with pastry unlike the usual Chinese eggroll stuff you usually get, and the fillings were delicious, expecially the paneer and corn.  I'm not a pea lover, but loved the dense filling of that one.  The creamy mint and tangy tamarind sauces were yummy.

For our mains we shared a Saag curry bowl, with chicken added, as well as paneer and fresh vegetables.  We ordered both of our dishes medium-spicy, and that's how it was.  Along with that we got Baingan barta, and the smaller size of smoked eggplant dish was a good accompaniment to the large portion of Saag. The garlic naan we ordered was covered with minced FRESH garlic. Last time we had it, at a different place, I couldn't even see or taste garlic.  As it was, I could barely eat much of the main courses after the filling Samosas, but then, I'm not a very big eater.  We'll have my very favorite meal - leftovers - tonight.

As if the great food and phenomenal service weren't enough, a treat awaited us at the end.  Our wonderful waiter was nearby and heard me toast Herb for his birthday.  He said ""Oh, is it your birthday?""  I told him it had actually been two days before.  But when we finished packing up the leftovers, Navi and Ritesh came out with a birthday dessert for us to share - their beautiful Kulfi trio:  mango, pistachio and raspberry, artfully presented on a long rectangular plate.

Even better than the fact that it was a delicious meal, it was a special and memorable experience, and I wish Curry Leaf a long and prosperous life."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"So why have I downgraded my previous review? 

First, the positives:

- The technician, Laurie/Lori (I think), did everything to make me comfortable during my three, count 'em, THREE separate MRIs.
- I was grateful to the facility for allowing me to schedule all three at once.
- They have really late hours.

The main reason for the downgrade is that the guy at the reception desk was sick. Really sick. Like hacking up a lung, maybe two. I heard it throughout the 2+ hours of my visit, even with the door closed in the procedure room, the jackhammer noise from the machine, and the music playing from a radio to block the noise. Sneezing, blowing his nose, but also handing me papers to fill out beforehand. I'm a germophobe in general, but this was beyond the pale.

This is a serious lapse on the part of management, who allowed this man to stay at work. My husband, poor soul, sat in the waiting room the whole time, and had to go over and close the reception window to try and protect himself from all the germs being spewed out into the small room. I returned to Vegas two weeks ago, having caught a fever from my daughter, and ended up in a hospital with pneumonia. I shudder to think that my husband will get sick and I'll get even sicker. 

The other reason is one that others may respectfully disagree with, but it is a turn-off to me. I do not patronize establishments that wear religion on their sleeves, and I won't name any specific ones here. (Just think chicken, arts and crafts, and certain sandwiches). I hadn't noticed it last time, but this time the waiting room contained a copy of the Holy Bible. I think that's inappropriate at a medical facility.

Also, the TV in the waiting room was airing a Hallmark movie. A patient is not going to watch an in-progress movie, and if they catch it at the beginning, they're not going to want to leave after it has started. I shudder to think that even Fox News could have been a better choice for a waiting rooom. Obviously, this was for the benefit of entertaining the receptionist, to give him something to do in-between runs for new boxes of tissues, since he directly faced the TV. I do believe that at some point my long-suffering husband asked him to change the channel.

I'm still grateful for the ability to have an open MRI, which is the only way to go if you're claustrophobic. But I've also learned that there are open UPRIGHT MRIs in this city, which I had searched for last time and couldn't find. You're sitting straight up at that type, so it's even more open. Neither one offers the clarity of a traditional MRI, and I don't know if one has an edge over the other (and I will find out). But it's good to know that this place is not the only game in town.

Oh, and the tech personally handed me the disc, so Mr. Snotnose didn't have to touch it.

Update: I called to speak with the manager. The same guy answered the phone, after asking for my name, which I gave him. I'm sure he knew why I was calling. After putting me on hold, he returned to say that ""he was informed that the manager had just left for the day."" This is a small office. It is inconceivable that a manager could walk out of the only exit without saying ""good bye,"" or ""see you Monday."" No, this POS wouldn't put the call through. One more star deducted."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"It is embarrassing to find a new restaurant, give it a rave review, tell friends how great it is, take them there, and then have a bad experience. 

I was not going to update this review, thinking we would just not go back. But last night I met up with another Yelper, an Elite who said she couldn't wait to go after reading my review. After telling her about our last experience, she urged me to write an update. And then when I came here to do that and read the one written by Simone R., the feelings it evoked were so similar that I know it's the right thing to do.

We went last Saturday, wanting to see the show that Chef Michael had talked up incessantly during our first visit. For starts, we could not have a conversation with our friends, because it was so loud. If that were the only bit of unpleasantness, I wouldn't be giving this place two stars. But then we ordered our food.

First came the salad, along with the garlic bread. The salad was so incredibly salty that it was inedible. Our waitress, Aunt Cheryl or Cousin Cheryl (it's all family, and confusing), said she'd re-do it and make it herself. It was better.

Our friend ordered Mussels Marinara. The presentation was spectacular at first - served in a huge, covered ceramic tureen. But she had a hard time getting the contents out, and even after that, getting the mussels out of their shell, because she wasn't provided with a seafood fork. She got one after asking for it, but still struggled with getting the food onto the plate.

I ordered Chicken Marsala, which I had a tiny taste of when my husband had it last time. Too bad I didn't have a bigger taste. First, it seemed that the overly thick sauce was thickened by a huge amount of pieces of batter. But even worse, it, too, was so salty that I couldn't eat it. When I sent it back, the only thing that was different was that the cook had simply omitted the capers. Yes, I know that capers are salty. But I'm perfectly capable of distinguishing the salty capers from the rest, and it still was oversalted.

None of this would be enough for me to downgrade this place to two stars, nor is one bad experience. But the coup de grace was the attitude, and that's where Simone's review becomes relevant: When we first arrived we were received like royalty. But at the end of our sorry dinner, Michael, making the rounds in his incessantly loud and self-promotional way, came over to ask how things were. I told him about the salad, the mussels, and the fact that my meal had to be sent back. His response? A mere shrug, and he walked away without apology. He couldn't care less, and wasn't going to do a thing about it. He didn't offer to comp the dish, my glass of wine, or even offer a dessert for the table to share. Not a damn thing. I am reminded of a certain politician who is your best friend when you are praising him, but you're worthless if you're not. It's not about free food. It's about feeling like a valued customer, and we felt we were treated badly.

IMO, this is not the way to treat a customer who has not only given you an outstanding review, but who has returned with other people in tow. The lack of caring speaks volumes. When it's good, it's good. When it's not, you're SOL. The emperor has no clothes, and this is not a way to run a business. We will not be going back."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"Even though I'm a local, with two major locals' casinos near home, the casino at MGM Grand has become my casino of choice, ever since I discovered that MGM is the only brand that actually rewards its players, even us little ones.  I'm now usually there once a week, on Ladies Night Out with my other poker widow friends, but I'm not a high roller by any means.  My measly few bucks has translated into generous food comps, so I now spend my gambling dough there, instead of Suncoast (best comp: a free ice cream cone) or Rampart at the Marriott (never even so much as a key chain).

That usually means we're eating at Studio Cafe, and the result can be great or totally disastrous, depending on which chef showed up that night.  Since the bad times have outweighed the good ones, it's two stars instead of three.  But tonight the good chef clocked in.

My friend and I shared a Reuben, and it was perfectly grilled.  The corned beef was moist and not overly fatty, and the amount of dressing was just right.  The Reuben is usually a good bet, though once in a while, when the B Team is in place, it will have to be sent back to actually get grilled instead of just toasted.

My friend wanted fries, but I wanted to try to salvage an otherwise ghastly week of overindulgence - I wanted fruit.  We solved the problem by getting the fries and ordering a side of fruit.

The fries, as others have probably indicated, are served in a miniature version of a fryer basket.  Tonight they were fresh, hot, and crisp, but that's not always the case here.  The fruit cup side order consisted of exactly 10 pieces (two each) of cantaloup, honeydew, watermelon, pineapple, and strawberry slices.  The waitress must have told the kitchen we were sharing, and I chuckled as I divvied up the portion, imagining someone in the back counting out each piece and making sure it was exactly equal and divisible by two.

We each had coffee, one regular and one decaf.  I'm the one writing this review at 1:00 a.m., so guess which one I had!  I'm a Starbucks junkie, so I don't rate the coffee too highly.  It's barely passable, IMHO, but others may disagree. [Note: Starbucks is right next to the Cafe].

Gloria was our waitress tonight; she's served us before, and she's efficient and businesslike.  

The one consistent Five-Star performer at Studio Cafe is the bread that's served in a basket with meals.  It is absolutely OUTSTANDING, and I can't find bread this good anywhere else in Vegas - not in restaurants, bakeries, or supermarkets.  It's a dense, whole-grain bread covered with a fantastic New York, Eli's or Zabar's-like crispy crust.  It's the kind of stuff I'd be bringing back from the East Coast if the airlines hadn't started gouging us for checked baggage. The bread alone is worth the price of admission.  And if they ever decide to save money by changing that bread, I won't ever go back.  I'm not kidding.  It's that good.

Speaking of prices, they are - ta-da - way, way too high for what is essentially a coffee shop.  Sandwiches are around $15-16.  But if you're a tourist staying on the Strip, and want sit-down service that's a notch above the nearby Denny's, and more choices than the McDonald's in MGM's  miserable excuse for a food court, then you can give Studio Cafe a try.  And hope that the A-Team is working."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"I've been to several Bonefish outlets before my Yelp tenure, mainly on the east coast, have always enjoyed it, and never wrote a review.  This wasn't my usual Bonefish experience, but was one of those freebie seminars that we can't seem to resist when they're at a place we haven't yet been to. An hour of harangue for a free dinner.  Seems like a good trade-off to me, unless the dinner is a rubber chicken affair.  Fair to post this?  I think so, because the good was good, the bad bad, and what we had to choose from was identical to what's on the regular menu.

I didn't get to have the Bang Bang Shrimp, which has always been a favorite.  I think Bonefish started this craze, and the world copied them.  But I mention the crustaceans because I've never had a Bad Bonefish Bang Bang, and I suspect they'd be the same here.

The freshly-baked bread was excellent. I would love to have tried the olive oil/pesto dipping sauce.  But there was a sicko woman sitting across from me who, after moving my knife toward herself, then pushing it back to me (touching the blade), and then repeating that action, took command of the dipping sauce.  She'd dip her bread, then double and triple-dip again, in a Seinfeldian absurdist manner, until all the bread and the oil were gone.  Waitress brings new bread, new sauce, and it's Take 2.  Finally, I just asked for some butter and I hogged the whole wrapped pat.

I ordered a glass of their house red Sangria on my own tab.  It's made with cab, has a bit of blackberry syrup, and came adorned with two blackberries and a half slice of orange.  It was tasty, but in my book, a good Sangria has to be spiked with brandy or some other booze to give it a kick.  But at $6 a glass, I knew that wasn't happening.

The Caesar Salad was just ordinary.  I asked to go easy on the dressing, so the server brought it on the side, just fine with me.

The raison d'être for my four stars, however, was the Grilled Salmon.  That was piscine PERFECTION, slightly undercooked, moist, tender, and absolutely, mouth-wateringly delicious.  A fairly large portion, about half and inch thick, and 24 hours later, in the middle of the night when I'm writing this, I am absolutely craving another hunk of that beautiful creation.  And, having foresworn all farmed or Atlantic salmon, I vow never to learn the provenance of Bonefish salmon, lest I have to avoid ordering it in the future.  It was THAT good, and the five stars for that raised the average rating.  But I'm also trying to put out of mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results.  My choice for topping was the mango salsa - good, but without a scintilla of the spice that the waitress said it would have.  The dish came with broccoli, undercooked in a strange way, and rice.  The people who ordered the filet mignon got asparagus, which looked a damn sight better, even to this broccoli-lover.

Dessert was a fudge-covered brownie with a dab of decent vanilla ice cream.  The brownie was very, very cocoa-y, and had a strange consistency, kinda like Passover cakes that are made with potato flour - a very esoteric reference, I know.  Sorry.  I'm not sure I liked it.  But after tasting it, I know I'd never order it.  Not that I ever order dessert.  Just sayin'.

We will go back, because it was Salmon Chanted Evening.  Oh, stop groaning."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"At first we didn't see the big doors leading to the real dining room.  Just the 5 little tables and a lot of ""stuff,"" making it look like more of a convenience store than a restaurant.  On a weekday night, on the late-ish side, the only signs of life were the owner eating soup at one of the tables, and a young waitress newly arrived from Colombia, hesitantly speaking English.  No prob for me, since I speak Spanish.

I was a little dismayed to think that this ""atmosphere,"" or lack thereof, would be the stage for our first venture at this restaurant, but then I heard noise and noticed those doors.  The waitress explained that there was a meeting taking place in there, and so it was off-limits.

The owner came over and gave us a thorough explanation of the menu, making suggestions, too.  We took most of them:  a couple of empanadas and an arepa de choclo to start (choclo is the word for corn in So. America), a meal-in-a-bowl soup and an Arroz con Pollo entree to share.  Right after we ordered, the small ragtag group - some biker types, some jocks - holding the meeting in the dining room adjourned, and we were able to move into the very big and much more pleasant room.  I wondered what was so secret about that meeting that it had to be kept private???  They couldn't have taken up more than a table or two.  

The empanadas were astoundingly good.  The arepa was a little too sweet for my taste; I don't know whether the corn was just naturally sweet or whether sugar is added to the dough.  It was topped with a mass of mozzarella cheese that was probably heated a bit too long - each bite was squeaking when I chewed it.

The soup was simply fantastic, a large bowl of tasty chicken broth that was not overly salty.  We chose the one that had shredded chicken, since we're too damned lazy to deal with chicken on the bone.  This one also came with potatoes instead of rice, which was perfect, since we were having Arroz con Pollo.  And therein lies the problem:  that dish was ghastly.  Both the chicken and the rice were completely dried out.  I threw some of the parsley condiment over it to moisten it, but it didn't really help.  Normally we're not shy about complaining or returning a dish that isn't up to snuff, but this time I was too full from the soup and appetizers to start in with the wait for another dish.  So when the waitress passed by and asked about our food, I told her about the dried-out dish.  She asked if we wanted to change it for something else, and we declined the offer.

But here's the kicker, and the one thing that has really soured me about this place:  I was already outside when my husband went to the register to pay the bill, and he mentioned to the owner about the dried-out rice and chicken.  The response:  ""Well, rice dishes are always dry.""  Really?  Tell that to Mr. Risotto.  And that was the sum total of the answer.  No apology, and no acknowledgement that maybe that pot of chicken and rice had been reheated a few times too many. 

Any restaurant can have problems with any dish.  I've gone back over and over to restaurants at which we had problems, mainly because the owners were genuinely concerned about the quality of the food and desire for the customer to have a positive dining experience.  On the other hand, why should I return to a place where the reaction to a critique is a shrug, even if there are enough good things on the menu to warrant a second visit?  Karma kounts, in my book."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"We were on the Nosh Las Vegas Downtown Tour, meeting Heidy and Renee at Itsy Bitsy Ramen and Whiskey.  We were a small group, just one other couple, also locals, which made it a much more intimate experience than a larger group would have been.  Since there are so many new restaurants, thanks to the Downtown Project, we welcomed this opportunity to see the new venues and try some of their food offerings.

The tour is a combination of the restaurants and the history of the downtown area, and Heidy was extremely knowledgeable.  It was so interesting to learn about Old Vegas, and Heidy made it fun.  She had a temporary mobility problem, so she left five minutes early after most of the restaurant stops, and Renee took over leading us to each new place, capably adding her own knowledge to the mix.

At Itsy Bitsy we sampled two of their excellent potstickers while we sat at the bar.  We were told at the beginning that alcohol wasn't included, but it sure was at our final stop.  

On to Carson Kitchen, where we were seated at a table in their patio.  The manager, Matt, came out to introduce himself and talk a bit about the restaurant.  I've read and heard so much about this place, so I was a bit disappointed that we were served just their most popular appetizer, the deep fried chicken skins.  I don't like to eat fried food.  Moreover, I never, ever eat the skin on chicken.  But I gritted my teeth and tried it, and I've gotta say that they are SPECTACULAR!!  Too good, in fact.  I just couldn't stop!  Still, I wish we'd been able to try just one other thing on their menu.

Next, we walked over to the Container Park and into Cheffini's.  This tiny place started as a food cart, which is still around, and now has a more permanent home in the Park.  We were treated to a small plate containing half a Classic Cheffini dog.  This masterpiece was overloaded with the grilled frank, onions, tomatoes, jalapeños, mozzarella, crushed potato chips, pineapple sauce, mustard, mayo and ketchup. There was also a cup of green sauce, which I think was the Chimichurri, and a veggie empanada.  We also had a small cup of frozen lemonade.  Hot dogs are another ""health"" food I like to avoid, but these are Kosher beef, so I dug in with gusto.  I was totally blown away, even more so when I dipped it into the Chimichurri.  I have been craving one of these ever since.  The empanada was also great!

Our next stop, also at the Container Park, was Perch, on the second floor.  All glass windows, this restaurant (we learned) isn't a container like the other establishments, but some other kind of installation, whose name I've forgotten.  This was a sit-down experience, like at Carson Kitchen, but a bit more elaborate.  Along with bowls of sweet and spicy pecans, we were given a sampler of a wonderful seasonal beer, and then a good-size bowl of calamari.  Yeah, more fried food, but this was a tour de force: delicate calamari with jalapeño & lemon, topped with a garlic aioli.  Fabuloso! That was accompanied by a lovely white wine.

Our little dessert was at Jin Ju Chocolates, where we sampled a couple of dark and milk chocolate bites.  I have to say that, while they're okay, they are not my to-die-for chocolates.

Our tour came to a close in front of the gigantic preying mantis, where we learned of its provenance and some interesting facts about the Container Park.

Heidy and Renee were outstanding, and made the tour so enjoyable.  But I do think that it's overpriced by about $10.  Still, it was a great experience that I would definitely recommend."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"I need to have eye surgery, and came to this place because of my wonderful regular ophthalmologist, Dr. Perozek, who knows about my weird night owl schedule; though he'd be perfectly happy to do my surgery, he understands that it would be hard for me to comply with his own surgery schedule, with me having to show up at 6:30 a.m., and then again just past the crack of dawn the day after for the follow-up.  So he recommended that I have Dr. Wellish do it, because, as owner of the surgical center, his hours were more likely to mesh with mine.  How thoughtful is that?!  

When I visit Dr. Perozek, I almost never have to wait at all, sometimes maybe five minutes.  Here I was faced with a large and full waiting room, with almost every seat taken.  I suspected I was in for the long haul, and nearly four hours later I was proven right.

Reams of paperwork, more than usual.  Then some tests.  Then a long wait in another inner waiting room.  Then more tests, than another long wait in that same waiting room.  I got so fed up playing my usual word games on my phone that I started reading the Yelp reviews about this place, something I would have normally done beforehand, but didn't due to the referral and promise of surgery at a time I could live with.  After reading those reviews, I was not a happy camper.

Finally, I was taken in to the room where I'd meet the doctor.  But that's when he goes into the room to see the previous patient, so another long wait.  He did introduce himself, and apologized for the long wait (with the usual ""there were some emergencies"" excuse), but then it all broke down.  He talked really, really fast, and most of the time he was mumbling to his assistant, who was taking notes.  He told me that I had astigmatism.  I am no babe in the woods, have been wearing glasses since I was 9, and have never been told that.  When I mentioned it, he shoved a paper with colored graphs in front of me and asked ""Well, did you ever have this test?""  

He also told me that I had a severe case of dry eyes.  Yes, I know, and I'm being treated for it.  But then he produced a slick, colored brochure, outlining a complete program for dealing with the condition.  All very fast, with no time to ask questions.  What I was able to glean from this is that I would start out with a 5-day course of antibiotics (SUSPECT!).  Then follow up with antibiotic eye ointment.  I told him I had it at home, but learned later that he called it into the pharmacy anyway.  Finally, there was the real money-maker:  an eye medication that would be the gift that keeps on giving - from me to him - because it's not covered by insurance.  I kept thinking that I was in one of those incessant medication commercials that end with ""Ask your doctor about...""

My husband had to go to CVS to pick up some meds for himself.  I told him not to get the 5-day Z-pack, but I assumed the doctor had listened to me about the ointment.  Wrong!  Hubby brought it home, and I noticed that it had been prescribed with 11 refills. ELEVEN! That told me that this ""program"" for dry eyes was obviously a cash cow.

I am distrustful of doctors who push programs that look designed to keep patients tethered to them by a checkbook.  I am also distrustful of doctors who own the surgical centers in which they operate.

Needless to say, I'm meeting with my regular ophthalmologist next week for a second opinion, but he will be my first and only choice.  And I know he will listen to what I have to say and answer all of my questions.  It'll be worth forgoing a few nights of sleep."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"We've been to O'Aces at both Rainbow and Decatur, and really liked both for the more-than-decent food and the low prices.  Tonight I met up with my husband for a quick bite at the Rainbow venue.  We no longer had any Restaurant.com coupons, but knew they served till late and the prices were reasonable.  We both wanted the Asian Chicken Salad. 

It was a little past 9 p.m., and we entered to find the bar completely empty - strange for a gambling joint.  We walked past that to the restaurant area, where not a soul had survived.  It should have been an omen.

Imagine our shock when the waitress handed us a menu that said ""Angelina's Kitchen.""  Who the hell is Angelina, and why is she hanging out at O'Aces?  Sadly, O'Aces is no more, as far as food goes.  No more Asian Chicken Salad big enough to feed half of China.  Or anything else that was remotely reminiscent of the O'Aces of old.  This was Italian.  Or Italian wannabe.  I could tell, because I'm pretty smart.  Angelina is an Italian name.  And that's where the resemblance ends.

I had a hard time deciding what to order, mainly because I wasn't prepared for Italian food.  Not that I've ever been known say no to good Italian food, but I just kinda had a feeling...

Hubby ordered the Greek Salad with chicken (he must have had a feeling, too).  Nothing, but nothing was appealing to me, so I settled on just a sub, or hoagie, or hero, or grinder, or whatever the heck they call it in Vegas, where everyone comes from somewhere else.  Roast beef.  I pointed to it while I ordered it, and the waitress saw me point.  She also agreed to substitute provolonefor the white American cheese.

What seemed like an eternity later, she came out bearing two plates, and said ""Be careful, the plates are VERY hot.""  I thought that was strange:  why would a Greek salad and a roast beef sub be hot?  She put my plate down in front of me, and I stared at a huge mound of brown glop.  What the hell was it????  And then I realized that she brought a HOT, barbecued roast beef, from the LEFT side of the menu.  I guess she was dyslexic, or whatever they call people who SEE things on the left, even though they're looking at the right.  And I never did find out why the Greek salad was also on a hot plate (though DH did like it, despite the fact that his chicken looked to me like it was straight from fridge to plate without a chance to breathe).

The waitress apologized profusely, and as much as admitted that it was her mistake.  While she was changing my order, I occupied myself with one of those Wet Naps I always carry from the casinos, trying in vain to scrub the barbecue sauce off my fingers.  Just a little bit got on my hand accidentally, because there was just so much of it oozing all over that plate, and it was the stickiest bbq sauce I've ever encountered.  It must have had enough sugar to send a diabetic into a coma.

I should have cut my losses right there.  She brought the cold roast beef and prov sub, and then I learned the reason for all the sauce on the hot one:  it was to disguise the taste of the roast beef, which was arguably the worst I've ever encountered in my life.  It had no taste of roast beef, just salt and sour.  As in SOUR.  The roll was soft, as a sub roll should not be, very white, and completely tasteless.  I eighty-sixed the roast beef, and had a provolone and tomato sandwich on half the doughboy roll.  The cross-cut fries (which she and the menu called CRISS-cut), were okay.

Apparently, Angelina now makes her home at every one of the restaurants formerly known as O'Aces. (Though the bar is still called that.   I, for one (really two, if you count my husband) will stay home.  All the better to devote my time to writing witty and snappy reviews for good restaurants that deserve them."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"Some things change for the better.  Alas, not Cuba Cafe.

I wrote my last review 3 1/2 years ago and gave it four stars.  It's quite a distance from home, so we're not regulars.  I think we were there once after that first visit.  But this time we were meeting friends from Henderson and, like so many from that part of the valley, driving anywhere but nearby is an odyssey to be undertaken, well...never.  So we shlepped to East Tropicana, after convincing them that Cuba Cafe was worth their short drive.

The guys each had a Bud Light, my girlfriend ordered a Pinot Grigio, and I had a German Riesling that was excellent.  So far, so good.

We gave in our orders, and the waitress returned to tell my friend that her Mango Salmon was not to be; they were out of salmon.  She switched to Lechon Asado.  Her husband, Mr. Picky Eater, ordered Rice with Chicken Breast, probably the plainest choice on the menu.  Mine ordered Chicken in Peanut sauce over linguine, and I stayed with the same tasting plate as I had the first time, mainly because I had a hankering for maduros, the sweet plantains.  But there were just two small pieces.  My dish came complete with a serving of...ALUMINUM FOIL, nestled right in the beef.  When I pointed this out, the other waitress snatched it away, saying they'd remake it.  It's noteworthy that from the moment we entered the restaurant until our departure, there was not a scintilla of a smile from either of these two.  It was more like the ice in the water that we weren't served. 

My friend said her pork was tender, and she liked her dish.  Mr. Picky picked at his food and said it was okay.  Then again, I've never heard him rave about anything anywhere.  I had some of the linguine dish.  The chicken was very tender, but the linguine were a little too soft for my taste.  Not mushy, but I prefer al dente, which this wasn't.  Though Cuban food is not known for its spice, this was described as having a peanut-chipotle sauce, but there wasn't much chipotle to be found.  My replaced Tasting Plate was okay, sans foil, but was oversalted.  I always turn down water when it's offered, because all I ever drink is wine or coffee, but this time I sure could have used it.  Except it wasn't offered.

At 9 p.m. almost all diners were gone, and that's when an excellent latino band started to play.  I love those congas!!!  Apparently, this place turns into a club on the weekends, when they're open much later, complete with dancing.  My advice, if you're into this kind of music - my personal favorite -  is to go for a drink, the music, and some dancing.  Because if you're there for dinner...

The real ""fun"" started when we got the check, which was delivered without us asking.  No one bothered to ask if we'd like dessert or coffee.  And it was just ONE check. My friend had asked for separate checks right when we ordered.  Moreover, it's a good thing we checked that check, which is probably why it's called ""check"" in the first place.

Two beers had become four.  One pinot grigio became two.  The elusive salmon wasn't in the kitchen, but it was right there on the bill, along with the lechon asado that was substituted.  WTF???  The waitress gave us some double-talk about her ringing up the drinks and the bartender also ringing them up.  And when I asked to see a manager, this very young woman said that she was in charge.  Maybe, but it sure seemed like the other woman was more owner-like.  To their credit, they did make good on the bill by removing the extra drinks, making it two checks, and comping both my friend's and my dish, though we didn't ask for anything except to remove the charges that shouldn't have been there.  Still, it made for a very unpleasant finale to a meal that was in a nice setting but oh, so ordinary.  And I'm still thirsty."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"Pasta Cucina is the replacement for our beloved San Lorenzo, the Italian offering at Texas Station. Apparently, the expression ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" must be Greek to the powers that be - not English. Not even Italian. 

Strike One:  We tried to come here a couple of weeks ago, but at 9:05 pm we were five minutes too late. In Vegas, baby??  And, Holy Heart Failure, Batman! - the $10 coupon we had was going to expire in a couple of days. ""No problem"", said the manager. "" Whenever you come back, we'll take it."" Ha!!  Tonight's manager finally agreed to accept it, but only after grilling us so thoroughly about that other manager, whose name we never got, that he made us feel like cheats and liars.

Strike Two:  Gone is the beautiful Tuscan ambience, with its rustic walls and elegant decor.  The booths, tables, and layout are the same, but it's now more generic English Clubroom, more dark wood.  Not bad, but not as pretty.  What IS bad is that the comfortable chairs were replaced with smaller, open-back back-killers.  One of these chairs housed an enormously obese woman two tables away, and the chair looked like it wasn't going to make it.  The old leather chairs could've held two of her.

Strike Three:  Our server, Autumn, was by far the pushiest waitperson we have EVER encountered, from here to Reykjavik, and far beyond.  From the moment we sat down, she hammered away at us, trying five times - before, during, and after the meal - to get us to refill our wine.  As we finished our entrees, she asked if we'd like  a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc.  When it wasn't the wine, she was pushing the cocktails.  When we declined appetizers, she soldiered on, enumerating every appetizer on the menu, with a description of each.  They were all there on the menu - did we look illiterate? But wait.  There's more!  Desserts, each one described in painstaking detail, then the coffees.  I was hoping that the review I was drafting - with the characteristic Yelp Red emanating with such precise resolution from my iPhone - would be a warning to her.  But nooooo.  And as we walked out, I saw what one of their coffee cups looked like - the size of a Starbucks espresso (I know it wasn't espresso, 'cause I asked the woman who'd ordered it), and I sure was glad I passed on it - for two reasons, the second being that it probably infuriated Autumn even more  :)  All through the meal she kept checking on us, but it didn't come off as genuine concern.  It was always with a smarmy undertone that clearly conveyed her thinly-veiled displeasure with our small appetites.  

By now you must be wondering about the food.  After all, isn't that what it's all about?  Admittedly, I can only judge the food comparatively.  San Lorenzo was Italian (the food, not the Saint), and so is this place.  The menu is virtually the same as before, at least the entrees, since we never order appetizers unless we're with others.  And the entrees were mostly decent.  But:  my husband ordered a dinner salad, and it was mostly iceberg lettuce.  The fabulous bread that we always ate too much of is gone, replaced by white bread soft breadsticks that, though served warm, were reminiscent of Pillsbury.  The entree portions are smaller.  Before, the entree covered the plate, and the linguine was served in a separate bowl.  Now there's less of each, on one plate.  I had Chicken Caprese, which was sauteed and topped with a chopped roasted red pepper sauce, artichoke hearts, and mozzarella.  I had to dig hard to find the cheese; the roasted pepper topping was flavorful, but the chicken under it sat in a pool of water and was totally devoid of taste. To my palate, it could have been tofu. Hubby had the Chicken Piccata.  Same chicken, different sauce, which he liked.  Lemon and capers can't be all bad.

Would the food have been better if someone else had waited on us?  Maybe.  But dinner in a restaurant isn't just about the food, it's the whole experience.  And this experience left a somewhat bitter aftertaste."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"Since moving to Las Vegas (part-time) a couple of years ago, we had been looking for a reasonable, down-home, comfortable and casual Italian restaurant.  We discovered Gallo's through a restaurant discount site a few months ago, and have returned several times.  It's now ""our"" restaurant.

Gallo's isn't fancy, though there are red-checkered tablecloths on the tables and booths.  It isn't large, so depending on the evening's entertainment, it might be wise to make a reservation.  And it's a family restaurant, rather than the latest upscale bistro:  there's a small flat-screen TV on the wall in each booth, to keep the kids entertained or the family fed while dad can watch the end of the football game.

What's most important to us are three things:  the food, the value, and the feeling that we are valued customers.  Gallo's Pizza Kitchen excels in all three counts.

This is real food; no frozen breaded chopped and re-formed chicken patties for the chicken parmigiana, real cheese instead of the dreadful ""pizza cheese"" that so many pizza joints and Italian restaurants have switched to save money.  Lasagna to die for, in a portion so large I have taken home the leftovers and had it for TWO more meals.  Chicken marsala in a delicious sauce brimming with dark and meaty mushrooms.

The prices are more than reasonable, and what's more, they can be even better if you take advantage of the nightly specials.  For example, on Friday nights, the lasagna, served with a decent salad, is only $9.99.  Thursday night is ""Date Night"", and all entrees are Buy One, Get One Free.  The same goes for pizza on a different night.  The other nights have similar deals, but I haven't memorized the list.  Oh, I see that Richard N. has listed the nightly specials.

A restaurant can try to be all things to all people, and Gallo's sure is trying.  There is nightly entertainment, ranging from family Karaoke on Friday and Saturday at 9:00 pm, preceded by a Sinatra-type singer (just a guess - we haven't seen him yet) who does two earlier sets.  There's Jazz on Thursdays, Football on whatever night people watch football, and different music genres on the other nights.

In addition to great food that's priced right, the thing that sets Gallo's apart for us is the genuine warmth and caring of the staff, most notably the owner, Casey.

We generally eat dinner fairly late, and before visiting the restaurant for the first time, we called to make sure they were still serving.  The young woman who answered said they were, and that the kitchen was open until 10:30.  We arrived fifteen minutes later and were seated immediately.  But when we tried to order, the waitress said that the kitchen was closed, except for pizza and possibly a salad.  On this particular night, pizza was the last thing we wanted for dinner, and we were quite upset.  Casey, the owner, came over and introduced himself (and I was impressed by the rare admission of an owner actually calling himself that, rather than ""the manager,"" which is usually the case.  It speaks to pride and the willingness to accept responsibility).

He graciously permitted us to order what had been the Friday night special, lasagna with a salad and garlic breadstick.  The cost?  9.99.  And the lasagna is just unbelievably delicious - a huge portion swimming in a bowl of homemade sauce, with a ton of real mozzarella over all.  It could wreak havoc with a diet, or you can eat a decent amount, take home the rest, as I always do.  

On that first night, Casey was genuinely upset that we had been given incorrect information, and he was extremely generous in making up for it.  Too many times we have seen business owners - of all kinds of retail establishments, not just restaurants - who do not have the business sense to remember that a customer's good ""word of mouth"" is the best and least expensive advertising there is, and in this Internet age, it is way too easy for a dissatisfied customer to tell the world.  In the case of Gallo's Pizza Kitchen, I'm taking this opportunity to Tell the World that this is one fine establishment where the owner will go the extra mile to satisfy his customers."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"My flight arrived at 7 p.m., and after a month-long sojourn in the Garden State, I was ready to reclaim Vegas.  Hubby picked me up at the airport and suggested Capo's.  He can't resist a deal, and Tuesdays it's 2 for 1.  In fact, right under the tall restaurant sign facing East, it proclaims in big letters, not to be missed by any local OR tourist, ""2 for 1 Tuesdays.""  But more about that later.

We had a reservation and arrived a bit early, so we had to wait.  And wait some more.  So we got to hang out near the bar, with every seat filled by jocks drinking and shouting at various sports on the TVs.  No matter that the Vice Presidential debate was being aired, but not here.  I won't ding them for that, since most people wouldn't care. 

At last we were seated, but our table was at one of the booths lining the bar, not in the main dining room.  That meant hearing the clanging pots from the kitchen right behind the bar, along with the aforementioned shouting jocks.  A very short while later, I noticed that the couple who walked in right in front of us, who did not have reservations, were seated immediately after us in a nice, quiet room right off the main dining room.  Normally, I would have insisted on another table, but I was exhausted from my sleepless flight.  I was still on East Coast time and it was late, even for me.

It took quite a while for the server to come over.  He apologized, but it was indicative of the service through the rest of the meal.  Not terrible, but not attentive enough, and certainly not as good as what we'd experienced here in the past.

Prices have really increased.  Yeah, Capo's is higher end, but it's not the Strip.  At least the Sangria I ordered was a good-sized glass and was very tasty.  But the copious amount of fruit turned out to be just lemon, lime and orange peel and pith.  And the dishes are served with salad or soup, and a choice of side, so it's not all that bad.

My husband had Chicken Lucchese, with mushroom risotto as his side dish.  His chicken was a very large portion covered with mozzarella, mushrooms, capers and broccoli.  My Chicken Picatta, on the other hand, was half that size.  I wasn't terribly hungry, so this time it was enough for me to still take home some of it, but the discrepancy in size was insane, especially since his had so much more stuff on it.  And was only priced at $1 more.

When it came time to pack up the leftovers, we were provided with boxes.  I usually like to box up my food myself.  But in this case, the plates were huge and heavy, and both had drippy sauce.  After I took care of mine, Herb put that plate on one corner of the table, along with our bread plates.  There was no room to maneuver, and the plates just sat there unremoved, while wait staff walked by several times and ignored how I was struggling.  This is not a hallmark of good service.

Now for the fun part - the check.  It was not 2 for 1.  It was 2 for 1 only ""if we had ordered the same dish.""  Did it say that on the big sign outside?  Nay!  The bill was reduced by $20, not the amount it should have been.  Did it say ""$20 max"" on the big sign outside?  Again, nay.  And when we asked to see the manager, she, or someone claiming to be the manager, sat down and began a double-talk routine that would rival Abbott and Costello, telling us multiple times what I've just written above, repeating over and over that they weren't her's, but the owner's rules.  The biggest zinger, though, was when she said that the 2 for 1 was only for locals.  WTF?  Can you imagine being tourists on a budget schlepping by cab from the Strip because they heard about their Tuesday policy and finding out only at the end that they were SOL?  And did it say it on that big sign?  Third NAY.  Why would a tourist think this 2 for 1 didn't apply to them?  This has to be a blatant lie, and we don't like being lied to.  Obviously, the $4 difference in our check is small and will neither make nor break us.  But this kind of crap is not the way to run a business and alienate customers.  Is the food good?  Yeah.  But there are enough good Italian restaurants in this town with great atmosphere to ever have to put up with this."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"The gringo leaving Tony's with his take-out order threw his two cents' in as we stood outside debating whether to go into this restaurant.  He said he was a Mexican food expert and this was the best.  I beg to disagree.  All four of us do.

We found out about this new location for Tony's (we hadn't been to any of them before) from a Restaurant.com listing.  We had no idea of what to expect, but I certainly didn't expect it to look like a coffee shop.  On the weekends I like to go to a place with some atmosphere, and this looked like a corner luncheonette.  But based on the long drive we took to get there, and the other customer's recommendation, we decided to have dinner there.

Though I, like a previous reviewer, lived in Mexico, I like wine with dinner.  They don't have it.  The drink menu is beer, or a margarita from a prepared mix.  I had the margarita, which was okay, but garnished with a wedge of lemon, not lime.  This is authentic Mexican (yes, I know there are no limes in Mexico - the Mexican lemon is lime-colored, and that's what they use, but the Mexican lemon is not as sour as ours).

The waitress brought a half-filled basket of chips, and the chips turned out to be the best thing on the menu.  They're crisp, not greasy or salty, and they're small, so you don't have to waste un-dipped chip.  But, and this is a big one.  Only the first basket is free.  And you get that one basket (half a basket, in our case), whether you're one person or four, whether you order appetizers or not.  Then it's $1.50 to get it refilled.  The house red salsa was very good, if you can eat burning sauce.  Two of us loved it.  I requested green sauce, and it was a cup of water with green food coloring.  No taste, no body, just water.

One friend ordered two appetizers - bean dip and guacamole.  The bean dip was refried beans WITH LARD (I asked), covered with some shredded cheese.  The guacamole was commercial and just passable; but for 1.50, I didn't expect more.

I ordered the Bisteck [sic] Ranchera, after asking if it's the same meat used for the Carne Asada.  The waitress said it was, and highly recommended it.  It came out as small pieces of meat sauteed with bell peppers, jalapeno slices, and onions.  Normally I like that sort of thing.  But the meat was greasy, overly salty, and not tender, nor did it have that wonderful special flavor that a good carne asada has.  The meat had obviously been precooked, then cut up and sauteed with the peppers in a lot of grease.  I ordered corn, not flour tortillas, but I got the flour ones.

My husband ordered the Sopes - two thick corn (I think) discs covered with the refried slop, some shredded chicken and lettuce, and chopped tomato.  He said it was okay.  

One friend ordered the Fried Mojarra (the menu says it's tilapia, but I think it's a different fish in Mexico).  She didn't expect a whole fish, since it wasn't described that way.  But that's how it came out, head and all, and she sent it back to have the head cut off.  It was left in the deep fryer way too long and was much too overcooked and dry, close to being burned.  And she had to slog through the whole fish with her hands, since the skeleton had hundreds of bones that were too small to be able to cut with a knife, otherwise she'd be picking them out of her throat. 

Her husband made his own combination plate, with a taco, flauta, and tamale, which he said was dry, but okay when he added more sauce.

All our dishes were served with refried beans, but we all requested Frijoles de Olla, whole beans without the lard.  They were overcooked and tasteless.  The dishes also came with the typical orange-colored rice, and that, too, was soft and mushy, and the kitchen didn't even bother to heat it up.

Then the check was delivered.  Instead of a normal restaurant check, it was a register tape with absolutely no indication of what each of the long list of prices was for.  We added up the number of items we had, and we were charged for one extra item.  We could have insisted that we be given a full accounting of what all those numbers were for, but we had already spent what seemed like an eternity.  Besides, we had that discount certificate, and Yogurtland was calling us - we needed something cold and delicious to take away the bad taste.

As our friend summed it up:  ""This is one step up from Taco Bell."""
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"Have I ever told you that Indian food is my absolute favorite?  Okay, so I'll tell you again.  I've been eating Indian food since before many of you Yelpersnappers were ever born.  When I moved from Brooklyn to Queens, I was fortunate to be living a stone's throw from Jackson Heights, which was then cradle of Indian restaurants on the East Coast. It still may be.

But I moved from there to Central NJ, and all those restaurants must have heeded me and Horace Greeley, and moved west.  They all went to Edison, which became known as Little Bombay (or Mumbai, if you're a purist).  But there were - and are - also a plethora of Gujurati vegetarian joints, as well as tons of places from almost every Indian state. They've been moving west again, and now we have a growing Indian food scene here in Vegas.

Mint Indian Bistro on Durango is one of the newest, and it's a cavernous room, half of which is filled with tables and booths, the other dedicated to a bar and lounge, with a unique Lassi Self-Serve wine and beer station in the center.

We chose a table far from the door, but we were freezing.  Our obliging waiter, Jay, raised the thermostat, but that only seemed to be blowing cold air.  Turns out that our table was next to the somewhat separated buffet station area, and that must have had its own thermostat turned way down, because we got even colder.  We moved to a raised booth, and I was finally able to settle in and take my jacket off.  Even better, the booth was the right height and very comfortable.  I usually can't sit in them, since I'm too short for most and would have to eat like a dog, straight outta the bowl, and the tables are most often too far away from the seat.  This one was perfect.

No other reviews seem to be complaining, but I found the wine and beer prices over the top.  I won't pay $10 for a glass of Riesling, even if it's from Germany, unless I'm on the Strip and dying of thirst.  I've had too many good German ones at other places for a lot less.  So I had a small bottle of bubbly, and I was happy.

We like it when there's a Thali, especially when it's a new restaurant for us, because we get to sample more than a few items.  Here it's called a Prix-Fixe menu (for two), under the heading of Chef's Tasting Menu which, I guess, gives license to let them charge more!  But it is definitely a Thali, and we chose the non-Vegetarian option.  To be fair, it was somewhat different from the usual, in that we were served individual bowls of soup and individual desserts.

We started with the tomato soup, very flavorful with lots of cumin seeds to crunch on.  It seemed insanely oversalted, but I'm hoping that instead of salt it was from lemon.  It's easy to confuse the two in certain dishes.  The soup was served along with the appetizer, which we were able to change from pakoda to samosa.  The potato and pea filling was delicious, but I found the outside to be not as crisp as at other places, with a kind of different, softer texture.

The main course was accompanied by a separate small bowl of rice.  Rice was also one of the bowls on the tray.  The individual dishes were very good (lamb, vegetable curry, dal,) to excellent - tandoori chicken that had an unusually great smoky taste, and chicken tikka masala.  We didn't like the mixed pickles, but that doesn't mean they weren't good, they're just not our thing.  Yogurt instead of raita was a disappointment, but not as disappointing as the garlic naan.  It wasn't piping hot, which it should be, didn't have enough garlic, and desperately need some butter - it had none.

Much as we like gulab jamun, we chose kheer for dessert, since it's not as cloyingly sweet.  It was terrific.

Service was generally good.  While Jay seemed to be the primary waiter, everyone else pitched in.  But the problem was that when we, or any other table, weren't being served, the staff seemed to hang out in the kitchen.  So when we needed, e.g., spoons for the dal or yogurt, since none were provided, we had to wait, and wait some more, until someone decided to come into the dining room.

This venue has been open a month.  They will have wi-fi, but don't yet.  The food is mostly very good, and I hope the owner will check out all the previous comments, as well as my own, and work out the kinks.  We liked it and will come back, but it's not my favorite.  That could easily change."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"First, and it's a big first:  The menu has been changed.  It  is NO LONGER TURKISH AND MEDITERRANEAN.  And we didn't know until we were seated and looked at the menu.

We were greeted very warmly by the owner, whose name happens to be Ibo.  The main dining room is just beautiful:  perfect lighting, candles on tables that are covered with white tablecloths over skirts, large banquettes around the perimeter, attractive and heavy menus.  But alas, there was virtually no Turkish food, except for the usual hummus and babaganoush for appetizers, kofta for beef, and a chicken dish that was called Istanbul Chicken, but had nothing remotely related to Istanbul.

When I asked our waiter about this, he explained that the owner had made a business decision to change because Turkish wasn't bringing the customers, who were unused to such cuisine, and decided to make it a steakhouse.  But the lighted sign above the restaurant is the original one, so IMO, it's a losing proposition for the owner:  those thinking this is Turkish won't come because it's ""strange"", and those of us who know and love Turkish food won't return because it's not!

I asked for a wine list, and was dismayed to see that it crossed the $7 barrier - there was not a glass of wine less than $8 or $8.50, and most were more.  We were two couples, and the other couple decided to forgo the wine.  My husband and I told the waiter that we weren't going to pay $8.50 for a glass of Riesling, and started to hand him back the menu.  He then offered to charge us $7 a glass.  I didn't know you could bargain for wine!

We munched on excellent bread while waiting for our entrees.  Choosing the entrees wasn't easy, since we hadn't been expecting to be choosing from steak and Italian dishes, but we settled on two Istanbul chicken, kofte with kasseri cheese, and rainbow trout.  Entrees were served with lentil soup or salad, and garlic mashed and fresh vegetables.  We all had the salad, comprised of mixed greens, some shredded carrot and chopped tomatoes, with a choice of three ordinary dressings.  The salad was very fresh and a good-sized portion.

When the waiter brought the entrees, he told my friend to be careful, because she might find bones in her ""fileted"" trout.  It was full of bones, and she had to send it back.  Both men ordered the chicken with the butter sauce on the side.  This dish consisted of thick slices of chicken that had been rolled around a spinach and carrot filling.  There wasn't enough of the filling, and because the chicken hadn't been heated in the sauce, it was quite dry.  My friend had substituted the same chicken for her bony trout; she forgot to specify the butter on the side and the waiter didn't think to ask, so hers came covered with the sauce.  It may have been chock-full of calories, but was much moister.

My Kofte was a large portion of five patties (each slightly larger than you'd find on a slider) of the ground beef.  It was tasty, but bland, and lacking the necessary black pepper that distinguishes it from an ordinary burger.  But I had forgotten that kasseri cheese is the equivalent of parmesan, so it also added a lot of salt, too much for my taste, though many others wouldn't think so.

The big disappointment with the dishes were the sides:  the mashed and the veggies were cold.  We told this to the owner, who had stopped to check our table.  He apologized profusely and returned a few moments later with a plate filled with four scoops of hot mashed potatoes and lots of the same nice vegetables, but well-heated.

Only when I went to the lounge, which is completely separate from the main dining room, did I see a scrolling sign over the bar indicating that this is ""Ibo's Steak House."" What a shame!  Las Vegas, which has quite a few Mediterranean restaurants, really could have used a good Turkish one.  Ibo's, if ever it was one, is no longer.  

In summation, the ambience is very beautiful.  The outdoor patio is quite large and would be oh so inviting if the weather were warmer.  The lounge and bar is attractive, also filled with tables and banquettes, and is equipped to provide live music, which there wasn't on our Saturday night visit.  I don't know if they ever have it.  The owner is friendly and very eager to please.  But without the ethnic differentiation, this is just a lovely setting with good to mediocre food, and nothing else to distinguish it from hundreds of others in Vegas.  Except for what has to be a huge rent, due to the sheer size of the place, that will probably render this review obsolete within a few months."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"I would love to be able to give Baja California a better rating than three stars, but I can't.  

What's to like?  A lot, it turns out.  On the site of the former Hannah's, followed by a seafood joint for a brief moment in time, this place is spacious and beautiful.  The patio is fabulous, though it was way too cold to be of use now.  There is a cigar lounge with comfy chairs and sofas, tv, and a powerful ventilation system, so all of us addicts don't have to freeze our asses off in the aforementioned patio.  And best of all, the restaurant turns into a Latin nightclub on Friday and Saturday nights, with a live band and a large dance floor.  Unfortunately, on this Friday night, the Latin band would play for 20 minutes, then take an hour break.

We were seated immediately and were attended to a server-trainee, but the regular waiter was with him.  The menu touted their house-made Sangria, with it's ""secret ingredients,"" so we decided to go with that.  Even though the waiter affirmed that, yes, it did have liquor added to it, it turned out to taste perfectly ordinary, no better than what's in a Yago bottle.  I also ordered it without ice, and got half a glass.  Much worse, though, was that the menu was a combined food/drink one, and PRINTED in the regular menu, in bold letters, it proclaimed ""Two for One Drinks,"" anytime.  Not a card on the table, as a special promo.  Not a chalkboard special.  Just the regular, everyday policy.  We had a restaurant.com certificate, and when we got the bill, we were dismayed to see that we were charged for four drinks instead of two.  The manager was adamant and unyielding, reading from the certificate about how it's not valid with any other promos.  BUT THIS WAS NOT A PROMO!!  And she wouldn't budge.  But she did offer to bring us a Tres Leches dessert, which we didn't really want or need.  More about that later.

Some things are really strange here, foodwise.  First, the Queso Fundido appetizer.  I've spent a lot of time in Mexico, and the hallmark of this dish is the spicy chorizo blended with the melted cheese.  In this restaurant, the chorizo is listed as a $2.50 upcharge.  It's not Queso Fundido without that chorizo, so why not just make that the default and raise the price?

There was a choice of soup or salad with our main courses.  We're both nuts about Tortilla Soup, so we opted for that.  It was a very thin broth, but tasted very good, except for the chicken pieces, which I swear came from the same Costco chicken can I'd put in our salads at home the night before.  The chef passing by  swore that it was fresh chicken.  You'll have to be the judge.

I ordered the Shrimp Fajitas, and that's when it really turned to Planet Jupiter.  The sizzling shrimp came out on the standard platter, and there were a surprisingly large amount of shrimp, surrounded by the usual pepper and onion suspects.  But where was the pico de gallo, the sour cream, or any of the other accompaniments that always come with fajitas, like a bit of guacamole  ""Oh, we don't serve fajitas that way here, but I can bring you those things.""  Most incredibly, the tortillas were 4"" babies.  One shrimp, no peppers or onions or anything, and I couldn't even fold it over!  My exclamations to the waiter had him bringing out burrito-sized monster tortillas that were way too big.  I just don't get it.  And the shrimp, though plentiful, tasted a bit weird and were overcooked.  Hubby ordered the Pollo in Red Mole, which we were unfamiliar with, so we were given a taste.  It was just like the usual brown mole, but much thinner.  He got some rice along with it, but no beans and no garnish.  He did like his chicken, though.

Meanwhile, the restaurant had gotten significantly more crowded, and our trainee was nowhere to be found.  When we were at last able to flag down the waiter who'd been training him, he explained that it was the guy's first day, and he sent him home because he was exhausted.  But that made the service very slow, because our waiter was all over the place, doing it all.  He sure did stay cheerful, though, so props to him for that.

Finally, the Tres Leches was okay, but nothing special.  It wasn't soaked enough, and I found it a little bitter.  Again, hubby liked it, but he's a lot easier to please!

Yelpers note:  You will not get your free dessert if you check in and also have a coupon.  But that IS a promo, so I can't really complain about that.

Will we go back?  I'm not sure.  I'm a Latin music freak, so I loved that part of it, and despite the cliche, I'm a firm believer that you really CAN eat the atmosphere.  Maybe in Spring, when the patio is livable."
m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,"In this town, food reigns supreme, and the competition is fierce. Good customer service is the difference between redemption and dismissal. My awful experience tonight could have been chalked up to an off night and a bad waiter. But it was more than that, and in my 15+ years in Vegas, this is the first time I have ever stiffed a waiter.

I met two girlfriends here for dinner, at my suggestion. Both friends live in the same large community nearby, and since my husband wasn't as happy as I was when we were here last, I thought it was a good opportunity to go again. My friend is a new transplant, and we wanted to introduce her to a nice nearby restaurant.

The other friend is on a strict diet, and was very concerned about calories, so she asked a lot of questions about things on the menu. She decided to have only a side salad. The other friend ordered mussels in white wine sauce, with sauteed broccoli, and I had chicken marsala with the spinach side.

After her salad came, my friend asked for a little bit of bleu cheese dressing, which was supplied. The one who ordered the mussels said that they were overcooked, and the sauce was extremely salty. The portion was fairly small, smaller than many appetizer-sized portions. And my chicken Marsala was unbearably salty.

We were so busy talking that we didn't realize - until the sauce for the mussels was ready to be sopped up - that we had never gotten any bread. Cue the waiter: ""Well, you have to ask for it."" Huh? I didn't have to ask for it last time, and what Italian restaurant doesn't serve bread? Now he backtracks, and gets very snippy: ""You were all so concerned with calories that I figured you didn't want it."" We point out that only one of us mentioned anything about calories, and yes, we did want bread. My mussel-deprived friend was still hungry.

The bread doesn't come, and the third time we ask, he snaps ""Well, you do want it heated, don't you?"" By now, I'm dying of thirst from all the salt in my food. I ask for water, just a little ice. It comes with no ice. I never drink water, just coffee and wine, unless the food is so oversalted that I am parched. My wine was already gone, but I had to ask for the water. He also said that they don't add any salt to any of the food. Total bullshit. 

So now we ask to see the manager. The waiter - oh, his name on the receipt is Carlos - goes backstage, then returns and says: ""He can't come out, he's busy."" ""The manager is refusing to come out?,"" I ask incredulously. ""He's cooking."" By this time, it's near closing, and the few other occupied tables are already eating.

Meanwhile, the checks are delivered, and the friend with the salad finds that she's been charged for the blue cheese dressing. Wouldn't be a big deal, but she was never told there'd be an upcharge. Waiter gives another excuse for that, but does take it off her bill. (She had asked for separate checks, since she was hardly eating, and this place, while not Strip prices, isn't exactly bargain-basement). The friend with the mussels asks if she would have done better ordering the appetizer mussels and a side salad, which would have been a little less costly. No, he says, that's a smaller portion. Now, I do not eat mussels. But most of my friends do, and I've always been amazed at the enormity of those bowls, even when it's just an appetizer.

At long last, the bread arrives. Good bread, by the way. And brought by someone else who has now become the de facto spokesman. He acknowledges all the issues. But instead of offering a sop to three disgruntled patrons, he works on softening us up, stating that NEXT TIME we come, things will be better. We will get bread. We will get water. (Or, in the case of my friends, refills on their hot water). And no, they don't add salt to any of their food. I guess they cook with Marsala cooking wine, which has tons of salt, instead of the real thing. And by the way, he says, their pizza is terrific. It starts to work for my friends who, I guess, are more malleable than I. They start to question their very low, but not completely absent, tips. In my opinion, we should have been offered something, anything, to compensate for the meal-long problems caused by this waiter - a drink? a dessert? - either of which we would have declined. And that little gesture would have made a big difference, because it would have shown that they did value our patronage. Obviously, they don't. Even when we were the last people in the restaurant, the manager never showed. 

In the midst of trying to schedule another get-together, while dealing with a text from a neighbor telling me that another neighbor's house was broken into while they were home, I forgot to take the boxed-up half of my dinner. My husband would have eaten it, but I won't miss it. I'm still drinking water, hours later, but this time with coffee in it."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"Earlier this week I visited Hi Tea 23.5 and had a pleasant experience.

VENUE:
The venue was much smaller than I imagined it would be. There were between 6 and 8 tables and they were all full when we arrived. The restaurant looks more like a fast food joint than a relaxing restaurant. To order your drink, you have to go up to the till to place your order. 

FACILITIES:
While there, I ventured to the washroom and it was lacking toilet paper. I went outside to tell an employee and she told me it was too busy for her to refill the washroom and she asked me to use paper napkins instead. This attitude really unimpressed me. 

FOOD:
Between my friend and I, we ordered 4 items. He ordered a cheese mousse beverage, which he enjoyed and I ordered their special butterfly tea, their ice ball served with liquid nitrogen to share and a ginger and ginsing hot tea. 

Butterfly Tea:
The butterfly tea drink tastes really yummy and looked really pretty but it didn't blow me away. It tastes like an iced tea lemonade that I would get at Starbucks but it was purple due to the Butterfly Pea tea they used to colour it. 

Ice Ball Dessert:
The ice ball dessert was made without the yogurt to be dairy free. I wish the employees told me the dessert would be a bowl of coconut milk with all of the toppings inside. Parts of this dessert tasted pretty gross. I honestly would not get this again. It is possible it would taste much better with the yogurt than the way I received it.

Ginger Ginsing Tea:
My ginger ginsing hot tea was purchased to soothe my soar throat and it tasted really good. It reminded me of a ginger honey tea I purchase at a nail salon. It was really yummy and I definitely recommend this drink.

Outcome:
All over, I wasn't really impressed with this restaurant and I found it just average. The prices were pretty low, so I wasn't too upset but I wouldn't trek back any time soon."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"My boyfriend and I stopped by here over the weekend and had an ok experience.

The restaurant has some weird rules that do not allow you to buy drinks if you choose to wait for a seat on the patio. Ok! We decided to wait and ended up waiting about 10 minutes.

When we got to the patio, the waitress was trying to squish an extra table onto the patio since it was jazz fest and in really high demand. This left us with very little room to sit comfortably until about 10 minutes later when they returned and told us it looked like too little space and they were going to set the tables up the way they were originally. Lol 

The Food:
I ordered a chicken sandwich with gluten free bread and my boyfriend ordered a chicken kabob dinner. The only gluten free items were a beet salad, which I didn't think would be filling enough and the chicken sandwich. I had a feeling I'd feel more full with that so that's what I got. The salad portion of my meal was just a combination of mixed greens without any vegetables. I thought that was kind of odd so I added some of the tomato from my sandwich onto the salad. Unfortunately the gluten free bread was buttered. It tasted like butter and I didn't bother asking as they weren't the most hospitable employees but I began to experience problems after. I'm assuming they forgot butter has dairy in it and someone just added it to my bread out of habit. Oy Vey!

My boyfriend enjoyed his dinner and was surprised they couldn't make the souvlaki gluten free. I was too but oh well. 

The Drinks:
I ordered a lime margarita and it was really good. It was a big portion and it tasted delicious. My boyfriend ordered the only beer they had on tap and he enjoyed it. 

Would I return?
Possibly but it wasn't exactly my favourite restaurant and the employees had attitudes that weren't too appealing. With that being said, the waiter who ended up serving us was really nice."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I came here to celebrate my sister's birthday and we had a good experience. There were some gluten and dairy free options on the menu (phew) and I ordered the pollo tinga.  To make the pollo tinga gluten and dairy free, I had them omit some of the toppings.  Even without all of the toppings, I found my tacos to be quite yummy.

We also ordered the guacamole and chips. They were really good and I highly recommend them.  However, I'm not totally sure everything I ate was gluten free because I did experience some digestive issues during the meal.  Luckily, it was nothing too serious but I did feel really uncomfortable.

The good news is, my sister had a wonderful time!  She had a bunch or tacos and ordered the churros for dessert.  The churros are served in a chocolate pudding, which made the experience more memorable.

Our waiter was also really nice but the service was kind of slow.  I think the restaurant was understaffed.  This restaurant was packed and I don't believe they had one empty table.  The entire time we were there, I did not see our waiter take one break.  He was go-go-go!  Our waiter forgot to bring us condiments, beverages and cutlery when asked. On average, it would take about 30 minutes for any additional requests to be met.  His amazing personality helped ease the situation while some of us were waiting for things we needed to go with our meals.

The one thing I really did not like about this restaurant was they provided our table of 12 people with one bill.  That made paying quite difficult at the end of the night because everyone ordered tons of tapas, drinks and it was hard to figure out how much each person owed.  It would have been much easier to have separate bills or the bill divided by seat.

Allover, it is possible I might return to this restaurant for another dining experience, since I noticed they have ceviche on the menu and I would love to try it."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I finally made it to Sorelle & Co and had an amazingly experience. I ordered a strawberry cheesecake and a raspberry and chocolate donut for my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday. I also got a tea latte to-go. 

Ambiance:
First off, the cafe is absolutely spectacular! The interior is adorable and the perfect venue for a date, teas with the girls, family events, bridal showers and more. I honestly can't get over how beautiful this cafe was. 

Service:
The service was fantastic! All of the employees are professional and very nice. They helped me decide which desserts to buy and processed my order really efficiently. 

Packaging:
My desserts were packaged beautifully in a floral box and placed into a really nice travel bag. Everything about this cafe seemed fancy and elegant. I was worried my desserts wouldn't travel well but they looked amazing when I arrived at my final destination. 

Desserts:
The raspberry chocolate donut tasted great! It was really rich and flavourful and I loved the chocolate frosting on top of the donut since I have a real sweet tooth. The donut was everything I expected and more. I found the texture of the donut a little weird but still really enjoyed the flavour. The donut was my boyfriends favourite dessert and my favourite dessert was the strawberry cheesecake. 

The strawberry cheesecake was absolutely delightful! Each serving is presented beautifully on its own. Each piece is round with a transparent fruit topping and gold edible flakes. The cheesecake was less sweet than the chocolate donut and the flavour was light and refreshing.

Both desserts were dairy and gluten free and I would highly recommend this cafe. 

Tea Latte:
My tea latte was really good. I ordered the celebratory Rooibos tea and really enjoyed it as a latte made with coconut milk. It was sweet and definitely helped me get through the afternoon hump.

Would I go back?
- Definitely!!!"
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I came to the Beet with some friends and had a really good time. The cafe is really small but the menu makes up for that.

The Beet is a really healthy vegan friendly restaurant. This is perfect for anyone who is either/both lactose and gluten intolerant. When I heard about this cute cafe, I had to try it.

The Beet has tons of organic juices and green smoothies. They also have a great menu. They have main entrées, breakfast choices, desserts and sides that can be made gluten and lactose free.

I was so impressed when I saw lactose free cheeses on the menu. This is the first time I have seen lactose free cheese on a menu anywhere in the city. Can you imagine how excited I was?

I ordered the Buenos Dias Wrap and it was phenomenal. I arrived at the restaurant not too hungry but I ate the entire thing because it was so delicious!  Substituting the cheese for the vegan cheese was the icing on the cake. It gave my wrap such an amazing flavour lactose free clientele can't experience at too many places in the city. 

Our waiter was really friendly and we all enjoyed our meals. We ordered the vegan Mac and cheese, the green lentil vegan burger and a grilled cheese sandwich I believe. All over, we all enjoyed our dishes. However, my friends daughter didn't really like the Mac and cheese. It might be because it was vegan and she wasn't used to that. 

We then tried the desserts and were really impressed. I tried the peanut butter cookie and it was delicious. I was so full at this point that I couldn't try the cake. One of my other friends tried the sipping chocolate and she really liked it.

The one flaw was this restaurant is so popular that they had run out of a few things by the time we got there. They no longer had potato wedges, garden tacos and one of the soups. The good news is this means everything is super fresh and made daily like you would expect at any good quality restaurant."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I've been here a few times and have had an ok experience. 

The Game Area:
On the weekend the game area is really packed. It's so packed that it takes over an hour to get into the Rec Room and then you have to wait in huge lines to play random games. Don't even think about the basketball as you might have to wait an hour. The area is also really crowded that it might make you feel claustrophobic. 

I recently visited the rev room on a Sunday evening and it wasn't as busy. There were still lines to play each game but we did not have to wait an hour to load our game cards. 

The Stage:
Recently I discovered the Rec Room has a huge area in the back for private events. We came to the Rec Room to watch the magician illusionists and the back room is huge and so cute. They have European phone booths everywhere for photo opportunities and nice circular coaches surrounding coffee tables for large groups. It felt like a fancy lounge. I'd love to venture back to that room for more events. 

The Parking:
There is one lot close to the Rec Room and it costs about $30 to park for the evening. We were shocked. I'd definitely suggest the TTC or parking further away and enjoying a nice stroll to the Rec Room. 

The Restaurant:
The last time we tried to dine at the restaurant we waited the suggested hour and were then told it would be a few more hours. We were famished and went someplace else to eat. It's definitely difficult to get a table here over the weekend. 

The Bars:
The drinks are good but pretty basic. They don't have too many fancy cocktails. I ordered the coco loco drink, which featured coconut water, tequila and some other ingredients and I found it to be really strong. 

Snacks:
They provide guests with free popcorn. You just have to ask. Tonight it was really salty. I'd give it 2 out of 5 stars. 

Would I Return?
Possibly but I really prefer Dave and Busters. Don't forget to collect your scene points."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"Honestly, this was one of the worst shopping experiences of my entire life. The employees were extremely rude and treated me horribly. They made snarky comments about how I didn't need a new coat and much more. When I returned with a bunch of friends, since I now had a huge store credit, the sales associate wouldn't even pull a coat for me to try on since he said, ""I tried it on the day before"". I then told him that I wanted to try it on for my friends so I could get their opinion on the coat. The sales associate then walked away. Talk about rude!

I just spent over $1000 in their store and they just walk away??  Are you kidding me??  

Luckily I had three amazing friends with me who helped me pull and try on as many coats as possible to find one that would be a decent fit for the cold winter months ahead. 

This store would not give me a refund.  Any other store would have given me a refund or purchased the coat I wanted in the bigger size. I couldn't believe the snarky comments coming out of the employees mouths. My friends were flabbergasted at the attitude the employees were spitting out at us. 

I will NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN!!!!  I rather go to a store like Holt Renfrew or Mendocino where they do what needs to be done to make the customer happy. Holt Renfrew will fix products that need mending and their customer service is way better. Mendocino would have ordered me the coat in the larger size in a heartbeat. 

This store was so nice to me when I spent over $1000 here but as soon as I wanted to make an exchange or get a refund they couldn't care less. 

I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS STORE AT ALL!!!  I will NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN!!!

I learnt my lesson about buying a big ticket item at a mom and pop shop. I will never make this mistake again. It's a shame because I'm sure there are great mom and pop shops where they care about their customers but this store DOES NOT CARE about anyone except their check book."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I am not a fan of the TTC for anyone who needs to travel long distances.  I took the TTC for the first time in 9 months yesterday and was reminded why I will never commute by TTC on a daily basis again. I was supposed to get to Yonge and Dundas in 30 minutes from Finch station. That is the ETA when everything goes according to plan. Well this trip did not go that way. There was a delay (very common on the TTC) downtown at Queen station. It took me 40 minutes to get to Davisville. My 30 minute trip took me an hour and 10 minutes to get from Finch station to Yonge and Dundas station. I had someplace to be and the TTC let me down. 

Flashback to when I was working downtown!
... at least three times per week it would take me 3 hours to get home from work due to delays. Until the TTC can fix these delays for everyday commuters, the TTC is definitely not the better way to travel.

By all means, if you live in the downtown core and can hop on a bus or a streetcar or even walk this wouldn't affect you as much. During my commutes, while I worked downtown, three alarms would get pulled during my Monday morning commute. Each alarm is a bare minimum of 15 minutes lost in travel time. That would add an additional 45 minutes to my commute every Monday morning. How ridiculous is that!!!

Currently I drive downtown 90% of the time and I can get home really quickly after any event. I know I'm not saving the environment but until the city can improve their service, TTC will stand for take the car.  

THE PROS:
- Taking the subway is a green method of transportation that helps save the environment 
- Save on downtown parking costs

THE CONS:
- Major Delays
- Unreliable
- Inconvenience
- Too hot in the summer if you get stuck under ground
- Too cold in the winter whenever the doors open
- No alternate routes to biomass stations with delays
- Cannot keep up with infrastructure of the city and the current/future population in the GTA"
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I feel really badly writing this review. First of all, I have to say the women working here are so nice and sweet. 

I came in for a deluxe pedicure and a shellac manicure. It took over 2.5 hours to do this and the lady painting my toenails shaped them incorrectly and didn't cut any of my cuticles or the dead skin around my nails. The reason I get a pedicure is to remove the dead skin on my feet. After I got home, I pulled out my cuticle clippers to get the effect I expected to receive at the salon. 

I also told the lady to not cut my fingernails and to just fix the two that were longer than the rest. She shortened all of my nails and they are too short for comfort. They are also crooked and don't have a perfect shape that you would expect at the salon. I told the lady this during the manicure and she tried to fix it but was unable to without making my nails even shorter. She asked another technician to try and fix my nails. The other lady was able to make it look better but at this point it was so late that I had to cancel my evening plans. I was also famished so I told her that it didn't matter and I just wanted to leave.

Two of my fingernails were chipped when the first Lady was painting them. They put another top coat on all of my nails because of this but did not offer to repaint those two nails. They look even shorter because of the chips. 

I would not go back to this salon. The ladies really tried hard to make me happy and they were very kind.

They have a deal where they sell a package of 5 or 10 mani/pedis that you can buy at once for future visits. It breaks down to $39 for each visit. 

The salon was also very clean including the restroom. 

To compensate for making my nails very short, they took the tax off of my bill. I still tipped them well but I don't think I'll be back. I can shape and paint my nails better than how they did them at this salon.

It might be worth a visit. Perhaps the technician was just having an off day."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"My boyfriend and I came here on Friday and had a really positive experience. We stopped in after an event and were looking for a yummy meal.

When you first walk in, you'll notice a Mexican flag covering the door and a long narrow area for guests to sit. Our waiter came over and seated us at a table. The restaurant was dimly lit and it created the perfect environment for a date night. 

We asked our waiter which tacos he would recommend with my two food allergies (I'm both gluten and lactose intolerant) and he recommended we try La Tinga and El Nopal. We also ordered two Lime Margaritas. 

La Tinga Taco
La Tinga is a chicken taco served on a soft corn tortilla. We both found this taco a little bland. The chicken didn't have much flavour; we couldn't really taste the chipotle sauce, the red sauce or the flavour of the onions. (If you visit this restaurant I do not recommend you try this dish). 

El Nopal Taco
I was surprised the waiter suggested we try El Nopal taco. It is a vegetarian taco and I didn't expect it to be as good as La Tinga. To our surprise, El Nopal pushed La Tinga out of the water. El Nopal was absolutely fantastic! It is made with a corn tortilla, cactus strips marinated in a green tomatillo sauce, coriander and crispy tortilla bits.

This was my first time trying a cactus dish and I absolutely loved it! The tacos had a lot of flavour and the cactus flesh was the texture of a root vegetable. I honestly don't know how to explain the flavours of this dish but it is definitely something you need to try!

Lime Margaritas:
We ordered two lime Margaritas and really enjoyed them. I was surprised they arrived on the rocks instead of as a slushy (I missed that memo in the menu) but it was prepared really well. The drinks has the perfect tart flavour and they were quite refreshing.

Would I Return to this restaurant???
Absolutely!!  I'd love to try some of their other tacos and I love how they can accommodate different food intolerances."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I came to Friday Night Live at the ROM last week and had a really good time. The experience is great when you go with friends whose company you can enjoy while waiting in line. Immediately upon arriving there were two lines. One was for people who did not have tickets and the other was for people who purchased their tickets online. If you didn't have a ticket, you had to wait in line to buy it and then move to the next line with people who bought them online. The line for people who purchased their ticket online took about 10-15 minutes to get through.  Upon entering the ROM there was another line for coat check but I didn't bother waiting, since my friends were already inside. I caught up with them and they were in the line to purchase food and drink tickets. The line was also long but I don't know how long they waited to get to the front.

We first made our way to the upstairs lounge/bar where we all ordered drinks. They had nothing fancy but were able to mix fruit juice, alcohol and soda. We then walked around to check out some of the exhibits, food vendors and DJ's. It was fun to have live music wherever we went. We then decided to wait in line to see the new whale exhibit. The line took about 30 minutes.  The exhibit was really good and we got to see it the night before it opened to the public. They even had an exhibit where you could dress up as a krill. We convinced one of our friends to dress up in the costume and that was fun.

After checking out the whale exhibit we tried some of the food provided by the different vendors. Once again, the lines were kind of long but there were some options that were both gluten and lactose  free.  We then walked around and viewed the dinosaurs and the natural stones exhibit. 

Allover it was a really fun event and it only cost $15.00, which is definitely a bargain. If you go during the day, you need to be quiet and it would cost $30.00 to attend. I would definitely attend Friday Night Live at the ROM again."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I feel really badly when I write a negative review but I have such a bad taste in my mouth I want to save other unsuspecting customers from the experience I endured. I heard about Studio Fontana on a Facebook group. The lady quoted me a price under $130 for dye, cut and style.

When I arrived at the salon they were behind schedule. The lady met me and was really friendly. She then began to do my hair. After she washed out the dye I noticed my roots were still very dark and I asked her some questions about my hair.  She then revealed, she used a temporary dye on my hair (what??? Are you kidding me!!) and she is going to charge me more to re-dye my hair because she will now have to use more dye and it will come out of her pocket. Okay, so now I'm being charged for her mistake??

If she did it right the first time, I wouldn't be in this situation. No salon has ever used temporary dye on my hair. Now, instead of leaving at a normal hour, I was stuck waiting for her to finish my hair until midnight. During the 6 hours I was stuck at this salon I was famished. I wanted to eat dinner but could not because I was sitting in the salon. I also didn't want to eat dinner at midnight since it was time for me to schlep home and go to bed.

Any who, my hair looked good when I left the salon but the next day something glorious happened. After I went in the shower (the stylist said this was okay) the dye ran out of my hair and I had no more dye in my hair. My hair faded in one wash!  Was this really permanent dye?  I really don't think so!  I've dyed my hair for years and have never experienced anything like this. 

I would honestly NEVER return to this salon. Yes, the lady was nice but I've never had my hair fade in one day. This was a horrible experience and I had to go pay another salon to fix their mistake. 

Talk about a pricy haircut and dye job. Now I had to spend another $200 to redo what Salon Fontana didn't do Right the first time. 

I don't recommend this salon at ALL."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I came here tonight for Winterlicious and my family and I had a really great time.  The service was a little bit on the slow side but the food was good.

I started with the beet appetizer and it was AMAZING!  It was really tasty and full of wonderful and healthy flavours.  My sister's fiancé had the Crispy Pork Belly and he said it was really good.  The rest of the people at the table had the Baked Goats Cheese appetizer and said it was kind of bland.  I also found it a bit bland when I tried it but my dad really enjoyed it.  I guess it really depends on your taste buds.  The cheese didn't taste like your traditional goat cheese; it had a flavour that was barely there and hard to pick up.  If you are a tea drinker, it almost had a buttery flavour like a nice oolong would.  

Next, I had the salmon entree and it was to die for!  The salmon was made to perfection and the mustard crust (this could have been an accommodation since I am gluten intolerant) and mango salad were fantastic!  The topping on the salad was almost like a mango chutney and I added it on top of the salmon for extra flavour.  It was spectacular!  My sister and her fiancé had the steak and it was a bit chewy.  It wasn't the best steak that I have ever had but it passes if you have to have/satisfy a red meat craving.  My parents both had the Grilled Black Tiger Shrimp Roasted Corn Salad and Chipotle Aioli.  They both really enjoyed it!

For dessert, we tried the Flourless Chocolate Cake and Crème Brûlée.  Both desserts were amazing!  I highly recommend them!

If you are looking for a bigger portion, I would recommend you get the Flourless Chocolate Cake since it was substantially bigger.  I was very happy with my chocolate cake because it was both gluten and lactose free.  It had the perfect rich chocolate flavour.

Allover I would give this restaurant a 3-Star Rating.  I would stick to the seafood and expect longer than normal service so go with good company.  The employees were super friendly and great!"
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"Tonight my friends and I went to Tapas at Embrujo for Summerlicious and we had an ok experience.

THE AMBIENCE: 3-Stars
The ambiance was nice and we enjoyed the way the restaurant was set up.

ENTERTAINMENT: 2-Stars
Halfway through our meal, performers started playing music very loudly. People throughout the restaurant began asking for their bills to leave. I even asked the waiter if he could turn down the speaker a little bit and he said no. Luckily, I had ear plugs in my purse (from IMSA the weekend before) but I still felt deaf after they stopped playing the music. It was way too loud and made simple conversation a struggle. 

THE FOOD: 3-Stars
We all ordered the anchovies appetizer. It tasted quite salty but had lots of flavour. I was surprised at the vast flavour pallet in this one small dish. I would definitely order this again. 

Ironically, we each ordered the paella for our main dish. The paella was presented nicely on a bed of rice and it had a very nice flavour. Towards the end of my dish, I noticed it was also quite salty but as an entree once in a while, it should be okay. 

For dessert we got interesting. We each ordered something different. I ordered the flan and wasn't too impressed by it. It started to upset my stomach and the texture seemed a little off. This is definitely a dish you would order if you have a sweet tooth. 

One of my friends ordered the Spanish Almond Cake and said it tasted stale. She said it was really hard and she could have done a better job making a cake herself. 

I saved the best for last. Our other friend ordered the goat cheese fritters with honey and she said it was ok but not amazing. 

SERVICE: 2-Stars
The service was not up to par. The waiter was really nice but he forgot to bring us a jug of water numerous times throughout the evening. I would ask and have to remind him 20-30 minutes later and then repeat. 

GRAND SCORE: 2.5 Stars

Honestly I am glad we came here for Summerlicious because I don't think I would go back to this restaurant again."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"Today a friend and I came here for lunch and we had a great experience. We both ordered the rice noodle bridge, which comes in 1 of 5 different soup broths and is available until April 31st. They sell 50 per day, so if you want one, make sure you go between 11am and 2pm. 

You get to choose between the original rice noodle broth, a tomato broth, a spicy Sichuan broth, coconut curry and spicy pickled pepper. My friend ordered the tomato soup and I chose the curry. We both loved our own broth and were really happy with the experience. 

The Food: 5 Stars!
The rice noodle bridge comes with A lobster tail, a French kiss oyster, shrimp, scallops, tofu, crab, beef slices, quail eggs, fish cakes, enoki mushrooms, and ham. It arrives beautifully on a tiered wooden serving dish. It looks so stylish and they bring each dish out with dry ice so it is steaming hot. The waiter explained that we should place the meat and mushrooms in first so they would cook properly. 

We took our photos (make sure you check them out) and then began to put the ingredients into our broth. The combination was scrumptious and so delicious. Since we arrived right at 11am to avoid the crowd, this was my breakfast and lunch. It was really satisfying and I didn't leave feeling like I had eaten too much food. It was the perfect amount. 

My coconut curry broth was gluten and dairy free and I'm so glad I ordered it. It wasn't too spicy except for a few parts where I scooped up extra spice but it was fantastic. My friend said her tomato broth was amazing as well. 

The Service:
The Service was fantastic. They checked in on us to bring us napkins and make sure we were enjoying the food. They also didn't rush us out at the end, which allowed us to chit chat. 

The Ambiance:
The ambiance was nice. It's a low key vibe and definitely a hidden gem.

The Price:
The price is amazing. This dish only cost $19.99 and you get an oyster and lobster tail. I was really happy with the value.

Would I go back?
Absolutely! You can't beat the price and experience."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I stopped by this restaurant yesterday and the service was fantastic but the food items I purchased didn't really make the cut. 

The ambiance:
This is a small casual restaurant with communal tables and some smaller and more private tables. They have some tables along the wall that feature really big seats with very little leg room. It was actually a weird set up, so I found another style table to eat at. 

The Service:
The employees provide excellent customer service. You first place your order and then the food you bought is delivered to your table by one of the runners. The food was prepared quickly and both employees I spoke to were really nice. The one flaw was they weren't the best at multi-tasking. 

The Food:
I ordered the El Nemo Bowl and their chocolate brownie.

The El Nemo bowl seemed a little bland. It was made with lime green cabbage, jalapeños, blue corn tortilla chips, cilantro, brown rice, san diego crema, lime wedge, roasted steelhead salmon, avocado, and red radish. I honestly felt like the bowl was missing something. It didn't have that exquisite flavour I would expect from a bowl style meal. I felt like there was too much cabbage and not enough flavour. This is the most expensive bowl and I felt like it was not worth it. I wish the associate told me this when I placed my order. She recommended the bean dish but didn't say why persay. 

The brownie was served in a brown paper bag and it was more similar to a chocolate than a brownie. It tasted like they blended chocolate and water together and served that. The brownie was really sticky, messy and not rich in flavour. It was rich in dark chocolate flavour but didn't have the brownie texture or creaminess you would expect from a brownie. I was really disappointed with this and would not buy it again. 

Would I go back?
I might go back to try what the employees recommend but I would not buy what I bought on my first visit. 

Final Notes:
The food I ordered was worth 2 stars.
The service I received was worth 4 stars. 
The ambiance is 2 stars"
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I was not impressed with this restaurant. I came here for dinner and the menu was very limited for someone who is both gluten and dairy free.

The Breakdown:
Food: Not so great; Not allergy friendly
Service:  Excellent 
Ambiance:  Nice

We started our meal with some oysters, which tasted delicious!  I have to give them credit for having yummy oysters but they only had two varieties to choose from. We ordered both to try and I really liked the Raspberry Points oysters, which were much more sweet and creamy than the French Kiss oysters. However, my friend preferred the French Kiss oysters. 

The menu had what looked like an amazing swordfish dish but the waitress told me the chef would not be able to make it dairy free. At other restaurants, they would be more than willing to customize the dish to my dietary restrictions. I was kind of surprised by this attitude and slightly disappointed. 

I ended up ordering the rainbow trout plain with no seasoning since it was the only thing the waitress recommended for my diet. I found the fish creamy but it was really bland. I slathered lemon juice all over it but it still didn't have a lot of flavour. My meal also came with vegetables, which were supposed to be steamed but they were very flavourful and my friend said they tasted like they had butter on them as his were supposed to be steamed as well. Let's just say, he was probably right because shortly after I ate my meal, I began to have terrible stomach cramps and other issues associated with lactose intolerance.

My meal also came with mini potatoes. I have to say, the potatoes were the most flavourful thing on my entire plate. They tasted delicious!

I was very happy with the service. Our waitress did an amazing job at refilling our water and checking in on us. The view of the harbour was also really nice and I enjoyed the live entertainment. 

With that being said, I would probably not return to this restaurant. Diana's oyster house does a much better job at preparing yummy seafood and they have a much more extensive oyster menu with lots of variety to choose from."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I recently celebrated my birthday at Aviv and had a really good time. The owner was really nice and said he would have a gluten and lactose free dessert for me since it was my birthday. When we spoke it was as if he was going to make my group a chocolate cake but when we celebrated, I was brought some macaroons and chocolate cookies. I think he over promised and under delivered and it made the end of the night slightly disappointing. 

The Good!   At this restaurant the bar tender is famous. The bar tender is from this show called the Thirsty Traveler. My friend recognized him from the show and we asked if he could come over to our table for some photographs. He accepted our enquiry and was a true sport. We got tons of photos and he was really nice. He also made me his best drink and it was superb. It was a grapefruit martini and it was really refreshing!

The food at Aviv was good. It didn't knock me out of the park but it was fine. My appetizer was ceviche. I absolutely love ceviche. It is one of my favourite meals and the ceviche tasted great!

Next, I tried the Moroccan Vegetable Tagine. It was also really good. On the winterlicious menu, this was the only entree I could order. I was a little disappointed because I would have liked to try the cod. However, the Tagine tasted good.

My friends seem to have liked their dishes. One friend ordered a pizza and said it was fantastic. One of my friends who ordered another dish (not sure which one) said she should have ordered the pizza.

There was also one flaw. We placed 11 orders and one of the orders didn't arrive. I felt so bad eating my entree in front of my friend. She encouraged everyone to eat their meals. I kept trying to get the attention of the waiters/waitresses to come and address her missing entree. It was hard to get any of their attention. Once a waitress arrived, she apologized profusely and placed her order again saying they messed up in the kitchen. My friend had to wait a long time to get her dish. I felt so bad for her and she said she was really hungry.

Allover I would give Aviv three stars.
The food is good and the bartender is awesome!"
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I came here the other night with a big group of people and we had a really nice time. When you first walk in, the restaurant asks you to please take off your shoes. Word of advice: It's a great idea to wear socks if you don't want to use the slippers provided by the restaurant and if you want to leave with clean feet.  I'm a bit of a germaphobe, so I wasn't too thrilled about taking off my shoes.

From afar, the restaurant looks small but once you are inside, you realize it is much bigger.  The venue has tons of seating and a bohemian-like ambiance. Bampot provides guests with little nooks where they can relax in a comfortable environment. The nooks have carpeting and pillows for you to just lounge. They also have some traditional table settings as well. The idea is to make you feel at home. 

The restaurant also has a room with shelving and tons of games available for play. We didn't play any games on this night but it was nice to know we had the option. 

The menu is also pretty awesome! Bampot can accommodate vegans and people who are gluten and/or lactose intolerant. Talk about a win!

I shared a vegan cheesecake with a friend and it was the best gluten and dairy free cheesecake I have ever had!  I would revisit Bampot just to have another slice of the blueberry cheesecake.  While there, I also tried the gluten and dairy free stew and falafels. Both dishes tasted amazing! I especially liked the falafels. 

Now onto the tea (the real reason we came here). Bampot has an extensive tea menu. They have tons of teas for you to choose from including some featured teas such as Unicorn Blood. It sounds disgusting but it is oh so amazing. My friend bought it and it was delicious. 

Later in the evening, I described the type of tea I was craving to the waitress and she created a tea blend that wasn't on the menu just for me. The tea tasted amazing and everyone in our group tried it and loved it as well. Of course, I had to ask the waitress what she did and she told me she blended strawberry kiwi and apple cider tea. This combination is so amazing, you'll have to try it!!

I highly recommend this restaurant café and believe you will love it too."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"My family and I came here earlier today and I was surprised in a few ways. On yelp, this restaurant had an almost perfect rating and I imagined it would be more of a formal sit down restaurant than a fast food joint. I put my first impression aside and decided to enjoy the dining experience.

The restaurant had maybe five tables that can hold about 4-6 people (they also have one high chair onsite for toddlers). My family looked at the menu and placed their orders while I went up to the cash register to speak with the employees to find out what items I could eat. The employees brought out some of the packaging and I discovered I could safely eat their tacos, since they use corn tortillas. Talk about being lucky!  When the employees were ready to make my tacos, they called me over and let me pick all of the toppings. There were so many great toppings to choose from including shrimp ceviche, mango, pesto, pickled turnips and more. My taco looked so colourful when they finished adding the ingredients; I was very happy with my choice. 

Everyone else ordered some of the meat dishes including: carne asada, chicken and ribs. My family found the meats a little over cooked but still flavourful and they all loved the side-dishes. Some of the sides included shrimp ceviche, arroz con pollo, salads and more. We also ordered guacamole and chips to start and everyone loved them (I could eat the guacamole but not the chips). 

My tacos tasted amazing. The toppings I choose were selected to make it juicy without using cheese and sour cream, which both include dairy. Allover, my tacos tasted fantastic! My only complaint was the meat was a bit tough at the bottom of my tacos. Luckily the toppings I choose helped make it go down a little easier. 

Allover, I would say this restaurant is a solid three stars (good in my eyes). The only thing that would make this place better is not overcooking their meat. 

The guys working there were from Venezuela and they were really nice. We also ordered pops from the fridge behind the cash register. I tried the guava one and really enjoyed it. My father tried a yellow one (I think it was pineapple flavoured and he really enjoyed his as well)."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I came here with a friend and it was an ok to moderately bad experience. When we arrived the bar tenders were super friendly and they were the first to greet us. We  continued to walk in and found the check-in table at the back of the venue just past the bar. We checked-in and were given a buzzer for when our service would begin. We were then asked to go and choose our colours and then order a drink at the bar. 

THE AMBIANCE:
The venue is set up like a fancy bar with cocktails, tables, a patio, manicure/pedicure stations and a DJ. 

THE SERVICE:
This was not the best service I have ever received. When I sat down with my pedicurist, I told her I wanted her to use a file to shorten and shape my nails. She immediately pulled out a clipper and clipped some of my nails after I told her not to do that. When she clipped my nail, she made the middle of my nail way too short while the edges were much longer. I told her the shape I wanted and  she said there is no way to do that now that it has been clipped. She tried to fix it but it was not possible due to how short the middle of my nail was. The way she was filing my nail began to hurt my foot as she was rubbing the skin instead of the nail. I asked her if I could do it and tried to fix her mistake but it really didn't look that great at this point. Once I made the nail look presentable, she began to clip the sides of one of my nails. I had to tell her not to do that or it will give me an ingrown toenail. Throughout my service I could not relax because I had to watch everything she was doing very closely. At the end of my pedicure, I told her thank you, since it's the polite thing to do and she rolled her eyes at me. I couldn't believe an employee at an establishment like this would roll her eyes at me. That is rude beyond belief! She also started 10 minutes behind schedule and didn't even give me a long foot rub. I saw my friend and the lady next to me receive much more TLC. She didn't cut my cuticles either. Mind you, I do this at home so they were probably in good shape but my baby toe could have used a cuticle trim as it's harder for me to cut the cuticles on my pinky toes. 

Would I return?
Most definitely not. I was very unimpressed with the experience."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I came to Tori's bakeshop with some friends and it was packed. The seating is first come first serve, which makes it slightly difficult with a large group. However, I used my awesome negotiation skills to ask a table of two if they could switch tables with my two friends so we could have their table that would fit up to 5 people. 

Once we all were seated we began to place our orders. To order you walk up to the bakery, wait in line and decide which goodies you would like to try. 

All of my friends said their lunches and/or desserts were fantastic!  Two of my friends had the item that looked like a pizza and they both said it was great! Another friend had a muffin and latte and she said it was really good too!

I ordered the cauliflower soup of the day and it was really good. I found it a little bit salty but the crackers that came with it were to die for. I also purchased a mocha latte and 6 desserts to take home and freeze. Well, one was for that evening. All of the baked goods at Tori's are vegan (lactose free).  In addition to this splendid news, half of the baked goods featured in the counter were also gluten free. This literally put me into dessert heaven. 

The cupcake that I tried the first night was a chocolate chip cupcake. The frosting tasted just like cookie dough batter. It was amazing! The cupcake was slightly dry but that could be because I left it in the fridge until the evening. 

The other desserts that I purchased (all from the gluten free selection) included a vanilla donut, a chocolate donut with sea salt (this was literally the best donut I have had since discovering I am gluten intolerant), a chocolate cupcake with a mini donut on top and lots of frosting, a lemon cupcake and an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. I can't wait to try them but I'm not sure when that will be. I'll keep you posted and will possibly update my review once I have thawed them out and enjoyed each one.

Would I return to Tori's bakeshop?  Definitely!  I might go to buy desserts to go for my birthday or something of that nature. I'm not sure I would plan an event there as it's really far away and it took most of my friends a long time to get there.

Food: 5 Stars
Restaurant: 4 Stars (they don't take reservations)"
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I had a really good experience at The Alley. My friend and I came here for a drink and it was a fantastic experience from beginning to end.

The ambiance in the restaurant is warm and cozy. The restaurant has a nice feeling and all of the employees are really friendly, helpful and kind.

Before I placed my order, I told the employee I was both gluten and lactose intolerant. The two employees working at the counter recommended I try the Brown Sugar Deerioca or the ginger sweet tea since I had a sore throat. 

I decided to order the Brown Sugar Deerioca beverage to enjoy at the restaurant and I ended up getting the Sweet Ginger Tea to-go. When I received the Brown Sugar Deerioca, it was presented in three beautiful layers. The dark coloured tapioca was prominent at the bottom of the cup and a rich caramel colour was above it with a creamy white colour on top.

I mixed the three layers together and will try my best to describe the amazing flavour of this drink. The tapioca was fresh, warm and chewy; I could tell it had just been cooked. The flavour of the brown sugar layer and the almond milk layer were fantastic! It tasted like a sugar syrup you would bake on the stove yet it also kind of reminded me of cotton candy. It made my mind think of a delicious caramel sauce. The flavour pallet of this bubble tea was beyond any type I have tried in the past. It was definitely an experience and I highly recommend you check it out too. 

Ginger Sweet Tea To-Go!
The sweet ginger tea tasted really good and definitely helped soothe my sore throat. If you're feeling a bit under the weather this would definitely help you. 

Now for the ICING on the CAKE!

My to-go drink had a special touch most restaurants do not have. My to-go cup was served with a deer sleeve that had a strap that allows guests to carry their beverage out of the store without burning their hands. The drink sleeve had a handle. It was the most adorable drink sleeve I have ever used and I hope more restaurants start implementing sleeves like this. It is very creative and innovative. To see what it looks like, find my photo. 

In Summary:
... I would definitely return to this bubble tea restaurant when in the area. 

Tip:
Make sure you get their loyalty card."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I came to Touro for the first time last weekend and had a good experience. My friends and I were seated at a table in the middle of a row with three sets of tables. 

When you first sit down you are told to go up and grab food/sides from the buffet tables. We went up to get our starters and I asked a waiter what food items I could eat since I am both lactose and gluten intolerant. The waiter called the chef who walked me through the entire buffet. To my surprise, there were lots of side dishes I could enjoy. One such dish was a Brazilian dish called, Farofa. I had never had this before and it looks like a grain but it is made with a wheat free product. It was really good and I will definitely try making it in the future at home.

When we flipped our cards to the green side to request meat, I felt like we were skipped over by the employees serving the meat. They kept approaching the tables on the end of our row and kept forgetting to visit our table in the middle of the row. I was late to join my friends (parking in this plaza is a nightmare on the weekend) and my friends had already started eating when I arrived and I was getting frustrated by the employees as they continued to overlook our table. I even tried flagging some of them down and it took about 30 minutes for some of them to notice us. I even asked our waitress to send them to our table and she wasn't successful at getting them to visit us.

With the above being said, the food was really good. The meats were scrumptious and I really enjoyed the Picanha steak. It tasted sweet and spicy. The seasoning was perfect and the steak was tender. However, I was disappointed that I didn't get to try all of the meats because the servers in the restaurant kept overlooking.  Considering I paid $70 fir my meal, I would have liked to try all of the meats. 

When it became time for dessert I was in heaven. One of my favourite desserts and digestive aid is pineapple. The employees walk around serving you grilled pineapple coated in brown sugar and cinnamon. It is to die for and something that made the entire meal come together nicely. 

During the weekend, Touro puts on a show and the show was okay. Once again, we were sitting too far away from it and they engaged with people sitting on the end tables and we were in the middle.

Allover it was a nice experience but I'm not sure I would go back on a weekend. I would possibly go back on a week night when it is less busy and only if we could get a table at either end of the row"
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I came here to celebrate my birthday with a bunch of friends. The restaurant was very inviting and good for big groups.  The only flaw was the food wasn't too great and the portions were very small. A lot of my friends and myself were disappointed with the beet salad appetizer; we wouldn't order it again if we were to revisit the restaurant. It didn't have that wow factor like it does at many other restaurants.  My friend who ordered the Puff pastry filled with seafood in spinach and parsley velouté sauce said it was really good. My other friend who ordered the Smoked salmon with red pepper coulis and avocado mousse said it was just okay. 

Next, let's talk about the entrees.
* Grilled Mahi Mahi, sweet pepper coulis, served with rice and seasonal vegetables.
- My friend who ordered this said it was really good. A+

* Grilled beef steak, scallop potatoes with grilled seasonal vegetables in green pepper cognac sauce
 - My friends who ordered this dish said it was good but the portion was just a little too small

* Pan seared veal loin with wild mushrooms and spinach risotto
 - I ordered this dish and the meat was very tender. This dish was also gluten and lactose free. This was one of the smallest entrees we received at Marcel's. It just came with the veal and a risotto. I would have liked to receive some sort of vegetable on the side. 

* Lamb stew with dried apricots, carrots, turnip and onion served with couscous
- My friend enjoyed this. This was also definitely the biggest portioned dish that we received

* Pearl barley risotto with winter vegetable
- My friend said this was good but the portion was incredibly small

The Desserts:
* Rum cake topped with fresh fruit 
- My friends who ordered this said it was really bad. They didn't like the texture of the dessert and wished they had ordered something else.

* Sorbet with Fresh Fruit:
- The sorbet was really good. However I really wanted a chocolate cake and this was the only lactose and gluten free dessert on the menu. If the owners are looking at this review, please add a chocolate tort to your menu. 

* Lemon pie with crispy meringue and raspberry coulis
- My friend said it was good

* Marcel's famous apple tart with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce
- This looked delicious. I didn't ask my friend what she thought but she ate it all so I'm pretty sure it was good. 

Service: 4 Stars: Our waiter was great!
Food: 2 stars: You need to start strong and finish strong. Marcel's could definitely improve some of the dishes and add vegetables or other sides to make the mains more complete. 

I have to give the restaurant two stars because according to Yelp two stars means you have experienced better.  I honestly would not go back."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I was really disappointed with my shopping experience at this location. Last year when I came to this location the employee who helped me was really knowledgable and helpful. This year the employees were really unhelpful and appeared as if they did not want to be working at the store.

When I first walked into the store, a lady kind of said hi to me using a really soft voice.  She was sitting in the area where customers try on shoes. I asked her if she worked for the store and she responded with, ""Yes"".

Then I told her about my feet and asked her what shoes I could wear. She started suggesting shoes that were in no way shape or form for a person who over pronates.  I told her those shoes wouldn't work and the manager stepped in to help her. 

The manager told me which shoes I could try. I told them my size and they didn't have my shoe size available in any of the suggested shoes. I asked them to bring me similar shoes so I could try them on as I am the hands on type and want to try something on before I buy it. The manager then told me I was wasting their time and should just purchase the shoe he recommended online. 

Are you kidding me??  The manager just said I was wasting their time???  At this point I didn't even want to shop here. I called Running Free, another store in the area and asked them if they had the shoe the manager at the Running Room suggested. Running Free said they had the shoe but I was feeling sick and didn't want to make the drive to the store. As a result, I ordered the shoes and paid for them at the Running Room. Looking back at the situation, I should have left and gone to the other store. 

Upon returning to the Running Room to pick up my shoe, I was dissatisfied with the service again. Tonight a different sales team was working on the floor but they did not offer any services that were better than the last time.  When I walked into the store I told the lady at the cash register that I was there to pick up my shoes. She came out with my shoes and did not give me the option to try on the shoes. Having not tried on the shoes in their store the first time, they should have offered me that service. It appeared they just wanted me to get in and out of the store as quickly as possible. 

Luckily I had tried on the shoes at Running Free but if I had not, I would not have known if the shoe was going to fit until I arrived home and tried them on. 

Will I return to the Running Room?  Never again
Will I go to Running Free?  Absolutely (while there the employees were very helpful and kind. I wish I bought my shoes there so I could support the employment of great employees versus people who hate customers and their job.)

My bill came to $175 and I don't believe anyone at the Running Room deserves any of the commission or profits from those shoes."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I came to this salon to get my hair done and I received the worst customer service ever!  They quoted me a two hour time frame and it took them five hours to complete my hair.  I purchased a voucher off of a deal site for $30.00. When I got there, they said they had to charge me an extra $60.00 to get my hair done. I think that is ridiculous because my hair is not even that long. Then they left me with hair dye stuck in my hair for over 2hours.  I've been dying my hair for years and know that is not right. I confronted the salon and they told me high quality dye can be left on the hair much longer. I actually know this is not true. The salon did not even put dye on the ends of my hair.  Next they moved me to the sink where they splashed water with hair dye into my eye. My eye began to burn and they told me this wasn't a big deal. They left my hair for over 30 minutes for the dye to Colour the tips of my hair which had not received Colour until this point. Now the dye had been on my hair more than 2.5hours. I was really annoyed because I was going to an event and needed to get my nails done and my hair should have been done at this point. When I told the salon about this, they told me it doesn't matter how long your hair takes but you will look good when you leave. I told them I still had to get my nails done and do my makeup. They said that doesn't matter as long as my hair looks good. Then a customer who appeared to be a relative of the stylist started yelling at me telling me it doesn't matter how long you are in the salon...  The point is you will leave looking fabulous. Okay... Well maybe her time isn't valuable but my time is and I had my afternoon planned accordingly to get everything done. This lady claimed she had been in the salon for 5 hours but she doesn't care because he hair looks good. 

First, the salon should have stopped this relative from yelling at me. Second she has no right to tell me I shouldn't care about my wasted time. When I was younger I would get a manicure, pedicure, dye, highlights and an up-do all done in 6 hours. I don't think I have unreasonable expectations. If you are quoted a certain amount of time they should not double the amount of time. That is unprofessional. While they had hair dye on my head for 2.5hours the stylist was serving other customers. This salon is really unprofessional and I do not recommend them at all. I was terrified my hair would fall out from leaving the product in this long. This is horrible service. 

The purpose of a deal site is to provide customers with exceptional service so they will become loyal customers. It seems Ruffles was just looking for a way to make money quickly without caring about the people walking through their front door. This is a shame considering how convenient the location is. I will never go here again! If anyone has a recommendation of a great place to get their hair dyed, styled and cut in the area please let me know.  My amazing stylist quit working where I used to go and I'm looking for a new salon. Ruffles is definitely not that place. Time to keep looking!"
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"This place is both known as the Toronto Acne Clinic and The Toronto Centre for Advanced Skin Repair. I started coming here in 2011 for my acne prone skin, which was pretty much under control from medication. The doctor told me the reason I break out is because I was using moisturizer on my skin. He told me I have to stop using moisturizer. So I stopped using moisturizer and my skin got extremely dry. The doctor told me this was normal and after going through a dry phase my skin would produce oil on it's own. I followed his advice for over a year. My skin began to look very scaly. It was so embarrassing to have skin that looked like a snake. I kept at it and he kept preaching for me not to use moisturizer. I used to have skin where everyone would complement me saying how youthful and radiant it looked. I just didn't like my few breakouts. 

After complaining about my newly horribly dry and embarrassing skin, he told me it would be okay for me to use moisturizer on the driest patches on my face. I did this and after two years I started using Cliniques toner and moisturizer in addition to the Ducray facewash that they sell at this clinic. 

The Ducray facewash is amazing and that is the only good thing that came out of this experience. It isn't too harsh on your skin and it removes dirt, oil and most of my foundation. I still use it today and you can also purchase it at the Main Drug Mart on the main level of the building. 

I knew something was still wrong with my skin before adding Cliniques products to my skin care regimen because every time I went for a facial I was told my skin was severely dehydrated and aging prematurely. I would then tell the technician that my dermatologist would not allow me to use moisturizers and the aesthetician would tell me that I must use moisturizer.

So now it's 2013 and I'm using the Clinique toner and moisturizer. My skin began to be a bit more hydrated but it still wasn't enough. I don't recommend the Clinique toner or yellow cream as they strip the skin of oils and kind of replace what it stripped from the skin. My skin felt slightly better but it was still dry. 

Today I'm still looking for my perfect skin care regimen. I almost have a solution for my severely dehydrated skin that is almost working but I would have been better off to have gone to Sephora where the staff are very knowledgeable on their skincare products. 

I am saddened that my skin has aged prematurely because this doctor recommended I don't use moisturizer. 

I don't recommend this clinic at all. They will ruin your skin. Now I have to use all these serums and so forth to make up for about 2 years of damage that could have been avoided if I went to a place where they could better advise me on my skin. 

If this also happened to you, you can try the following as I find it to be helping my skin.

Ducray facewash
First aid toner from Sephora
A serum - (there are so many to choose from; test a bunch and asks for samples to find the best one)
A moisturizer (there are many you can choose from. Something oil free would be good. I don't recommend Clinique for this)
Oil Free Sunscreen
Face Primer if wearing makeup

This is helping my skin but I have a lot of damage I now have to reverse.

I don't recommend this clinic at all. 

My skin type is combination (oily and normal) and severely dehydrated."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I came to Tori's bakeshop with some friends and it was packed. The seating is first come first serve, which makes it slightly difficult with a large group. However, I used my awesome negotiation skills to ask a table of two if they could switch tables with my two friends so we could have their table that would fit up to 5 people. 

Once we all were seated we began to place our orders. To order you walk up to the bakery, wait in line and decide which goodies you would like to try. 

All of my friends said their lunches and/or desserts were fantastic!  Two of my friends had the item that looked like a pizza and they both said it was great! Another friend had a muffin and latte and she said it was really good too!

I ordered the cauliflower soup of the day and it was really good. I found it a little bit salty but the crackers that came with it were to die for.

The other desserts that I purchased (all from the gluten free selection) included a vanilla donut, a chocolate donut with sea salt, a chocolate cupcake with a mini donut on top and lots of frosting, a lemon cupcake and an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. I wrapped all of these individually and froze them for later consumption. 

After trying all the desserts over the course of a month, here are my reviews:

April 5: I tried the chocolate donut and it was the best donut I have had since discovering I'm gluten and lactose intolerant.  I highly recommend this donut!

April 14: I tried the lemon cupcake and it was really good. It wasn't as good as the chocolate donut but it was really nice. The lemon flavour was fantastic but I found the cupcake a bit sweet for the lemon flavour. If it was less sweet, I may have liked it more. 

April 18: I tried the chocolate cupcake with the donut on top. The cupcake was just average (nothing special) but the mini donut on top was to die for. It reminded me how delicious their donuts are and that I'll have to go back and buy more to freeze once I try all of my goodies. 

April 29:  I just tried the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie and I really wasn't impressed. The cookie either had this awful taste or it was too sweet. I want to say the dough wasn't blended evenly during preparation and the oatmeal or whatever ""flour"" they used just had a horrible flavour. I definitely won't be buying this cookie again.

May 1: I tried the white donut with pink frosting. It was okay but the chocolate donut was much better. The donut had that weird flavour that the cookie had. It was really sweet during some bites and and not so great with others. 

The Verdict
I will definitely go back to purchase Tori's gluten free chocolate donut and the chocolate chip cupcake (the frosting was out of this world). My third choice would be the chocolate cupcake with a mini donut on top.

 Would I return to Tori's bakeshop?
Definitely!  I might go to buy desserts for my birthday or some other event. I'm not sure I would plan an event there since seating is first come first serve and it's a little out of the way. Allover I am very happy I discovered Tori's Bakeshop."
X-VOe5bzT9EJu_L_Bt0nLQ,"I recently won a $3000 dinner for 6 people hosted by City Gourmet and sponsored by Two Oceans Wines.

We just had the dinner last night and had an amazing experience. Chef Kai Zyganiuk and his lovely assistant Jen did an amazing job. They arrived at my friends house at 2:00pm to start cooking and setting up the dinner for us.

Myself and our other friends arrived at 5:00pm to begin the event. When I arrived Chef Kai was in the kitchen cooking our 6 course meal. He asked us what time we would like to begin eating. We choose 6pm so we could mingle and get ready for the evenings festivities. 

Each course was paired with the perfect Two Oceans Wine and Chef Kai accommodated everyone's food allergies. 

1st Course:
Our first course was a seared shrimp with a curried aioli, toasted sesame seeds and blackened lime. It tasted delicious and was paired with Two Oceans Pinot Grigio. The flavour combinations were so good, I definitely could have eaten more of the shrimp. The shrimp melted in our mouths and presented a unique flavour pallet when eaten with the aioli. I'll definitely be asking Chef Kai for the recipe. 

2nd Course:
The second course was a soup made with a white bean purée, charred chorizo sausage, chives and a toasted baguette (of course I didn't get to try the baguette since I'm both gluten and lactose intolerant but everyone said it was delicious). The soup tasted fantastic! It was spicy and flavourful. I really enjoyed the sausage within the soup. That is something I have never done before and it tasted exquisite. This course was paired with Two Oceans Sauvignon Blanc. The Sauvignon Blanc was smoother than most and definitely my favourite wine we tried during the main courses. (Hold tight for my review on the dessert wine). 

3rd Course:
The third Course was a delightful baby gem lettuce salad served with pickled red onions, warm pressed feta cheese (which looked amazing), toasted brioche, roasts almonds and vinaigrette. The salad had a nice woody flavour and I really enjoyed it.

4th Course:
The fourth course was an 11 hour braised berkshire pork seasoned with exotic spices and served with pearl cous cous (my course arrived with champ potatoes instead), red wine jus, onion jam, and micro basil. This course was very savoury. Chef Kai made extra and everyone had seconds. This dish with Two Oceans Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot. The Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot was medium bodied with a berry oak flavour. 

5th Course:
The fifth course was definitely the grand finale. Chef Kai prepared a seared prime beef tenderloin with a side of smoked Gouda cheese (I wish I wasn't lactose intolerant... hehe), tart cherries, champ potatoes, baby vegetables and natural jus. The steak was prepared perfectly. Chef Kai served it medium rare and it melted in our mouths. The tart cherries added a really unique flavour I had not experienced while eating a steak before. In fact, it was delightful. This main was paired with Two Oceans Shiraz. The Shiraz was fruity and medium bodied. It had notes of red cherries and vanilla. It's definitely worth trying if you enjoy red wine. 

6th Course:
The sixth course was a delicious dessert. Chef Kai prepared a medjool date cake for us with citrus and mint ice cream, baked lavender soil, soused berries and warm caramel sauce. My friends loved this course. I was served a bowl of soused berries and they were really good. This course was paired with Two Oceans Moscato. The Moscato was amazing and definitely my favourite wine of the night. I have a real sweet tooth and love sweet wines. If you enjoy sweet wines as well I highly recommend you try Two Oceans Moscato; it's sweet and goes down smooth. 

Chef Kai did an amazing job catering our Two Oceans get together. Chef Kai is extremely friendly and a master at what he does. He does an incredible job in the kitchen and can make due with whatever type of kitchen appliances you have. I highly recommend working with him and hope we can dine together again.

My friends and I are eager to try one of his cooking classes. Thank you for a wonderful evening Chef Kai and Two Oceans Wine."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"Oh God, I don't want to get yelled at for this review. 

Took my three siblings here today (8/22/11) after going to the Kidville CYME to get a treat on the way home. I've tried coming to Layers before, but it's been closed for the night on the nights I've stopped by. Maybe it's just me, but I could be wrong, but a place called ""Layers,"" has a tiered cake in their logo and bills themselves first as a bakery, would be thought to have a ton of bakery items right? A smorgasbord of cupcakes, cookies, pies, tarts, petits fours were what I was envisioning. Actually, this place is more like a soup, salad and sandwich shops that sells croissants, maybe 3 types of cupcakes,  some bar cookies and a few cakes. Everything is very brown and there doesn't seem to be a ton of variety and that was a let down. My 7 year old brother said, ""nothing looks good - it all looks the same."" :-/

My brother and sister each picked out a shortbread cookie that was dipped halfway in chocolate. I got a small cherry Italian soda. It came out to $6 and some change. We sat down in the nice chartreuse chairs (the place is very spacious and nicely furnished) while the kids ate their cookies off of their plates. After a few bites, my brother said, ""At first I thought this tasted really good and I could have eaten the whole thing, but now it doesn't taste so good."" I had a few bites - it was pretty tasteless. Some orange or lemon zest and some vanilla would do wonders to these cookies. When my sister brought the used plates up to the sandwich area, we were told that they didn't go here, but rather in the bins in the back. I don't necessarily mind putting my own plates up, but I'd like there to be better signage, and the bins placed next to the exit for convenience reasons. 

My soda came out and I was told I needed to stir it up really well. One problem - what was I supposed to stir it with? The cup was filled to the brim with ice (*_*) so the straw wasn't going to cut it. I found some napkins to cover the straw hole in the lid and shook it around, but that was still a wet mess as it leaked through the napkin. If I go to Starbucks and order a drink, they don't pump in chocolate syrup over ice and pour in coffee, and whatever else, then tell me I need to blend it myself so... I don't get why the drink wasn't mixed already. If they want us to mix our own drinks, a heat sealed cellophane lid, like the kind that come with boba drinks would be very useful in preventing leakage.  A Z-Cup Sealer would be ideal. 

My drink was good and that was the favorite item. The cookies were not so good and can be made better at home, from scratch. The entree food choices were ample and sounded tasty. The service was prompt and the space was very pleasant. I know that if I had known that there was mainly cafe type food, I would have saved a lot of trips to eat at Chili's and other restaurants on Eastern. I think Layers would do more business if they promoted themselves more as the cafe that they are, rather than as what I (and others) assumed was a wedding cake bakery. So yeah, meh, I've had better, but I'd be willing to give this place another shot."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"Went here today to buy some panties - Forever 21 and Wet Seal are the only places I buy underwear anyway, and heck, I was on the strip so off my sister and I went to check out the behemoth that is the Fashion Show Mall's Forever 21. 

I was here almost an hour and I wasn't able to check out even half of just the first floor. It was overwhelming. This place is ridiculous compared to Forever 21 in San Francisco - SF doesn't hold a candle to the selection here. I can't believe I used to pay $10 on BART to go all the way into the city to shop here after seeing the selection at this store. It's literally like dusty rose, cream and black exploded in the store. 

I literally came in to just buy some panties. There was a 3/$10 deal and a 5/$12. Obviously I chose the later deal, but I was really disappointed with the selection of undies. Forever 21 used to carry some really cute panties, but good lord, the selection here was horrific. Neon hot pink thongs, neon chartreuse thongs, or dusty rose undies. Bleh. Hideous colors. 

For whatever reason, almost all the panties were size ""S"" (5). *Sigh* I have a huge a**. I have to have a size ""L"" (7) for thongs and g-strings or ""XL"" for panties that would cover my booty cheeks. It was d- near impossible finding any size other than the ""s"" or ""all"" (whatever that means.)

There is a specific dress that I needed a necklace for and decided to check out the selection here. Apparently, the ""must-have"" motif this season is the owl. Everything was covered in owls. Seriously, did the band Owl City design all the jewelery this season? I really wasn't too impressed with the look or the quality of the necklaces, but ended up settling on a gold and green necklace for $6.50. I must say that it was difficult finding where exactly the jewelery was. Too many niches all over the place for certain accessories. The shear size of this place calls for signs pointing to where different departments are. 

I went to go buy my purchases and headed over to the registers at the back of the store. 3 employees were standing there and I finally asked if one of their registers were open. I was told ""No, you have to check-out at the front of the store."" *Sigh* Another trek to the other side of the store. 

There were a TON of employees all over the store and at the counter yet almost every registered has a ""closed, use next register"" sign in front of it. I took my 6 items up to the counter and was annoyed when I was told that I had four pairs of panties that were $2.80 and one pair that was $2.50 and that the pair of undies that was $2.50 disqualified me from the 5/$12 special. I had to run back and pick out a MORE EXPENSIVE pair of undies to qualify for the cheaper deal. Annoying. Extremely annoying. In the past, the sales clerk will just rescan a more expensive pair of undies so I still get the deal, yet get the cheaper pair that I want and the store makes more money. Wah. 

I might go back but I think I'll stick with Wet Seal for my pantie purchases in the future. Way too much stuff without enough signage and organization. Way too many staff members more concerned with breaks than providing service."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"Ever since the Mint Yelp event, I've been DYING to come back here but hadn't because of lack of somebody to come here with. My friends are unadventurous eaters and unfortunately, this is a place my family would never eat at because well... for example, my mom's favorite food is saltine crackers and milk.  Anything remotely spiced is shunned and I get a lecture about how I need to be normal and eat stuff the family will eat (read: bland and processed.) Zzzzz.

I've had the mind to walk down and just eat here by myself when I'm at school, but I'm afraid I'd gorge myself on the much talked about goat stew, the delicious gulab jamun and the KILLER tamarind sauce. Seriously, you know how there's that nasty tasting cake called ""better than sex cake?"" Well, if there's a food on this planet that should have the title of ""almost as good as sex,"" this tamarind sauce is the only one that could possibly be a contender - it's crazy delicious.

After volunteering at the Las Vegas Rescue Mission on 7/16/11, I needed to grab some food before work because I felt faint, thanks to some vegetable and fruit only fast that I was on. Being a non-vegan, looking for vegan food, I had only one place in mind to go - Mint. 

My sister waited outside while I walked in. After a few minutes of perusing the menu, I noticed that it was laid out differently than it was when I came for the Yelp event - it was much easier to find the vegetarian and vegan options. 

I'm supposed to eat only vegetables and fruit on this thing- no dairy, no meat, no nuts, no grains, but, dang it, I was in a hurry and after 5 days of eating dressing-free salads and drinking juiced cucumbers and carrots, I was dying for something filling and flavorful. The meat options all looked killer and I wouldn't mind eating... well anything on the menu. It all sounded great. I settled on potato and pea samosa and a half order of malai kofta with 10 spiciness, hold the rice and the naan. (Less than $10 total.) 

The service was good. I chatted with Smeet about school and work while I waited. He told me the kofta wasn't vegan. At that point, I didn't care. I'd settle for vegetarian for this meal. Friendly service anywhere is always good and in about 15-20 minutes, my food was in my hands and I was out the door. I basically ripped open the container and devoured half of the innards of one of the samosas while simultaneously changing for work in the car. I took the rest with me in to work and chowed down. 

Ummmm... the malai kofta was SO good. Maybe I was deliriously hungry or maybe it was just that good. I've been craving more of that kofta like crazy. It was spicy, but not overly so, and had the creamiest texture. It was delicious. How wonderful it is to have something spicy! The remainder of the samosa had the mint and  the ZOMG! tamarind sauce that Smeet included in little containers, poured over them. It was the best thing I'd eaten in almost a week. I wish I had ordered double the amount of food. 

Would I go back? YES. As of this writing, I have 8 more days to go on this Vegan thing and I have a feeling I'll hit up Mint at least two more times to grab some more delicious food before I'm done."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"I feel bad writing the first review, and a negative one at that. Here goes. 

So I went here yesterday (3/21/11) between the end of my last class and one of my performance rehearsals seeing as I had an hour and 45 minutes to spare. At 2:30 I headed across the street, with every intention of checking out Cafe Rio, but my kryptonite, the words ""Mediterranean food"" caught my eye. The pull was too strong, despite my aversion to the crappy strip mall it's in. 

I should have known, but against my better judgment, I went inside, even though there was a menu outside. I thought that couldn't be all the offerings - some salads and hamburgers. I thought there had to be a Mediterranean menu of some sort inside. There wasn't.

*Sigh* other than one older guy eating, I was the only customer in there. Bad sign. The owner, Maroun (like the color maroon) handed me a menu at the cash register. There was hummus, falafel, baba ganoush and dolmades. Yep, that's it, for the Mediterranean offerings. I didn't have the heart to leave, even though I really wanted to. 

I ordered a combination plate which was $5.40 including tax. It came with dolmades, hummus and some other dip that wasn't too tasty. The meal came out on a Styrofoam plate, well, three actually. One for the pita bread that I heard them microwave (cringe!!!) one for the dips and dolmades, and another for the... tomato slices and...dill pickle chips? Yep. Bizarre. I ate most of it, sans pickles and the other dip that tasted like cumin. 

The owner talked to me while I ordered, about school and Middle Eastern stuff. He asked me if I was Middle Eastern, a question I, and my sister, actually get somewhat frequently. For whatever reason, we get mistaken for Persian, even though if I was, I'd be the most Irish-looking Persian in existence - my sister, eh, more believable, thanks to the Indian in us. Anyway, the owner asked me if I was familiar with Middle Eastern music. I said ""not really, just Greek music."" He put in some super old Greek rembetika music and started telling me about when he lived over there. Then he started talking about me calling into his radio show he runs and yada yada yada. 

I asked him if they get a lot of students in, and the owner told me ""not yet."" Honestly, I know why this place isn't getting business - it doesn't have a consistent concept. The place has cans of pop, ice cream bars, and individual bags of chips for sale. It's sort of like - just a bunch of stuff they picked up from Costco with little Sharpied signs taped to shelving, indicating prices. Either they need to do Mediterranean food, or skip it. They're right next door to 7-11 so they need to do away with the chips, pop and candy. 

They need to redo the menu, and either go American or Mediterranean and serve real, HOT, entrees. Right now the menu/decor/concept is riding the fence between a conveince store and a restaurant. If this place is going to be successful, which it could be due to the location, they must remedy the offerings. I'd get rid of the disposable plates and silverware as well. This place could be good, but as is, despite the friendly owner, the food is just a miss. I was actually nauseous for 3 hours after I ate here. No bueno."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"Last night (2/4/11) a semi-truck jackknifed on Eastern & 215 so instead of meeting up with my group of girls at Revolution, it took me close to an hour to get down to the strip by taking St. Rose Pkwy to LV Blvd. The strip was jammed so I had to meet up with the group over at Rockhouse. I missed the pre-party :-( 

After passing 6 cop cars who were blocking the entrance of Imperial Palace, I was able to get in via Harrah's and into the Imperial Palace parking lot. Ummm... smallest parking garage ever - every spot was taken, except on the top (4th) floor. Unfortunately, the spots nearest the elevator were reserved for ""supervisor of the quarter"" and a bunch of other crazy stuff. I had to drive out of the garage, backward, to find a spot somewhere else on the floor. 

Ugh, so after finally getting a spot, navigating the very depressing, ""Imperial Palace,"" which is neither imperial, nor a palace, I got to wait outside with Dustin. We waited a good half hour outside for the rest of our friends to show up. It was $5 for girls, $10 for guys to get in, yet our friend Catherine's boyfriend had bought a table, so we just had to wait for them to arrive so we could all get in for free.

Outside the door....ummmm a dime was working the front area. He was wearing a scarf - much better looking than a lot of the door people at the fancier clubs. Although our group was 2/3 guys, we were let in immediately. Upon entering, we were visually accosted by two extremely obese girls in the cage dancing. Woah. Anyway, we were seated at a table right near the dance floor. The hostesses look kinda scary - tons of tats, tattered jean shorts, ripped up belly top t-shirts, they look rough.

The music is WONDERFUL. Mostly hip-hop/rap/top 40. None of that horrific trance, techno, electronica that so many Vegas clubs play. The place was poppin' and it's fun to dance when everybody's having a good time. 

I have never sweated so much at a club before . For February, this place was cookin'. My forearms were sweaty, my makeup was probably busted (thank God it was dark) and sweat was pouring down my back. I was getting dizzy dancing in the cage because of the heat and had to take a water break and step outside for a bit. Never have I experienced that, but hey, when the music's good, you dance!

The clientele is kinda sketch. The clientele aren't the average club chicks dressed to the nines and crippled by their sky-high heels and guys in sport coats and dark washed jeans trying to introduce you to their ""business partners."" You're more likely to see girls in jeans rather than bubble dresses, but it's okay. The guys are mostly in jeans and a casual shirt. Oh lordy, there was one guy who was in our group - I think he was a friend of a friend. He was dressed in a suit because he had come from work. Ummm... melt. Too bad all these dimes are seeing people. He definitely stood out in the sea of casual dressed people last night.

My one complaint is that the bouncers let girls without a table dance in our area - ummmm not cool. One bouncer was also on my friends the whole night because they kept taking off their shoes while dancing on the couches at the table because their feet hurt.

The music is hands down the best at any of the clubs and I had a great time. I'd for sure go back!"
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"When you're in Vegas and hear the term ""Ghetto club"" being thrown around, don't worry, it just means the music is good and the people aren't pretentious fools, trying to play rich, in the only suit they own from Burlington, with a bunch of cash they've saved up from their minimum wage job for four months, eating nothing but top ramen and spam, so they can buy bottle service for a night. 

Whew! Okay. So after the horrific lameness of XS, my friends and I headed on over to JET. (12/13/10) There were huge lines but my friend Jen just walked up next to the line in front of a bouncer and said, ""Hey, we have local ID's, can you get us in right now. We're not waiting in line."" He said yeah and we were in. Literally, 3 minutes, between the time we walked up and the time we were inside. This is how a club is supposed to be run. 

When we got inside, you're supposed to either have a ticket or a VIP card or you gotta pay up. We had neither card and weren't going to pay. The bouncer said he'd take care of us and he walked outside, got three tickets and let us on through. Thank you!

This place was PACKED, as in, no room to move. The music was good but I really dislike the setup of the place. I never saw any other rooms but the main floor. The main floor is a rectangle within a rectangle, the outside being the two bars, the inside the dance floor and in the very center, a raised rectangle with two stripper poles. Because the dance floor is surrounded by stuff, there are constantly people pushing through to get to the other side. This is a really poor design. The two stripper poles in the center need to be removed so there's more dance room. 

Oh, I forgot something. There was this creepy fat, old guy standing in line outside by himself. My friend Jen got ticked off because he was filming us with his cellphone and oogling us (again, I dress really conservative, throw a head covering on me and I would be Saudi Arabia approved. ) Inside, I saw him again and he was taking more cellphone videos so I walked up to a bouncer and within minutes, it was taken care of. THANK YOU! See, this is what bouncers are supposed to do. When we were walking inside, my friend Esther told a bouncer about the two separate guys harassing us  to go with them to get bottle service and they took care of it right away.

Onto the music. It was bumping. They played... wait for it... MAC DRE's ""Feelin' Myself"". Oh LORD, I died and went to heaven. They played Too $hort, E-40. Heaven. My friend Jen always tells me I ""dance like a black girl"" and I take this as a compliment. When they play songs from the Bay, of course I'll get hyphy. 

Unfortunately, while we were dancing, some weirdo came up to Esther, who is 6'2 without her heels on and has a killer body and acted like he was going say something to her - nope, he freakin stuck his tongue in her ear. WTF?! She started screaming and I pulled her away asap. We couldn't find him or else we would have had him thrown out. Oh, and when we were crossing the dance floor, the strobe light came on and somebody accidentally hit Jen in the face. Yikes! 

We agreed we'd go back next week because, despite the two above mentioned things, this club is poppin' and it's fun. You can have your trance techno lounges Mr. Wynn, I'm going to get down out here."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"After work last night (7/24/11) my friend Jerry J. mentioned that we should go grab some food. We both drove to our prospective homes and then he came to pick me up about 5 seconds later. Hmmm... where to go? He suggested Greek food because:
#1 he knows I like Greek food.
#2 he had never tried Mediterranean food (!!!)
#3 he's scoping the food out and if he didn't like it, our possible trip in December might not happen.

Let it be known, that just like the Mexican food scene in Vegas, with small exceptions, the Greek food scene in Vegas is limited to crap kai Kronos gyros. I wasn't sure where we could even get any sort of Mediterranean food at 11 PM. I remembered Laziza was close to our houses, so we might as well check it out. After he drove around the parking lot and down the street a few times (he wasn't sure whether he was going to try the food or not... he's VERY picky) he finally went for it and we went inside.

Umm... WTF?! WHY don't clubs in Vegas play music like this? They had the most FABULOUS hyphy/rap/hip-hop mix BLASTING when we walked inside. On a Sunday night, I dare say the music is better than even Vanity. Heaven. Pure Heaven. I walked up to a guy sitting in a little room off to the left and asked him if the place was open for dinner and he quickly jumped up,  and grabbed us menus and led us to a booth by the bar. 

It took a LONG time for a waiter to come over and take our order. Because I was asked to just pick whatever off the menu for both of us, I ordered the Mezze sampler for us to share ($20) and a gyro with fries ($9) for Jerry to try. It took a long time for the food to come out, the sampler coming out about 10 minutes after the gyro. Jerry, being like a fish out of water at this place asked me what everything was on the plate - ""that's shaved meat, that's pita bread, that's the cucumber sauce I was telling you about."" ""What's this sauce?"" ""Jerry... that's ketchup for your fries."" Hehehe. 

He said he really liked the gyro (thank God) but I can't comment on it as I didn't try it, but the falafel was the best I had ever had. Usually, falafel is dense and heavy, but these, when hot, were light and crispy. Yum! The tabouli was forgettable, the baba ghanoush, which is another dish I usually dislike, was very good. There were no dolmades, which were mentioned in the description, but rather two types of hummus, one being very smoky, and neither being that good. As well, the labnah is better at home and should have been served cold - it was too much like a runny dip in its warm form.  Everything on the plate, sans falafel and baba ghanoush is better tasting at home for sure. 

The atmosphere is great and if I could give this place 200 stars for the music, I would. I was dancing around in my seat and so was everybody else. Unfortunately, nobody was really on the dance floor, and I wasn't going to dance all by myself in a restaurant. I for sure want to come back with some friends just to grab a drink and dance. 

A mezze sampler that was missing the dolmades, a gyro, a diet coke, two waters + $7 tip came out to... $41. Ridiculous! The service was way too slow and should step up their game. The mezze needs to come down in price but I have to give 4 stars because I was going crazy with the great music and atmosphere. Definitely will be coming back."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"My 700th Yelp review! 

I graduated from UNLV Fall of '12 as a transfer student from Oklahoma State University exactly one year ago to the day. I started Spring of '11. If you have the money, I implore you to choose to attend a different school. 

I transfered because my parents couldn't afford the $26k/ year out-of-state tuition they were paying for me to attend OSU. I had about 68 credit hours, including about 18 hours of senior level classes. I also had CLEP credit for English I & II. CLEP is a nationally recognized test that allows you to test out of college level courses.

Well after OSU I did some CC classes in California. Italian, Biology... Just random classes that I thought were interesting. I had about 40 credit hours of cc classes. 

Guess how many credits from OSU were accepted by UNLV, a school that isn't ranked anywhere near OSU? ZERO. They accepted ZERO credit hours from a great state university, and accepted nearly everything from the cc. Think about that... 

Apart from the hotel college, which I had to take 4 classes in because I was double majoring in dietetics and journalism, this school is a joke. I was at UNLV for two full years and didn't buy a single book my entire last year. And I still made the dean's list. Yeah. I told my professor that the 400 level courses were easier than my 100 level courses at OSU - and I wasn't being facetious. There are a handful of good teachers but for the most part, if you show up and participate, you're looked at like the golden rock star child of the class. 

I was heavily involved in student life. I was a two term, elected senator for the College of Health Sciences and chaired the rules and ethics committee as well as vice chaired the ways and means committee which oversaw a budget of $1.2+ million dollars in student funds. Because of my position, I was consistently present at Nevada Board of Regents meetings, fighting against tuition increases, to no avail. The top level administrators are lining their own pockets while cutting classes. Shameful.

This place runs like a zoo. Nobody has any idea what they're doing. I had to speak before the Board of Regents to complain about the hassle I was going through to get my CLEP credit recognized by the university so that I could graduate. Luckily the press was there and I got my paperwork signed off on. 

You have to pay around $75 for a graduation check. It supposedly is for the counselors to verify that you have met all your requirements for graduation and can apply to graduate. I did the mandatory check, graduated and when I hadn't received my diploma by March, I called the school and they told me I hadn't graduated because I didn't take English II. (Which I had CLEP credit and a signed waiver from the provost of UNLV that had been turned in months prior to graduation.) 

This didn't just happen to me. It happened to my sister and multiple friends - and we all graduated in different semesters in different majors. The graduation check is just a way to scam another $75 out of you. 

Luckily I keep amazing records and marched down and demanded they fix their errors. They didn't contact me to say I was missing a credit, after I graduated, I had to contact them to see where my diploma was. They straightened it out because of my record keeping. Surprise surprise. I did graduate. 

Good riddance."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"EFF this location! My Gawd... Burger King has better waiters than this location, and that's saying something, because Burger King doesn't have waiters. 

I've been to this specific location about 10 times and I freakin' loathe it. My sister asks, ""Rachel, what do you have against Chili's?"" I have nothing against Chili's, it's just this Chili's, along with the one off of Eastern in Henderson that makes a vein pop out of my forehead in rage. The service is horrific. Seriously, what's with this ""helper"" bs that Chili's has started? It's ridiculous because neither waiter asks you if you need anything; they just assume the other one has it covered, so you receive no service, rather than twice the service. 

I went here today, 2/13/11 for lunch with my sister and cousin. Our waitress, Ashlie, and her helper who never introduced herself or checked on us (black, pregnant lady) was good at first. I always order the unlimited soup and salad and every time I ask for my salad to come out with the chips, because I never eat the chips, it comes out after the chips are empty. Without fail, the waiters have NEVER given me my salad along with the chips, except today. Wow. Amazing! Jesus must be coming back soon or something because this NEVER happens. 

Well I guess Jesus sent out a rain check for his second coming because after that, the service went downhill. Our waitress ignored us the entire time. She'd ask other tables if they needed anything, but would breeze past our table, clearly avoiding us. Did we want drinks to refresh our palates? Well, we were SOL because Ashlie was for dang sure not going to get us more drinks. She took my sister's cup to ""get her a refill"" and never brought it back, let alone came back to our table, so my sister went the rest of the meal without a drink. We were never able to flag down our waitress or her helper to remedy the situation. 

While eating, some waitress was complaining about how messy this Chili's was, and asked my sister to move the chair next to her so she could sweep under it. Ummmm... we're eating, how about coming back after we're done eating to sweep the floor? Just a thought. 

When it was time to go, or more, it obviously was time to go because Ashlie threw down the check and walked off telling us ""no hurry,"" it took 15 minutes to get my cousin's debit card back. My cousin had a full plate of chicken crispers and fries and Ashlie piled a bunch of empty salad plates on top of the plate full of food, said she was going to go take it to the kitchen and process the check. Funny. We might have wanted a to-go box, but I guess as the waitress it's safer to assume and just toss it all out, rather than ask the customer what they wanted. She went back to the kitchen, and chatted with other waitresses in the entrance of the kitchen, then was lounging on the hostess podium while chatting with the helper server. She walked past my sister, threw my sister the side eye, put her pointer finger in the air and said, ""hold on"" and breezed on past our table to wait on another table. GEEZE, just give us the debit card back! She plunked it down and walked off. My sister made sure to write a big, fat ""NONE"" on the tip line. 

I'm sick of waiters thinking that young customers means no tip. Actually, no service means no tip. Her tip went from a few bucks, to one buck, to NONE real quick. EFF THIS LOCATION!!!"
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"Went here on Saturday, January 22, 2011 as the first of the four clubs I stopped in at that night. If there were more (not gross) people there, this place would get a 4-5 star.

So my friend Jen S. had a coworker who was having a birthday party, and I was her +1. She had a birthday dinner that I decided to skip because it was at a Cheesecake Factory in Summerlin and I didn't want to drive all that way then pay to have dinner with somebody I didn't know. The birthday girl's dad bought a suite at the Luxor so we were supposed to all meet at Luxor before heading on out to Haze where she supposedly had a table (she didn't, but that's another story.)

Fast-forward to 10:00, I was at the Luxor, walkin around, waiting for everybody to show up. A club promoter gave me a VIP pass to Cathouse and told me there was free champagne for ladies until 1 AM. That's pretty unheard of, usually a free drink or open bar is only until 11:00 or Midnight. 

At around 10:45, Jen showed up and told me the group was still at Cheesecake Factory. Umm... wtf? We didn't want to continue to chill in the lobby, so we got another Cathouse pass (and a bunch for LAX too) and headed on over.

We waited about 5 seconds to get in. There wasn't a line at all. We went up the stairs and... wow, this place is really gorgeous! I would never have thought the Luxor would have such a pretty club. It's like, what I think the decorators at Tryst were imagining, but failed to capture. There's tons of framed, black and white, pictures lining the walls of 1800's-1920's burlesque dancers and women in lingerie. It doesn't look trashy at all, actually. The place looks sort of like Haunted Mansion, minus the Haunted part. 

At the top of the stairs, there's a gorgeous red chaise lounge that you can sit on and have your friend take your picture. Do this!

Once you walk in, apparently, depending where you walk in, you'll be in a very pretty hookah lounge. I can't believe how pretty the tables are - much better than any of the clubs I've experienced bottle service at (Haze, XS, Tao.) Oh, and it doesn't smell like smoke, suprisingly.

Jen and I thought the hookah lounge was all there was. Nope, there is an enterance to the club through the hookah lounge and a hallway. There are two stages for people to dance on within the dance floor. Unfortunately, two morbidly obese girls in jeans and $1 tube tops were shaking it on the stage that has rails. Bleh. There weren't many people dancing, and the ones who were, were kinda gross. Hopefully, it was just an off night. 

We got our free champagne - they give you a lot, but in a plastic cup. Hehehe. I danced on one of the little stage by myself for a bit, unfortunately, I wore stupid fancy shoes, covered in faux diamonds and stayed on with a black ribbon around my ankles. It was way too slick in the shoes I unfortunately donned that night. 

When we got a text from the rest of the group saying they were finally at the suite, we left to go upstairs. We were there a total of about 20-30 minutes. 

If there were more people on the dance floor (it was dead because it just opened) and there was more ""refined"" people (not yokels in jeans) there, I'd give this place 4-5 stars. 

Oh, and after the debacle at Haze with them not having a table, we got a call at 2 AM from the group telling us they got bottle service at Cathouse but Jen and I each went home instead."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"""Not Mexican and not Chinese."" Those were the parameters set by Beau S. when he asked me to pick a restaurant for a ""late lunch/early dinner"" yesterday  (4/13/11) before I had to head to work.  Somehow, we ended up at Mesa, which, according to Beau, isn't Mexican, it's Tex-Mex, which is just ""spicy American food."" 

Upon walking in, it sorta looks like Guy Fieri had free reign to liberally apply as many ""flame"" touches as possible - from the sconces to the ceiling, there were flames...and cowhide backed chairs, and toile backed chairs, and rainbow tea jars, and various other curious design choices throughout the restaurant. 

When seated, the waiter asked if I would like anything to drink. I said ""water, no lemon please"" and he walked off. Apparently it didn't matter if Beau wanted anything to drink, because he, by default, would get what I was getting, regardless of what he wanted. Never mind that he was the one paying.

We were given at least 5 menus between the two of us. I couldn't decide if I should have the spicy beef tenderloin tartare appetizer or the barbecued lamb cobb salad. I decided to have my second cobb salad of the day so I went with that. Beau went with the spicy chicken and sweet potato hash. 

Being a native Texan, and therefor quite familiar with Tex- Mex cuisine, I found it curious that a restaurant that billed itself as ""Tex-Mex"" had two semi-Tex-Mex offerings on the lunch menu: Tacos and a chile relleno. All other offerings may have the inclusion of ""New Mexican spice blend"" (whatever that is) or a green chile sauce atop American fare but that's kinda... not really Tex-Mex. 

Our waiter delivered us a bread basket containing the following:
-2 slices of jalapeño French bread.
-1 blue and yellow corn muffin. (The blue corn part had the consistency of Moon Sand and fell apart when I picked it up.)
-2 slices of (Pepperidge Farm) raisin bread. (Yeah, I have no idea what that's about.) 

When the waiter brought out the food, he accidentally stepped on my foot and about had a heart attack, thinking I was one of those money hungry crazies that threaten to sue if so much as an eyelash is found on their napkin. It really wasn't that big of a deal and didn't even hurt. No biggie, but I guess he had no way of knowing I wasn't going to demand his termination to the manager for the gaffe. 

My salad was good. Not $17 dollars good, but tasty none-the-less. The lamb was perfectly rare, just how I like it. The frisée definitely needed to be ripped up because the pieces were huge and I looked like The Beast, from Beauty and the Beast, when he was trying to learn to use a spoon, when I was trying to wrap my mouth around my fork filled with this mini frisée tree. Beau's hash looked like baby vomit on the plate once he deconstructed it and picked out the chicken. He left the sweet potato on the plate because he said it was too sweet. 

After spending most of the time talking about the bizarre documentaries we watch on Netflix, it was time to go. When the waiter came with the bill, I told him there was no way we were paying after he assulted me by stepping on my foot. (haha) He said if that was the case that he would need to finish the job. I like it when waiters can play along like that. Beau took care of the bill and we left. 

Was the food good? Yeah. But there's no way that it's worth the prices they're charging. It was nice to try but it's no where I'd be tripping over myself to go back to."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"I went here last night (Friday 12/10/10) with two friends (the same friends I've been going to all the clubs with recently!) We showed up at like... 9:50 and I think the club opened at 10:30 so again, being on the guest list (free entry!) and being there so early meant we had a very empty club at our disposal. 

Unlike Tryst, the club goers here are 95% under the age of 35. While waiting in line, some guys in the general admission line - a Staten Island guido who thought he was all business on his cell (that he wasn't even talking into, just had it up to his ear for half an hour... frontin' B****, puuuuhleeze.) some guy pushing 40, in what looked like pajamas, and the guido's dad or grandpa. The old guy said the guido was his grandson, the guido said the old guy was his dad, so who knows.This old guy turns to us to tell us ""my grandson is a playboy. He always has ladies on him."" HAHAHA. If your dad has to talk you up to girls, you are everything but whatever he's trying to say you are. Those guys ended up buying bottle service (such tools; the club makes so much bank on these superficial b****es) and we steered clear of them. 

It's December. It is not exactly warm outside. Luckily, staff took note and there were a ton of heaters all along the pool. What wasn't around the pool? PEOPLE! We took tons of pictures on the chaises lounges with other girls from the club. We posed with the stripper pole outside, which had a funky Thai roof on it. They have them in the pool that spurt water and look like a wet slip away from a bashed open skull. 

The ""club"" is gorgeous but has a massive design flaw - there really isn't a central dance floor. People just sorta dance around the pool, which, in the middle of Fall/early Winter, the flaws scream. On one side of a pool is an entrance where a bar and VIP couches are and the other side is an outdoor room with craps, roulette, etc. What does this mean when the club is at maybe 2% capacity? It means that the sexes are split like it's a middle school dance - guys are gambling or sitting at their tables, and girls are standing around like cattle taking pictures. Nobody was really dancing. If the club wants bank, it would be smart to make a centralized dance floor so that everybody can peacock and spend stupid amounts of money on booze to impress people they'll never see again. 

Although I didn't pay a cover, two guys came up to me to chat. They told me they were down a bunch of cash after a drink + the cover charge. $40 cover for guys? Wow. During this economy, the clubs must like to stay empty when there's not a celeb in sight to jack up entrance prices. They also told me their vodkas were like... $20-$30 EACH. WTF?! They were lamenting how they couldn't get bottle service and how it would have been a better deal because the drinks were so expensive here. Oh well. When a guy came up to my friends and me, and offered to buy us all a drink, that surprised me because, well, that's like $100 bucks. we turned it down because he came up to us right as we all agreed to leave at 12:45. 

If you want cheaper drinks, there are girls giving out free cranberry apple something-or-rather shots in exchange for $1 tips. I have a feeling that there is absolutely no alcohol in them because they tasted like... cough syrup minus the corn syrup. Some guy bought us a round of shots but I gave mine to my friend because, well, I had a shot already and they were nasty! 

The music was decent, I really have no complaints. Not my style but it was still enjoyable. 

Overall, in the winter, Surrender is a solid three stars."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"In general, I have a rule about not reviewing churches. There's a specifically Biblical reason why I do not (1 Corinthians 6, Matthew 18:15-17) wish to ""review"" sermons or specific doctrine, so I will not be delving into that here today. 

I should start off by mentioning that I am not Orthodox, I am a protestant, although I'm very familiar with it because members of my family have been Orthodox. 

If you're coming here and are not familiar with these types of services, I'd suggest doing a tiny bit of research just so you don't feel lost, regardless of whether or not you're planning to participate. If you're Catholic or Episcopal, the services are nearly identical, only more kissing of the priest's rings, the Bible and (what's super verboten for Protestants like me) genuflecting and kissing statuary. Just remember, you're not required to do any of this, nor is anybody even going to bat an eyelash here if you don't. 

For me, I feel like I blend in enough if I do the sign of the cross along with everyone else (trust me, in the 3 hours that I was there, I think we ended up doing this about 8,000 times) and I'm fine reciting the Lord's Prayer. Anything else, don't worry about it, if it's not your thing. 

Like other Orthodox services, this church has two services in the morning that don't have a definitive ""end."" The second one starts as the second service finishes. 

Orthos (early service that starts at 8:45 AM) is just the preparation service where there is a reading while communion is set up. There was maybe 12 people when I showed up a few weeks ago. Some people only come to this service. Half of the orthos is in Greek, half in English. 

Liturgy (second service starts at 10 AM) is where everybody shows up. For the sake of not being rude, show up on time. It gets pretty full in here during this time as all of the kids and babies show up to take communion before being shuffled off to their Sunday school class. This was legitimately 99% in English. 

If you've been baptized in the Orthodox church (not Catholic, Episcopal, Protestant, etc) you're allowed to take communion here. There's no way for them to check, so it's really on you what you want to do. I don't subscribe to Orthodox views on the Bible, so I choose to forego taking communion when I'm at Orthodox services, but that's just me. If you're going to take it, make sure to keep your eye on the line because I sat up on the chairs, rather than the pew, and I'm pretty sure nobody even motioned to our section that it was time for us to go up. 

I can say that the service I attended had a really good message - it wasn't a feel good type thing, it was about how entitled we are today and only go to God when we're up a creek. I can say I genuinely enjoyed that part. 

At the end of the service, all the bread that wasn't used in communion is given to the congregation. Regardless of if you've been baptized or not at all, everyone is allowed to go up and receive some. I was surprised that the priest asked me my name and welcomed me to the church. I didn't realize he even noticed me or knew that I was new because there was easily more than 300 people at the service. That was a positive experience. 

I should add that this church is SO gorgeous. I should admit that I loved the fact that it's covered in pictures of the saints because I turned it into a game to check how well I could read Greek during parts of the service (easy, easy.) 

 There's a mix of Orthodox, Greek Orthodox and Coptic Christians who attend here. If that's your thing, I definitely would suggest paying a visit to this church."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"Went here a couple nights ago on a date (3/5/11) to go see ""Take Me Home Tonight."" Living Social had a coupon for 2 tickets for $9 deal, and this theater accepted that coupon so this is how we ended up there. Anyway... 

So my date picked me up and drove me directly to this place for this first date. Now, this is different from other dates I've been on because I really don't know a ton about this person, making a ""straight to the movies"" date kinda awkward because we're practically strangers. We got up to the ticket counter, yada yada yada, the whole ticket thing went off without a hitch. It was great that there was literally no line whatsoever, which kept awkward chit-chat, which, prior to this date, I'd never experienced, to a minimum. 

We got inside in about 3 seconds, and he asked me if I wanted anything from the concession stand. ""Eh. I'm  fine; but if you want something, I don't have a problem with you getting something for yourself.""  He said he wasn't going to buy anything because ""he didn't want to smell like popcorn when we made out later."" I'm unsure if the word that best describes how I felt was ""dumbfounded"" or ""offended"" by his assumption, but I said nothing as we headed on into the movie. 

Walking into the theater, my date exclaimed that it was ""so small, I (he) feel as if all these people are in my (his) living room."" The theater was really tiny, especially for a Regal Theater. There was a huge aisle right in the center for, say, about 25 Rascal scooters. It seemed like a lot of wasted space, but it didn't detract from the ""experience."" 

During the previews, my date went to go get us each a drink and came back with a 3,000 oz. Diet Coke for himself and a bottle of Dasani for me. Leaning over, he said, ""save that water bottle. I want to keep the bottle of the most expensive bottled water I've ever paid for."" I don't know how much it cost, but judging from that statement, I'll assume the concession stand was moderately pricey. If I wasn't feeling uncomfortable before that statement, I definitely was afterward.

One thing that took my mind off my date was the combination of hellaciously loud previews that needed turned down, stat, interspersed with the sounds of Justin Bieber in the next theater over. Don't get me wrong, I love JB, but I don't want to hear ""Somebody to Love"" when I'm trying to watch another show. Luckily, there were only a few times during the actual movie that I could hear JB, but regardless, they need to either turn the sound down, or pad the walls. 

The movie was great. The 3-year-old kid sitting two chairs to my left, was not so great. Walking, talking, busting a bottle of water on the floor, crying... the kid was pissing everybody off in the theater. People were turning around, giving the parents the side eye, and my date told me to ""go take care of that"" but I just sat there taking it all in, until the dad took the kid outside for a few minutes. Theaters need a rule that if it's not a children's show, kids under, say 5 years old, may not be in the theater. It's unfair to everybody who spent ~$15/ticket and left their kids at home to have their outing ruined by two entitled troglodytes.

Thanks to me being quite off-put at some of the things my date had said, I'm sure my date could sense that I was not putting out so much as a handshake, let alone a kiss, at any point during the date. After the movie was finished, he drove me home, I thanked him for the movie, and that was that. As for my experience with strictly the theater, I may go back, if I were in the area, because it's a bit far from my house. Overall, it's a decent theater and has enough things ""right"" with it, that it deserves a solid 3 stars."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"I wish Yelp had a box to check under ""Best Nights"" labeled ""NEV"" for ""Never.""  XS is excessively lame. 

Want to know what XS looks like? Um, it's basically Tryst with more tables and stripper poles. Want to know what music they play? Um, crap. Want to know why people rate this place 5 stars? Because they're insane. Seriously, just because XS' marketing and PR departments have done a great job hyping this s*** hole up, does not make it five stars. Ok, so you went to the ""happenin' club"" that title does not mean the experience was five stars.

I got here at 9:38 PM yesterday (12/13/10) before they ever even had the ropes out to form lines. I was on the guest list so a bouncer comes up to me and says, ""Hey are you on the guest list."" ""Yeah I am."" ""Okay, well you need to wait up against the wall until we can get the lines formed."" YAWN. Starting at 10 we lined up. 5 minutes later, some guy comes up to my two friends and me and asks if we would be in his group because he bought bottle service and they weren't going to let their party in because he had 5 more guys than girls and they needed an even number. We said ok when he told us we wouldn't have to wait in line.

One word of advice, don't do strangers at a club any favors. Clubs are not the place to let your compassion, bleeding heart or decency shine through. 

We ended up having to wait until 10:38 with this fool and his table of TWENTY THREE f-ing people to get in while the gen. admission line was flying in. This guy who bought bottle service had the audacity to tell us we were going to have to pay $10 each to get in as a tip for the host. F THAT;  we're not even sitting at your table. We're doing you a favor. I was like, ""I'm not tipping a host and I'm not paying a penny to get in here since I'm already on the guest list (free admission.)"" I couldn't go wait in the other line because by that time it was 8 miles deep. 

Oh, word of advice. This isn't a freaking speakeasy, it's a corporate-owned club. There's no reason you should feel the need to bribe (tip) anybody just to get into the club on top of your entrance fee (if you have to pay a cover.) It's not exclusive and no paid employee is doing you any favors getting you into this high priced bar.

After getting our ID's checked 50 times, my friend Esther got out of line to talk to a bouncer about the f***ery we were experiencing and how we needed to get in right now. The second she was around the corner, amazing! The people at the front let us in. My friend Jen and I were frantically calling Esther when we were corralled inside only to be stopped by another bouncer to ID us and stamp our hands. I told the bouncer we had one more person coming (she was standing outside by that time) and he said she'd have to wait in line. I opened the door and started yelling her name and told her to come in. She was behind all the ropes and two bouncers were trying to get her to go to the back of the line when I yelled, ""She's coming in now and she's not waiting in line."" She lifted up the ropes and walked on through just as a bouncer was running up on her. The audacity of these bouncers is unreal.

We get in the club and it's horrible. Lame music, the pool is empty but there is some chick dancing across from us, past the balcony and empty pool, on top of the pool bar, by herself. Random. Very few people were in the club; funny since the lines were at a standstill outside. After 12- 15 minutes of this lame nonsense. My friends and I decided to head on over to JET, even though we weren't on any guest list. 

I will NEVER ever go back to XS. When Marquee opens up (for general admission,) this place will be a ghost town. XS needs to realize that bouncers are for keeping things under control, not a place to let their $10 an hour a**es let their God complexes run wild."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"Disclaimer: I got two tickets for free because I donated blood. They were about to expire on July 31st, and seeing how yesterday (7/25/11) was my only night off, it was as good a time as any to use up the ticket. My sister also had two free tickets so we were trying to get her boyfriend and one of my friends to come. No dice. 

Okay, I didn't have high expectations either, but when my friends were like, ""eh... don't waste your time"" I just thought it was because they wanted to chill at home. I should have listened!

We got to Planet Hollywood and were told we could ""upgrade"" to VIP for $22 a person. Don't do it. The map makes it look as if the theater is humongous and the general admission seats are in the north 40. Don't worry, the theater seats less than 450 people, and it's stadium seating - you will be able to see from every seat. 

I LOVED that the usher girls volunteered the fact that the first row of the bottom portion of general admission seating is crap. When we sat in the seats anyway, we noticed it was because you couldn't see the apron portion on the stage. We moved up to the third row, right next to the sound and lighting booth and had a perfect view. 

If you're under 30 and were paying the general admission ticket price of $80, I bet you wouldn't be rating this 4 or 5 stars, guaranteed. The fact I got my tickets for free isn't going to make this a 4 or 5 star experience. Disclaimer, I work for a show and my sister is in theater management, so we consider things that the average consumer might not.  

I found the show to be kind of cheesy and the acts could have been cleaner. Things that were supposed to be synchronized were not. The timing was off. If you can't get perfectly synchronized, don't do it. It was like watching a very good quality high school musical - not a Vegas quality show. Things like the costumes and headdresses weren't matched or lined up correctly or that the acrobats were kind of all over the place cheapened the act. The Hispanic lady (I think her name is Joelle or something?) at the beginning of the act looked like she was over the whole thing. The mics were set too high, so it made it difficult to make out what exactly the singers were saying. As well, there are 3 or 4 lights on up center stage, that at times shown directly in my eyes. They were so bright, I had to turn away because it was blinding. They need to fix that. 

The black Sonny for Sonny and Cher was sort of funny. I'd say the only cool act was the magic act. I have no idea how many doves were stuffed into that guy's suit jacket. The gigantic parrot added to that... wow, he was full of birds. I also have to give credit to the band that was playing. I enjoyed the guitar the most. Oh, and I felt like clapping when they were showing the implosions of all the old casinos. To this day, I don't understand the infatuation with 50 year old gambling halls in this city. The old ones look like a blight on the Strip and... well, would you rather have the Frontier or City Center? Ummm... the later, please!

My sister kept checking the time and said she was awfully bored. There were people in the rows in front of us that were just done. They looked like they had fallen asleep in their seats. It would have been nice if the cocktail waitresses weren't walking around the whole time with obnoxious light up cups - at times they blocked the view. It was good that they told everybody to turn off their phones and that there are no pictures allowed. 

If you haven't seen any show, especially a Cirque show, and you're over the age of 35, you'd probably enjoy this show. Otherwise, I'd say you can pay the same amount and see some spectacular shows. The older people in the audience (and I mean people over the age of 60) seemed to love the show, but for me, meh. I've experienced better."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"For the record, I went here last Saturday, November 13th.

So this guy James L was driving up from Phoenix (yeah) for our first date (double yeah) on Saturday. I'm not too into planning dates, because, well, that's not my job as a woman. James hadn't been to Nevada so he wasn't much good as to picking out a Vegas restaurant for us, so we compromised - he'd pick the cuisine and I'd pick the restaurant. He chose middle eastern food and so my search was on. Now Vegas isn't really known for its delicious middle eastern food so it was a bit of a search trying to find a place that wasn't just a spot serving Kronos gyros and mint tea. Some girls I met earlier that day at a meetup.com hike I was on suggested Marrakech.

Well, my date picked me up at 5 and we headed on out to Vegas (because I live in Henderson.) So I've driven past this restaurant about a zillion times but I had no idea what the name was. I thought it was in the same shopping center as Ferraro's but in actuality, it's a little further down the street. After getting turned around and driving on the highway and turning back around, we found the place.

I literally knew nothing about the restaurant other than it was Moroccan, which isn't quite middle eastern but it's really similar - or just enough so that it doesn't much matter for this reviewer. We went inside and were asked if we had a reservation - we didn't, and they sat us anyway, which wasn't a problem because the place was pretty empty. The place was cool - definitely an awesome spot for a first date. The tent like atmosphere is different, it's very dark, so you don't have to worry about looking busted (not that either of us looked busted, actually, it was the exact opposite) because candle light makes everybody 10X better looking. It also makes stealing long kisses easier because you don't feel as if you're being watched by a thousand pairs of peering eyes. 

We were seated in a corner in front of a tiny little table. Be forewarned, I'm 5'9 and James is 6'4 so the leg room is a teeny bit cramped but nothing too tough. A waiter washed our hands and gave us each a terry rag to dry off our hands and to use as a napkin. I'm a fan of rose water so that was fun for me. 

James and I were given a wine menu but we didn't order any booze and we weren't offered whatever free bottle of wine everybody else is talking about. No biggie. We were told it was a prefix menu so... yeah. That's about it. We were asked if we had food allergies, which neither of us had and they brought out the food. 

Hmmmm... I'm not sure how ""Moroccan"" shrimp scampi and bread topped with sesame seeds is, but it was good. It was nothing mind blowing, I mean, it's a dish I made every day after school when I was in the 7th grade - butter, shrimp, garlic and parsley. 

The next was the lentil soup, which was bleh. Michelle M.'s review is right on the money; (including her position on the belly dancer) the soup tasted like canned soup. *Tears*

The crudité plate was good. The picked beets were a nice touch. I wish I would have known we could have taken food to go before they whisked it away to bring out the next course. 

The next was the beef kabob and we each got a weirdly tough piece of meat per skewer. It wasn't the greatest but it wasn't a big deal. 

We didn't eat any of the couscous and dark meat chicken dish - I ended up having it three days later (because we found out from a nice blonde waitress that we could get our food to go) and it was so bland. 

The dessert was decent - I liked that it had walnuts and we ended up taking 98% of it to go.

Honestly, the food left something to be desired,  but the atmosphere was good. I definitely don't think they food was worth the $100 bill he threw down before we left but nonetheless, I enjoyed myself. James could have taken me to the city dump and I would have had just as good of time with him, because, well, let's be real for a second; he was looking and smelling like heaven. I don't know if this place really deserves three whole stars, but I'll give them the extra one because I had a great time and that's really what it's all about."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"This is by far my best clubbing experience so far so I have no idea why crappier clubs have better ratings.

I went here last night (12/12/10) with three friends, had the guest list hook up (free entry!) and got the same yellow wristband Jennifer C. got, so we had free drinks as well! I stuck with a single flute of Champagne because you can't break it down when you're falling all over yourself. 

There was definitely a mixed crowd, a fair number of whites and blacks and some Asians. There was even this random 80 year old couple seriously busting it on the floor. It was really funny because guys were fist pumping with them. Everybody was pretty young on the dance floor (under 30) but some people at the tables were older. 

Taio Cruz said it best, ""I came here to dance"" and that's exactly what I did. I honestly could NOT have cared less if one person had showed up on the dance floor - I was rocking it out. It was as if Jesus had come down to DJ my own personal playlist. THEY PLAYED KEAK DA SNEAK! YES! E-40? YES! CHRIS BROWN? YES X5! Absolutely fabulous music. There was none of that craptastic trance, techno, wailing crap that sounds like they threw in the Kingdom Hearts Video Game Soundtrack on repeat. I literally threw my half full champagne flute up onto the stage to go shake my a** when Chris Breezy came on. 

There is this little raised stage in the center of the dance floor and I went up there twice to dance. I was there from the time the club opened at 11 to 1:20 and spent half my time (cumulative) up on that little stage dancin' around. Just like Lil' Jon said, ""You can't do like me, I'm by myself. I do it so good, I don't need nobody else."" Honestly, I'd rather do my thing by myself than deal with the guys grinding up on me and stabbing me in the back on the dance floor. Uh huh. The ladies know what I mean. One quick observation, you gotta keep it classy, some ladies who came up on the stage forgot this isn't Spearmint Rhino (strip club.) One busted a champagne flute on stage but it was cleaned up in a quick minute when I motioned to a bouncer about the issue.

Oh my goodness, I think there needs to be a sign that says, ""Locals are not here at tourist's disposals and are not subject to their whims. We have hookers for that."" So after dancing with some other guys myself, two of my friends came out on the dance floor with me. There were these two brothers and one was pulling out a couple c notes. I leaned over to my friend and yelled, ""what is going on?!"" and they screamed back (I could barely hear them) ""I have no idea."" There was no way he could have mistaken us for prostitutes because we dress pretty conservative. 

The one pulling out the cash started dancing with me. Wait, no, more like up on me. Get off, seriously. This guy was getting way crazy, IN FRONT OF HIS BROTHER. I was embarrassed for me AND him. My friends were my saving grace because when he started yelling in my ear ""You're so f-ing hot"" and yelling to my friends and his brother that he was ""going to f*** the s*** out of me tonight"" (to my credit, I couldn't hear him say this.)  My friends were like, ""Um, Rachel's not getting raped tonight"" and told the brother that his brother was pissing me off and that he needed to tell him to tone it down and they rushed me on out. I'm not Usher, I don't want to make love in the club... or anywhere else with a stranger.

I spent the rest of the night dancing on the little stage while my friends sat on a bench because they wore heels. I went in search of them at around 1:15 because I was getting thirsty and wanted to leave. Water bottles are $9!!! here and I just wasn't going to pay that. When I couldn't find them and didn't answer my texts, I left. I ended up getting a phone call at 2:20 asking where in the club I was from my friends, as I was laying in bed with the lights off, who had been searching for me for an hour and the cells had been in their car, hence the reason they didn't respond to my messages. Oops! 

Anyway, I had SUCH a fun night, even though that one guy was strange, (hopefully we won't run into them at XS tonight!) but regardless, the club was bumpin' on a SUNDAY in DECEMBER. I for sure want to come back again!"
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"My hair still smells like cigarettes from last night as I type this. (well, it did when I started the review last week!)  Now, onto the review!

So a friend of a friend, who works for Tao group, was giving us the hookup when she invited us out to Tao with her Dec. 2 (Thursday.) We got in free with the VIP stamp, and just walked right in with her, and we had full access to an open bar. Who can complain about free everything?! I'm a fan of free!

We got in about 10:15 PM and immediately headed upstairs with the three other girls I was with. The girls that lay by the staircase weren't out and neither were the bathtub bathers - which for me, is a-okay. We went to the bar for our gratis drinks; I happened to have a very tasty amaretto sour (the only mixed drink I like) sans a marachino cherry. Thank you Tao for saving me $11!

The dance floors were deserted in the main room and we sorta just walked around and hung out on the balcony for a little bit before dancing for maybe 30 minutes. We were approached by some girls taking pictures of guests who they had given Holly Madison's new Hypnotique shots (gawd, Hypnotique is gross) so we did that, and then they came back and wanted a second shot, so I posed and gave them back the shot - I like being sober. 

After that, we headed to the lounge room (whatever the smaller dance floor is upstairs is called.) There was maybe 6 girls just dancing around (one was way drunk.) Luckily, some guys made it to the dance floor - oh wait, no, only one did, and he was dancing with me. Ha. After about 20 minutes some more guys showed up and the floor started getting filled up. 

Some guys I had noticed earlier were now in the lounge and one of them got stuck on me. Oh lordy, he had on Crafters (those rectangle glasses featured in every freakin' Lens Crafters ads) and so I got separated from my group and just chilled with him on the balcony after wading through the crowd gaping, with cellphones raised, at Holly Madison, who was hanging out at a private table (have these people never seen a prostitute before? It's Vegas...)

The balcony is really nice, and the bouncers make sure it doesn't get too busy. It's really the only place you can have a conversation and truly hear what the other person is saying. When this guy was telling me how he charged $2,000 to a 40% interest credit card to come on this vacation, I was literally already in the process of walking away but alas, it was a joke -  if I had been inside the club, I wouldn't have heard the ""it's a joke"" part and the night would have ended very differently (which would have been good for me and bad for him.)

Let me just say that I'm not Bobby Brackins; I'm not lookin' for some love in the club. I have no desire to hook up with random fools on vacation looking to bump or get as close as possible to doing such, but you will find a ton of that in this club - either in business suits (tons of business men) or So Cal Asian cool kids. 

After hanging out on the balcony, this guy, Mike (the one with the Crafters) was really pressuring me to go back to his suite with him because he saw (from reading a text message over my shoulder) that my friends had gone home after not being able to locate me. I held out and we went back to his table he bought with his suite mates. Um, yeah, I wouldn't spend that sort of ridiculous money for a table, but if you want to dance without being in a cattle car, find a guy with a table. The velvet ropes keep the drunk wild dancers out, and there is room to breathe. There are a zillion attendants making sure the table drinks and condiments are filled. There is a huge Kentucky Derby-like cup that holds ice. After being offered a drink from the table, and me declining, I was told to at least have something, so I took an ice cube. Ha. Not bad.

Mike was dead set on us ""taking a walk around the shops;"" out of towner club guy translation: ""let's go to my suite."" (There will be a review about this. Don't worry, I didn't do anything! Bleh!) so I relented and we walked out of the club. On the way out, I got some snazzy (yet too small) flip flops. These are the real deal, not some cheap-o pair.  Nice!

Overall, Tao is great when stuff is free and you don't have to wait in line. I don't know if I would have had a nice time if I had to wait in line and pay like everybody else, but my experience was pretty fun!"
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"When I moved to Brentwood, CA in 2009, my eco-friendly/hippy/local/green/sustainability obsession grew about 900%. I couldn't get enough information about going green. I wanted to know everything from DIY Bokashi recipes to spinning my own wool to make into thread. Needless to say, I always had Planet Green on the TV. So one day, I'm sitting in my living room, sewing God only knows what, I was watching Living With Ed on Planet Green on my DVR. The episode was, as always, about sustainability and Ed was traveling out to some place in Nevada called Springs Preserve. I was instantly enamored with what I saw on the TV, especially the gardens and the clips about eco-friendly home building. I had to go... but it was a cool 9 hour drive from my house in the SF Bay Area. That wasn't going to happen any time soon

Fast forward to 2011 - I'm living in Vegas. I had been begging my family and friends to go to Springs Preserve with me since I moved to Vegas back in June of 2010. I was hard selling the kids programs to my mom to no avail. Everyone had zero interest in going. Scratch that, after months of begging to go, my parents and youngest siblings went to Springs Preserve the day before my flight came in from Colorado Springs, back in January, because they're so nice like that. Nobody would go with me.

Actually, there is one person who would go with me - Beau S. He promised he'd take me at some point in time and well, because he's moving away this week, he decided to make good on his promise and take me to Springs Preserve on 5/21/11. Honestly, it's the sweetest thing anybody's done for me in years. 

Going in, I had high expectations and Beau didn't. We had looked up their site the night before at his house and well, the site makes it seem boring. We pulled up and walked over to the ticket office. $10 for NV residents, $8 for students with ID, so it came to $18 for us to get in.

I'm pretty sure we were the only people without a dog with us there that day. Actually, I think we were the only couple there without a child and/or a dog. I hate to say this, but the exhibits and animals are really geared to little kids under the age of 12. I understand that they want to appeal to children, but adults can make changes because they have the money and make the decisions, so I wish the Origen Museum had a more adult oriented museum. I know they're doing some exhibit changes currently, so hopefully they think of their adult audience and cater to them.

Beau looked like he wanted to get out of there asap and take a nap, so I was torn between wanting to read everything in the museum and not making him sit around when I knew he didn't want to be there. I skimmed over a bunch of placards, except in the green building exhibit. I liked the rammed earth wall they had on display (What I want to build my dream house out of) and the ""where does your electricity come from exhibit"" - as you probably guessed, the cheapest, most efficient energy sources are overlooked in favor of burning off coal to power Nevada. *long sigh.* 

The backyard display is great and it's awesome that Springs Preserve has the resources to help people make eco friendly and water smart decisions when it comes to their homes. They will help you plan if you ask! Whoever did the landscaping did an incredible job here.

The gardens are gorgeous- I didn't even know plants like this, and the amount here, could grow in Nevada. It looked lush! I skipped reading the home garden stuff because Beau was obviously not even remotely interested in any of it, but I took some good mental notes and am inspired but what I saw. 

The drawbacks of this place are:
-Confusing layout.
-Geared almost entirely to children.
-Restaurant was closed.
-Too expensive for non-Nevada residents.

The pluses of this place are:
-Pretty gardens with ample seating.
-Interesting green building exhibit.
- Super cool bathroom faucets. Springs Preserve is entirely water sustainable because they recycle all of their water rather than sending it to the sewers.
-Lots of classes available.

Would I come back here? Yes, but only when they open the other buildings that are under construction. I'd probably go by myself because I hate feeling like I'm making somebody wait on me to read stuff when they have zero interest in being there. Beau was sweet to take me there, so I had a good time, but it would have been better if there had been things there for him to enjoy as well."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"Never in my 7 years of reviewing my experiences on Yelp have I ever encountered any business owner who is so unabashedly unprofessional that it would warrant a review such as this. I'm aghast at the owner's response as I didn't mention things in my initial review like unclean tables, or dipping napkins in our water cups to clean our hands, as I gave this place the benefit of the doubt that this wasn't their norm.

My original 3 star review, along with the addendum that I added as a response to the owner's comment on my original review will be at the bottom of this piece.

What happens when you combine the petulant entitlement of a spoilt millennial, a startling lack of ethics, and unbridled hostility? An experience at Fukuburger.

I grew up in a family that owned a b2b produce company that spanned multiple generations. They supplied restaurants & grocers with produce. I also had to go through multiple food business courses at UNLV's hotel college for my minor. This program is rated neck & neck with Cornell for the top program in the country. I understand how food costs are determined & I understand purchasing. I also understand that no two customers are alike and that matters of taste and value are subjective and unique to each person. Ex: bun cost. I don't eat them, therefore, where they're made is irrelevant to me.

Anyone who has attended a US public school is familiar with a bell curve. In grading, some people will fail, some will ace the class, but the majority of people fall somewhere in the middle. They're not bad, they're not exceptional, they're simply average. From my profile, anyone can see that my reviews follow a statistically natural bell curve. Most of my experiences are neither terrible or so exceptional that I proselytize for them. Such was my initial experiences w/ Fuku.

While the owner tries to silence dissent by throwing around baseless accusations of racism and resorts to a favorite of tyrants everywhere - libelous character assassination, he fails to address my values as a customer. 

Quizzically, the owner believes that stating his restaurant's & clientele's style is ""racist."" This place doesn't serve rustic, country fare. It's a place that has a tatted, suggestive menu girl, hip hop on the speakers, sports on TV, & Asian pop art on the walls. Saying it is urban and reminds me of the pop/hip hop ABDC show is no more racist than calling a place a hipster hangout or biker dive bar.

I believe strongly in the principles of freedom of speech, information & dissent. I believe in standing up for truth, regardless of the slings and arrows a business owner throws. Customers have a right to express average experiences.

People should know that the owner hypocritically lectures me on my review ethics despite dating a former Yelp intern, and he violates the TOS by offering meals, free of charge, to those who write positive reviews, as evidenced by his owner comments on other reviews that have been flagged. No wonder his avg. is so high. I don't know who he's friends with, or why he's so offended that he felt the need to go on the warpath, but nothing would surprise me. I don't advertise that I review on Yelp to businesses, nor have I ever accepted compensation in exchange for a favorable review. My reviews are trustworthy.

May this 3rd business shutter like the other 2 locations.
--------------
Original review: This place is the definition of hype. I've had their food truck fare and was meh about it. Gave them another chance and went here on 6/4/15. I had the butta burger along with fries. Nothing about the food warrants these prices, especially because everything is ala carte and will run in the midteens for a burger, fries and a drink.

Okay, so everyone here looks like they're from ABDC & it has an urban SoCal vibe. The food has artistically drizzled mayonnaise atop it. Whatever, the flavors are lacking and the value just isn't there.

***edited to add - don't worry, I won't give this place another dime. Apparently commenting on the vibe or clientele  is racist, even though Yelp has such things ""hipster"" vibe ambience option. Owner is resorting to petty attacks because his feelings are hurt because of a 3 star review, not a 1 star, a THREE star review. The food was bland to me and not a good value. Not everyone is going to be an ""omg I'm a fan"" of the business. Maybe the other locations would still be open if I alone thought that the prices weren't justified but that's not reality."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"There was one reason, and one reason only I was willing to risk life, limb and a degree on my moral compass to get into Pure: CHRIS BROWN. 

I'm not one to go to a club, restaurant or shady bathroom to go see some soon to be Z-lister drink comped $20 vodka (priced at a foolish $500 for everybody else not shopping at Trader Joe's) It's just not who I am. Why was this time different? Umm... it's Chris Breezy; not a Z-lister. Oh yeah, and it's Chris Brown; as if any explination is needed. Pfft. Rhianna drama blah blah blah, umm...don't care, I was going.

After work, my coworker Antonio and a friend show up at 11:35 PM on 5/8/11 with moi after rushing to throw my work clothes into Antoino's car in the parking garage. There was a FAT mass of people swarming the entrance. There was no coherent line. The bouncers had no idea what was going on in the aforementioned cluster fuck of weaves, fine (and by ""fine"" I mean ""fake"") jewelery and attitude you could cut a knife with. 

I don't know where the line started - Anotonio supposedly knows somebody who was supposed to get us in but between the zero cell reception at Ceasar's and the deafening roar of ""Ey ma, what's good"" and other eye roll worthy phrases thrown at me, there's no way we could hear if a call were to go through.

 If I said I was seeing Chris Brown, then Hell or high water, I was getting into the club to see him. I spotted a group trying to ford the sea of 5-inch long-ghetto-faboulous acrylic claws. They had bottle service and the bouncer was letting them through up to the front of the ""line"" (term used very loosely.) I grabbed my friends' hands and pretended like I was in their group, just so I get up to the front. Yeah, cutting in line is wrong, and normally I wouldn't do this but... eff this nonsense, I was ""making it work"" to get in to see Breezy.

We made it. We were at the front. I heard some British guy, 3 people behind me, asking people to find out how to get in if there was bottle service. I pulled him up behind me, having him cut off two people, and said, ""so you're letting us in with you, right?"" He said, ""Umm..."" I said, ""I'm getting you in past the line and you're getting me and my two friends in with your table. I don't want to sit with you, I don't want your booze, I just want to get in."" It was 12:20 AM by this time. I yelled to a bouncer that I had a table, he asked what it was under, I yelled to the British guy to give me the name and a few list checks later, me, my two friends and the British guy's group were inside, NO COVER.  Fortune favors the bold... that's how you get inside without paying a cover on the biggest night of the year for this club.

My goodness, this club is cramped. They were well over capacity. We parted ways after a quick wave ""thanks."" The three of us headed to the main dance floor to get to the bathrooms, and then see Breezy. 

I know what it's like to stand up without using my legs. I have never been smashed between so many people in my life - I was having trouble breathing because my chest couldn't fully expand, that's how many people were on the dance floor. After miraculously getting to the bathrooms, we were in a prime spot to get spitting distance away from Breezy's table. We were maybe 5 people away and we were getting pushed and elbowed and every other uncomfortable prodding thing, as idiot girls thought that if they pushed hard enough, the million people in front of them would evaporate, and they'd catch Breezy's eye and in a matter of minutes be under him on some bed. I know, I know, they're delusional, but it didn't stop them from pushing hard (with drinks in their hands, so of course we all got covered in cheap booze.) 

For the first time in my life, I seriously thought I might be trampled to death - and I'm not exaggerating. I was really concerned because the bouncers didn't have things under control. It was actually really frightening. A few people in front of us left, probably fearing the same thing, so now we were two people away from his table. Breezy finally waltzed in at 1:15 AM to an uproar from the crowd. After getting some pictures, I had had enough. I was not going to be trampled to death by a sea of shoes from Shiek's, in a club... in Ceasar's Palace no less. I couldn't die like that, so at 1:45 AM I left.

I left the club and I don't think the outside line moved at all. Actually, I think it doubled. I told people, as I was coming out, ""Don't waste your time, it's so packed, they'll never let you in."" 

I will never go back to Pure. Their team has no clue about crowd control, forming lines, or general patron safety. No bueno!"
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"Chateau - your layout is horrific, and your entry lines are confusing. Luckily, you're teeming with a million guy dimes. 

I went here last night, 3/11/11 with Jen S., Bill M., Ronaldo, Crystal, and Alex R. I couldn't find where my friends were because they said they were ""outside"" of the club. Well, little did I know there's an ""inside"" line outside of the club, and an ""outdoor"" line outside of the club. I assumed they were in the line that was near the side entrance of Sugar Factory. Nope, they were inside the Paris, waiting in line. Confusing. 

The six of us waited and waited and I couldn't figure out why the heck we were waiting in line when we were on the guest list of Max, a guy who works there, that Jen also knows personally. Well... come to find out, by turning my head to the right and seeing ""The Situation,"" from Jersey Shore come strutting down the red carpet, I figured out why we were stuck waiting - it has to look like he has a crowd. Ummmmm.... lame. People were flipping out taking pictures of him. *yawn.*

Finally, Jen spotted Max and he walked us up to the outside entrance and cut us in front of everybody. We had to wait because the bouncer said they were, and I quote, ""waiting for the fire marshal to leave before they let in more people so they won't get a fine."" WOW! Safe! A group of busted girls were commenting to Alex about the girls in our group, asking him who ""the ring leader"" was, why we were in front and just were generally being catty because we were brought to the front of the line. I had to ask out loud why there was a group of witches trying to get into the club. People need to get over themselves. 

In addition to our wristbands that entitled us to a free drink, upon entry, we got another free drink coupon. I gave mine to Jen because I just didn't want to drink. Oh, I should mention that your wrist band is scanned on entrance so you can't try to pass your wrist band off to somebody else to get more drinks. Smart!

This club was PACKED. I'm talking jam packed on the balcony. It was difficult to move and there was no actual dance floor - just walkways jammed with people. While waiting for everybody to get their drinks at a bar, I was smashed between a bunch of people and an unnecessary outdoor heater. A glass rolled by my foot and I bent down to pick it up. All of the sudden, Richard Branson's doppelganger, puts his hand over mine and tells me I should never feel obligated to pick up anything and ""insert more bizarre sappy stuff."" Yeah, he wasn't the only guy oogling and making comments during the night, so if you're looking for bizarre flirtatious comments from old guys, I guess this is your place.

We headed inside and were nearly crushed to death about halfway in by the crowd moving parallel with the location of ""The Situation."" Annoying. People weren't dancing, they were just standing, mouths agape, cell phones high in the air. It was getting aggravating because the dance floor is poorly laid out - no matter where you are, you're in a line of traffic.  We had to form a human chain just to get around this place and not get separated. 

The music was eh, okay. DJ Hollywood was spinning inside and it was mostly Top 40 mash-ups. Frankly, it annoys me when a song gets played for a good 13.7 seconds before switching to the next song. The music playing outside was different than inside. When some Italian techno song (popular, I can't remember the name) came on, the DJ prompted the crowd to ""make some noise if we got Italians in the house."" Dead silence from the crowd. I about died. I've never heard a crowd completely ignore a DJ before. 

It was getting stuffy inside so Alex and I went outside and headed for the bathrooms. Yep, the line for the bathroom is outside  - what happens if it's raining? They have single stalls just like at Gold Lounge - AGGHH!!! so if you just want to wash your hands and check your hair, you gotta get in line. Annoying. 

The ONLY thing going for this club is that fact there are a ZILLION hot guys here, working and clubbing. Even the guys cleaning the floors were dimes (one of them had to pick up a tampon that fell on the ground on the dance floor! Eeeek!) I was surprised that all the hot guys were surrounded by a sea of really fug chicks that were super drunk. Everywhere I looked, girls were getting stupid drunk or looked like they were on crack with their eyes rolling back in their heads. It'd be nice if everyone put down the pipe for a good long minute and just danced without being inebriated. 

Overall, the club is so poorly laid out that it makes dancing, you know, that thing people come to clubs to do, almost impossible. 2.5 stars."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"For my 800th review (and my 100th for 2014) I'm finally reviewing my absolute favorite place in Las Vegas - Surfset!

I found Surfset through the CMYE Fit Club series back in Feb. 2014. I did a blend class after fasting for 9 days and absolutely fell in love. Even though I was too weak at the time to keep up with everyone, I still completed the class. Don't let whatever issue you have keep you from these classes! All fitness levels can take these classes because they're tailored to you and you will definitely see your body becoming stronger in time.

After the first class, I was hooked. The next week I signed up for an entire year of unlimited classes for $600 (promotional rate.) There are various promotional rates for different increments of time. Currently, a week of unlimited classes is $20. Totally worth it. 

Now, I've gone to tons of their classes and I can't recommend this place enough. Since my time here, I've tried every Surfset class that is offered and have begun taking their new Hot Hula and belly dance classes. (I've yet to try their off-board yoga classes because it doesn't fit in with my weird work schedule.)

There are four different classes offered and each session is different - you'll never get tired of doing the same routine over and over. 

Maybe you're wondering how this whole thing works. Basically, each class you're on a surfboard that sits about 6- 8 inches off of the ground on a stand. Inside the stand are three small balance balls that the board rests upon. On each side of the board are two bungee cords that can be hooked to the stand to stabilize your board. As you become stronger and more comfortable using the board, you can remove one or both of the stabilizing bands to challenge yourself. I've been doing this since February and am only using one stabilizing band.

As far as Surfset classes that are offered, there are four basic types and each run about 45 minutes:

Build: Using kettlebells, slosh tubes, and resistance bands on the board, you'll be able to do squats, swings, flies, and all sorts of body weight exercises build your muscles. Tends to be a slower paced but killer workout.

Balance: A good class for beginners or people who believe that they're not so good at staying balanced. Slower pace class focuses on doing squats, planks, various yoga poses, and floor to board moves. Advance balance classes focus on doing more moves while laying on your back. Usually I combine a balance and a build class back to back because of the fact they're slower paced classes.

Burn: High intensity cardio class. If you love to do lots of floor to board work, jumps, hops, and jogging, you'll love this class. Personally, I hate cardio so I tend to stay away from this class unless I aboslutely can't fit anything else into my schedule - but lots of people love it.

Blend: A combination class that encorporates moves and pace from Build, Balance and Blend classes. This is my go-to class. There are basically two sections of  build, balance and burn classes, with 3 moves repeated twice per section with a ""surf session"" at the end. Moves from each class and which moves are repeated are always different. Advance classes utilize more difficult moves and moves are 3 combination moves, each in turn made up of 3 moves. Advanced classes can be quite challenging but a killer and fun workout.

Jason and his team are absolutely incredible. When I first began I was going every day. Now that summer is here, my work schedule isn't permitting me to come as often thanks to my coworkers going on vacation like crazy. Luckily once summer is over (soon!!!) I'll be back to my daily grind here. Jason and his team are so cool, so friendly, and really encouraging. I feel bad when I don't get to come to class - not because I feel guilty, but because I feel like my week wasn't as fun or fulfilling if I'm not there each day.

Recently Hot Hula classes were added. No, you don't take hula in a hot room, it's ""hot"" as in sexy! I absolutely love coming to class and while I was pretty rusty at first, I feel I've gotten way better at picking up sequences and counting. Classes are an hour and by the end, I'm always pouring sweat but having the BEST time. Even more recently, belly dance classes were added. They're not your tradtional Egyptian classes - more of a tribal type that is set at a slower pace and to trance like music.

Like I mentioned before, I've yet to take the yoga classes but I feel I already have a pretty full plate already. Honestly, the only reason, and I do mean ONLY reason I don't want to leave Vegas as much as I dislike living here is because I wouldn't get to come here anymore. I love the people, the trainers and the classes here. It's seriously the best."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"""Sink water, cigarettes and acetone."" Those were the words that came out the mouths of my sisters to describe the flavors of the ""food"" at Big Horn yesterday. 

I am so livid after paying $34 and some change for this horrific slop. I hope every P.O.S. that wrote a 4 or 5 star review for this place goes to Hell. Every time a person writes a review giving high marks, when they know the food is mediocre, they're swindling money from future customers, even if they're not the ones receiving it. 

After leaving without ordering at Pit Stop, I took my two sisters out to lunch while my dad and brother went fishing at Lake Mead. Eff. What a mistake. It was 5:20 PM when we walked in yesterday (7/10/11) and it was a ghost town. I would have felt like such an ass turning around and walking out when the waitress looked excited that somebody finally walked in, so we took a table. Mistake.

Really, $7.98 for the kids' meals? 3 chicken strips and fries for a 5 year old cost me $8?! Between the completely empty restaurant, and the bizarre menu mix with prices that don't match the ambiance or the location ($4 to add chicken to a Caesar salad?!) We should have walked out right then. 

We all ordered waters. My youngest sister (the 5 year old) took a drink, scrunched up her nose and said, ""This tastes like sink water."" The water tasted dirty and full of chlorine. You could actually smell the water. My other sister (21 year old) said she wasn't going to drink it unless she had to wash something down. It was horrible.

So we ordered 1 kid's meal with chicken strips, my sister ordered a plain Caesar salad ($7.98) and I ordered the chicken tajine ($15.98.) My dish came with either minestrone soup (how an Italian soup goes with anything else on the menu is beyond me) or a side salad. I ordered the side salad with blue cheese dressing.

My salad looked fine. The dressing tasted like it was one of those Ken's dressing packets, even though it was served in a little tin cup. The waitress brought out pita bread and butter for the table with my salad. The pita bread had strange little burn marks all over it. My sister took a bite and said ""this tastes like a cigarette."" The bread had the weirdest burnt smoky taste - like the grill had caught fire. I honestly think the bread had been heated in a burnt pan. It was gawd awful and had a funky burnt smell, even on the parts that weren't burnt. 

When the food came out, I was ticked. This tajine looked like a scoop of rice pilaf, green olives stuffed with pimentos and a boneless, skinless chicken breast that had been boiled in water with turmeric. The only thing that looked decent was the green zucchini... until I turned it over. The zucchini on the side facing up looked like it had been lightly sauteed. I flipped all the pieces over and SURPRISE! every piece was dark brown or full on black. Yep, apparently they didn't think I would be able to notice when tasting the food that it was burnt. 

The rice was BLAND. I added a ton of butter packets (from the cigarette pita basket) and salt and pepper. Nothing could add any flavor to it. I took a bite of the chicken. It wasn't seasoned. (When I brought it home in a to go box, my mom took one look at it and agreed it wasn't seasoned.) I've made tajine before - I'm some white chick from Texas and I can make it 1,000 times better than this place. Tajine (Tagine) is supposed to be this wonderful, fragrant, sweet and savory dish containing diced meat, carrots, peppers, eggplant, cinnamon, allspice, garlic, turmeric, cumin, cayenne, dried fruit (raisins or apricots) and onions. This... this was not tajine. This was crap. 

My sister took a bite of her Caesar salad and said ""this dressing tastes like acetone."" Why would dressing taste like acetone (nail polish remover)? Because it is rancid. The only thing decent we all ate was the three of us shared the kids meal - which came with a little tin cup of Kraft ranch dressing. It has a distinct fake taste.  

This was by far the WORST meal I've ever had. This empty restaurant, with its sticky tables, flip-flop clad waitress, overpriced, burnt, dirty food needs a date with Gordon Ramsey on Kitchen Nightmares. The fact that nobody is coming in should be a huge red herring to the owners that the food is awful and the prices are outrageous. 
The quality of the food is lacking so much that this food should be going for max, $5 a plate. 

I have never been so livid and felt so ripped off in all my life after eating at a restaurant. I want my money back. I hope the owner is reading this review and takes note. My receipt is the one that has the word's ""I'm going to review this place on Yelp.com later."" Please refund my money because the food was atrocious. Shameful!"
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"Oooh, it makes me happy to know I'm one of the first three reviewers of this place because, well, I Yelp alot. Ha. I was dying to go there prior to the opening just so I could review it first. I know, lame.

Anyway, I was invited to go club at Marquee, prior to its official opening to the general public on 1/1/11. Because it's owned by Tao Group, employees of Tao Group & their guests could get in during industry nights. I went on 12/29/10 & I was first in line.

I don't know how it will be when it opens, but I was by myself because my three friends hadn't shown up yet. I just stood in the guest list line by myself & chatted with one of the security guards for a long time. He told me I could walk around if I wanted until my party arrived & that he'd let me right back in the very front, no matter how long the line got. Good deal, but I knew my friends would probably be pretty late & I might as well just go in when the club opened. 

Oh, we didn't line up on the first floor where it says ""Marquee;"" the line is actually upstairs, so go up the escalators, & get in the lines up there. After you are let in through the line & get your two stamps, a bouncer will check your ID & point you to the elevators next to him. You'll get in one of three elevators that will take you to the club. These same elevators take you back out of the club - you'll be let off on the second floor again, even though the club entrance & the same elevators are one floor down. I don't know what's up with that. 

Upon entering the club, you're let off in a room with a bar & signs to The Library on your left, The Boom Box to the front right of you, & the main dance floor to your direct right. I went to check out The Boom Box first, which you have to walk down two flights of stairs to get to - good luck if you're drunk. It was only opened for a viewing so there was no music playing. It is a pretty decent sized room with a bar, tables & a dance floor. 

Later during the night, I went to The Library - good luck if your feet hurt or you're drunk, because you have to go up six flights of stairs & a hall way behind the two story main dance floor screen to get to it. There are pool tables & books (only bottle service tables to sit at) & a bar. There's not really any dance floor but there is music playing. There's also a balcony that is covered by sheer panels that overlooks the main dance floor. I was intrigued most by the lighting equipment & the gels they used. (Gels are what you put over theatrical lights to make them look colored, FYI.)

The main dancefloor actually has a smaller dance floor separated by a walkway for overflow - it is sorely needed. Dancefloors are ALWAYS too small in these clubs, which sucks. The overflow dance floor is next to the main bar, & has doors leading out to the outside, which isn't open yet, but is absolutely gorgeous - tons of chaises & heaters. There is a second bar (it is the first bar if you enter the dance floor by entering left out of the elevators - the whole club is a big circle.) The second bar is where you need to head to find the (ugly but large) bathrooms & a lounge area that has FREE SEATING. Yes! Because I was there for a promotional industry night, there was a free photo booth by politeinpublic.com, Moet Chandon & Seven Magazine where our pictures were taken, printed out, & given to us in a press pass necklace. I like free, so... cool.

The main floor music was the same as it is at Tao & Lavo - a little less house music than Lavo, actually. They played Too $hort & E-40 so I was happy. The Library had techno/house. The crowd was more white than any other club I've been to thus far, which I'm not knocking, it's just a fact. This is of course probably because it was only open to Tao Group. There were a lot of older people there (50-60's.) I'm assuming they're investors with their wives/mistresses/hired hoes. Will they be there when it opens, probably not. The rest of the crowd was like Tao's - young people & business men. 

One side comment, I really disliked the videos playing on the two story screen. There was one they kept playing of girls in black underclothes, with white stoic masks in a dark room touching all over each other or walking up stairs, or standing at attention. I'm not buying the avent guard ""art"" BS. I'm more than well versed in political and pop culture symbolism and that immediately stuck out to me as sex slave psychological abuse, especially when I saw the masks. Basically, it's a psychological tool used to make the victim disassociate during a sex act which aids to break down their sense of self during abuse. It's a way to take away an victim's identity so that they're basically just a shell of themself and can be abused further without resistance. I'm not some typical drunk clubber who thinks I'm just looking at art. I know what it is they're showing, and I don't think it's cute.

Good music, interesting design but I don't care to go back."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"This review is dedicated to Matt S. because he likes when I talk smack about random weirdos I meet at clubs here in Vegas. You're welcome.

After hitting up Mix and Ghostbar, which should have been named ""Ghost Town,"" on 1/27/11, my newly 21 year old sister, me, Jen S. and Amy hit up Moon. There was a total of... not a single soul in line. After chatting with the guy who put us on the elevator, telling us he hadn't been to a club in two years, even though he works for one, we were inside the club.

It's small in here. Not as small as that POS Eve, or Lolitas, but the actual dance floor is a bit bigger than Tryst, without all the tables and stripper poles. What makes it nice? The balcony, which is even higher than the one next door at Ghostbar. 

So we walk in and out the blue, Jen finds a group of three British friends - James C., Ross and Sean. 5 seconds in, she's already taking pictures with them. So random. I thought she knew them, but apparently not. The super good looking one in the group, Sean, started mackin' on some random Russian chick after all of us girls went to check out the gorgeous view from the balcony.

Well, somehow, we were unable to shake the two guys from"" the trio of friends from south west England traveling the globe after graduating University. "" Do I believe it? Ummm... no. They're probably living in North Las Vegas or some bs. Who knows, who cares?

Oh Gawd. So I was chatting it up with this guy James, who looks a whole lot like an older (22) British version of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and his weirdo friend Ross comes up and starts dancing with me. EWWW. I'm talking major nasty. First of all, he's so drunk that the idea of personal boundaries has not even entered his mind. Secondly, I don't know if he hallucinated that we knew each other and that I said it was okay for him to get all gross up on me, but I didn't and it's not okay. After ignoring this guy, pushing his hands off me, moving across the dance floor and telling him ""no"" a zillion times, James came to my rescue and told Ross to beat it. Thank God. I thought I was saved for the night. I was sorely mistaken.

After getting hyphy to Edward Maya's ""Stereo Love"" - club mix (This is the only House/Techno/w/e the hell genre this song is apart of, that I love and can stand.) that weirdo Ross came back up to me, ignoring my general disgust and zero interest in him. As my sister said, he looked like he should have been either a founder of Ben & Jerry's or working for ""Life is Good."" He looked like a grosso hippy that should be smokin' at UC Santa Cruz or Humboldt State. Over the bleh music, James saved me again and offered to get me a drink. Thanks, but no thanks. I have rules people - no accepting free drinks from guys! At this point, Amy had left, so my sister and Jen were bought drinks, which was fine with me. 

The music was kinda not that great. For every one good song, there were like, 5 bad songs. Some guy kept asking me if I was having a good time then would segue into harassing me to dance with him. I told him I couldn't dance to such bad music so, lo siento compadre, or as my sister said, ""Beat it, Seal."" (Seal as in the singer, not the furry kind that get made into coats.)

We all took a break out on the balcony, mainly so I could get away from Ross. Some couple came up to me and Jen and asked what the best club to go to was. ""Is it XS? What about Tryst?"" Ummmm.... NONE OF THE ABOVE. We all took pictures and chilled outside for a bit. The weather was perfect, as was the view. Tons of space to sit and relax. Unfortunately I can see this place being a major sardine can in the summer - smelly, cramped and greasy.

Finally some good music came on and we all went back in to dance. There were some people gettin' major crazy. There was a few bachelorette parties there and they were either dancing like elephants on the tops of the booths, or making out like they were trying out for a part in Starz' Spartacus. It was kinda gross. One chick who was dressed like a ho with a veil, and was sucking the life out of some guy she was making out with, had a thigh the size of my torso. :-/ 

Averting my eyes, I saw that creep who couldn't keep his hands to himself - Ross. AGAIN. GAWD. GO AWAY! I told James that if Ross was going to come near me one more time, I was kissing him (James) in front of him so he'd (Ross) would get the hint and leave me the eff alone. 5 seconds later I was planting a very closed mouthed kiss on James - it worked! I didn't see that creeper at all since then. 

The night got progressively more boring as the guys got drunker, I got tired and the music got worse. I tried to find the exit to only by pass them multiple times. Yeah, the exit elevators are across from the main bar. The bouncer made us wait forever behind some ropes just so we could leave.

Eh, would I go back? Yes. They only stipulation would be that there must be a ratio of 2:1 BETTER MUSIC : Current playlist."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"Rewind to 11:00 PM on 4/7/14. I was driving back to work from Southern Hills hospital when my side began to feel strange. 

At 11:30, as I'm driving home, I'm not so sure I can make it.  My side, my appendix, I have no clue, feels like the worst pain I've ever had in my life. 

I get home, and somehow crawl to my bathroom because I am doubled over in pain. I have no idea what is going on. I promptly vomit multiple times. I know Niyen I. has had his appendix out, so I text him, in between screams, for a possible confirmation of what I suspect is my appendix bursting. 

Niyen tells me he's on his way to come get me to take me to the hospital. I crawl to my bedroom to get a piece of paper where I start scribbling down all of my personal information, regular physician, everything I could possibly think of in case I passed out  so that Niyen would have the information to give to the doctor.  

Niyen got to my house around 12:20AM, got me into the car and I directed him to go here as this was the absolute closest hospital to me. Plus, I was too embarrassed to go to Southern Hills seeing as I had walked through their ER not even 90 minutes prior like a functioning human being.

Once we got into the ER waiting room at about 12:30-45, the first thing the receptionist had me do was start signing things. It's a good thing I wasn't shot or bleeding out onto the floor, lest I not be able to sign whatever the heck it was I signed. As a non-cognizant human being, I thrust my paperwork at Niyen and had him fill it out as I curled up into the fetal position on some ottomans. 

A few minutes later, I was taken back to an actual bed in the ER and told to change into a hospital gown.  At this point, I didn't even care what I looked like or anything. I ripped off my dress, standing there topless trying to get this hospital gown open. 

As a patient, a suggestion; can these gowns not have their ties tied with each washing? I'm sorry, but when I'm delirious with pain, I just don't have the mental fortitude to try to untie what seemed like a nautical knot to get myself dressed. I gave up, defeated, and had Niyen untie it and dress me. 

I screamed and crawled around on my hospital bed for what must have been a good hour+. During that time the doctor came in to ask me where it was hurting (my lower right quadrant) did my back hurt (no) and did I have a history of kidney stones (no.) I was told medicine would be coming. 

I don't know about you, but I don't think anyone wants to hear me scream. Maybe the nurses really didn't care because seriously, why was I left screaming like a banshee for an hour? I don't get it. Clearly pain management is not at the top of the list of priorities.

My nurse, Rebecca, came in to administer my IV, to get a blood sample, etc. I was so dehydrated that she couldn't get any blood out of my arm whatsoever. She told me the IV was for my medicine. I asked her when I would be able to get some. Her curt response, ""When I get it."" OH, OKAY, I'm sorry for bothering you. Niyen had to ask 3 times where it was at after she left, which was another good 30-45 minutes until I finally got medicine. 

I got wheeled in for an x-ray and the guy, who I didn't catch his name, was the only guy who seemed to genuinely care or have an ounce of bedside manner. He directed Niyen on keeping me calm (which he did the whole night because he is a good person) and getting me through that whole process. All the stars go to this x-ray tech. 

I had medication at that point so I was doing a lot better. After the x-rays, another nurse came in with some sort of mobile credit card scanner to make sure they got my $250 co pay. Now, I can respect the hustle in getting your money, but I have a big issue with the fact that nobody could hurry up and get me to the point of not feeling like I was being ripped apart from the inside, but when it's time to get paid, trust that you're not even going to be out of your bed or have a diagnosis before they come around looking for money. At least at St. Rose Siena, you pay on your way out of the hospital.

 The doctor told me that the x-ray showed that I had kidney stones. No mention of how many, how large nothing. When I got home, my discharge papers didn't even mention those facts. They did mention a strainer that I was supposed to use to catch a kidney stone to make sure I passed it, but alas, the hospital had never given me one, nor verbally told me anything about after care. I did get a prescription for... MIDOL (LOL OK) and a very strong pain killer. I wish I would have been given some more information because I had no idea how many of these things I would have to go through. The next week was an absolute nightmare as these things passed. At least this hospital is on top of getting their co pay. 

In the end, we were in the ER for more than 3 hours. 

If it weren't for Niyen, I'd probably still be at the hospital trying to untie my gown. Will not be back."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"As Too $hort said, ""I don't rap if the beat don't knock."" Well, I don't dance if the beat don't bump, and Tryst doesn't bump, it barely vibrates. 

I went to Tryst at 9:58 PM on Thursday night (yesterday) and I was the first person in line. Yeah, the times on here are wrong, it opens at 10:30. Four other chicks and I were on the guest list (free entry) and were the first people to step into the club with two free drink tickets each. 

Let me just tell you something about the line, it was all people over the age of 35. Some guy who was in his late SIXTIES was giving my friend the eye, literally just staring at her while licking his lips, and she called him out about how creepy it was. WTH are people that old doing out clubbing and eyeing under 25 chicks? Gross. 

So I was the first person to step into the club and I was ready to do a heel turn and walk right back out. This place looks like an ultra tacky bordello - everything is swathed in a red light and they had wreaths up for Christmas. As people filtered in, the staff told my group we could sit at any table we like and would only need to move if the people who paid the thousands of bucks showed up, then we could just move on to another table. Ha. Within three minutes I had been invited by two guys who bought a table to go hang with them at their table. When they told me they owned a small pharmaseutical company, I got up and left. Ugh, I loathe big pharma. 

----------------------------------------------------------
A longer-than-usual aside; somebody else on here gave the run down on flirting it up at the club, but let me break it down if you don't want to go in the ""gold digger club ho"" catagory. 

-Tryst's Web site posts the table layout of all the tables sold that night, included with what was paid for the tables. The room is broken up into VIP side / normal side so if you want to up your chances of getting asked to join a table, head to the right side of the room (VIP) - this is where the $5,000 and $7,000 table(s) are located. The more expensive tables decrease your chance of running into the obnoxious bachelor parties.

- The best thing to wear is a confident, not haughty, attidude. Act like you own the building and you'll be able to have your pick of whomever you like to speak or dance with. 

-Don't dress like a prostitute. It's desperate and crass. There's no need to have a centimeter of clevage hanging out nor any leg showing if you want people to notice you. I always go clubbing in leggings and a shirt that is either long sleeved or 3/4 sleeved and my boobs never hang out, yet I don't have a problem getting hit on, table invites, drink offers, calls the next day, whatever. 

-Already have a drink that you got comped or bought yourself. Don't whore yourself out for a $12 sub-par drink. Guys won't worry about you talking to them soley for a free drink. Ditto if you're invited to a table; don't take any drinks that you didn't buy yourself. You don't want to look like a chick who is there for the free booze.

-Don't do the lesbian kissing/grinding crap if you're not a lesbian. Again, be confident, not slutty and desperate. 

-Dance by yourself at times, or with a bunch of guys - you can't always get approached if you're part of the pack or hanging on some dude all night. 
----------------------------------------------------------

Anyway, after leaving the pharma guys, my friends and I posed on the stripper pole and spun around it (not like some pro or anything, just being silly.) We made it over to the dance floor and oh Lord, horrific. Tons of cougars and old guys. One guy was wearing DENIM ON DENIM. Who wears that to a club?! There were old (50's) guys in Hawaiian shirts and... thanks to the Wrangler Rodeo Finals, a TON of coyboys acting a fool on the dance floor. I thought I left that crap behind when I moved out of Oklahoma, but alas, I did not. The dancing I saw was really bad - I think people have forgotton how to sway their hips and instead it's this spastic rolling imaginary dice and stuff. I think the cougars were the worst because I don't want to see people older than my parents dancing like ho's and making out on the dance floor, in very awkward ways. Bleh. 

The music was awful. I don't want to dance to Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Journey, or any other music that would be on one of those ""Playing music from the 80's, 90's and today"" stations that is forever tuned into at every dentist and doctor's waiting room. I want to dance. I want to hear Chris Brown, TI, Lil' Wayne, Drake, Keri Hilson, etc. I want to hear the good stuff! The only time we all got down was when my birthday song, September, by Earth, Wind and Fire came on for 45 seconds. What is with the playing of the chours only? It blew. 

Anyway, after dancing and talking with some guys, I was so ready to leave. This place just was not my scene. At 12:08 AM, I was outta there, never to return again. Free doesn't get you five stars in my book."
OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,"Groupon found me another gem! I've been in dire need of a haircut for months. The last time I let a professional cut my hair, she cut 6 inches off, saying that my split ends justified that length. I don't know about you, but I've never seen a split end even close to as long as the length of my pinky nail, let alone 6 inches. I was ticked. I've let my sister trim my hair, but again, she had cut off 4 inches & I was not happy. I wanted a micro trim & I wasn't about to let another lazy stylist chop all of my hair off. 

I've had expensive cuts & free cuts, & I can honestly say, I had one of the best hair experiences yesterday (3/2/12) at Aspen. I started by calling to make an appointment, as directed by Groupon, prior to purchase. I believe Paul answered the phone & told me that they'd honor the Groupon Now special, without me purchasing a Groupon. I scheduled my appointment for a few hours later, at 1:30 PM.

At my appointment, I wasn't sure who was supposed to be working on me. The receptionist told me the girl that would work on me was finishing somebody else up & would be with me shortly. Eventually a different girl, a blonde girl (24, forgot her name) led me to the sinks for a deep condition. She was totally friendly & we had a nice chat. Afterward, she set me under a hair dryer for half an hour. My hair was very wet & it probably could have used a good squeeze because it was pretty drippy in the hair dryer. Regardless, this was not in any way a deal breaker.  

Afterward, Chirin told me she'd be working on my haircut. She was awesome & totally understood how I felt about not getting my hair chopped to bits. I asked for a micro trim & a few long layers. My hair tangles like nobody's business. Chirin started to brush my hair wet & it tangled! She switched brushes & told me that she wanted to cut my hair dry to be more precise because my hair was tangling . She blow dried & flat ironed it & gave me exactly what I wanted. Although she's almost 22, she'd been doing hair for 3 years & did a great job. I walked out with super shiny, soft SPLIT END free LONG hair! 

The Groupon deal was $20 for a conditioning treatment, cut & style. I couldn't have been more happy. I used my debit card & paid $25 (including tip.) I saw that they had a sign for $40 facials for first time clients. Because I had to be at work in an hour, I asked if I could schedule for tomorrow (3/3/12)  I was told to leave my number & somebody would call me to schedule. About 45 minutes later, Cati called & scheduled me for 2:30 on 3/3/12 (I didn't know Cati was the skin care specialist.) 

I showed up today (3/3/12) for my appointment. I said I didn't know who I was scheduled with. Chirin was at the front desk & a man said I was probably with Julie but he had to check. I was actually with Cati, which was fine by me. A guy in the waiting room was RAVING about the service here & about Cati's facials. He told me he & his wife travel from Milwaukee to their 2nd home here in Vegas, just to get worked on at Aspen & that Cati was amazing. 

I've never had a facial or any spa treatment, for that matter, so I wasn't sure what to expect. It was awesome. First I was led to a little room to change into a wrap, & then had my hands dipped into lavender paraffin wax, bundled up & put under comfy blankets. The room was dark & there was nice music on as Cati examined my skin & told me I had extremely dry skin. 

My problem area is my chin & neck. Cati told me I was having allergic reactions to my makeup & that I needed to get something organic, preferably mineral makeup ASAP, along with some OTC eczema cream for a spot that had reacted to my foundation. She told me I needed to stop using Clinique, Covergirl & RImmel because it was causing my current reactions. She also told me that the pharmaceuticals I've taken could easily be the culprit for some of my skin issues that she told me absolutely could not have been brought on by the use of topical product. She told me I needed more vitamin B in my diet, less scrubbing & to make sure my face was free of processed makeup. Along with a zillion other helpful tips, she did some extractions on my face. I'll be honest, I wish she had done a bit more extractions on my nose, but that's neither here nor there.

After 90 minutes of having my face steamed, extracted, cleaned with glycolic acid, then massaged (from my scalp to my arms!) & another mask, my treatment was over. I felt great! I was nervous when Cati said she was an independent contractor & that she took cash or check only because I had only brought my debit card. She ended up letting me use my debit card, with a $3 processing fee which brought my total to $53 for the facial (including $10 tip & fee.) I wish somebody would have mentioned her cash only policy when I scheduled as the policy wasn't the same for my hair cut the day before. I would have brought my checkbook. Regardless, I'm pretty sure that I'll be back for another facial & trim in a month."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"When I visit a restaurant, select a dish of my preference, and the dish arrives hot and tasty, I am a happy camper.  My selection was the Seafood Bayou with tilapia and shrimp both grilled to perfection.  The steaming hot entree was served over Tavern Rice with a side of fresh fruit that was absolutely delicious.  Being in a Tavern, I had to order something to drink.  I opted for the hard apple cider which tasted pretty much like an apple martini with a bit less punch.  It was quite tasty and I had to remind myself to sip rather than drink!  For dessert, the chocolate cake sounded delicious but I could not stuff any more into my mouth.  Although I drive by regularly, I had forgotten Hickory Tavern was at this location.  I enjoyed my meal and anxiously look forward to my next visit.  This lunchtime visit was superb.  

I almost forgot to talk about the sweet potato fries!  They are fabulous with honey drizzled on top (or you can have it on the side)!  If you are not afraid of something that tastes good, give them a try.

NOTE:  Since the hubs and I had the kids with us, an evening meal in a Tavern would have been out of the question."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"The service and staff at Dr. Haigney's office are great.  They were sure to explain the details of my daughter's surgery for the extract of four wisdom teeth.  Initially, I found it odd that a plastic surgeon was also an oral surgeon but there were no issues.  While the uncovered portion of insurance is payable in advance of surgery, my dental Insurance was processed without issue .  She was in and out of the office within 2.5 hours max.  Dr. Haigney called the next morning to check on her status. As a mother, T]this made me feel really good.  If there were any issues with my daughter, I would have been able to address them with him directly.  However, she had no issues.  Her pain today (2 days later) is minimal and she had a cheeseburger today.  It was great to see take 30 minutes to eat a meal; I hope this tradition continues. :)

As with all dental surgery, know that you will have prescriptions to drop off and pick up immediately after to ensure the minimum pain level is maintained on behalf of the patient.  This was not the case for me personally (with a surgeon in Greensboro) but is specifically important when your wisdom teeth are extracted."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"This place was jumping around 4PM on a Saturday afternoon.  The inside and drive through were lined with patrons and cars.  I quickly noticed the age of the building both outside and inside.  It is definitely in need of a major upgrade, but considering the constant flow of customers, this would be a major task.  In any case, the line flowed pretty quickly.  I told myself that if all of these people could enjoy ice cream on a warm afternoon, I deserved to do the same!  The M&M Blizzard is my staple and that's what I ordered.  For another person in my party, I requested and paid for extra toppings for her blizzard but when I received it, the extra toppings were not there.  Fortunately, I asked the server before grabbing my bag and he quickly added the extra per my request.  The little one ordered the $5 meal special with a big cheeseburger, fries, and a drink at the suggestion of the server.  She was quite pleased with her meal.

Other than the dated furnishings of the restaurant, the ice cream and food items are still popular.  They have plenty of extra parking spaces as well.  I have no complaints about the food or ice cream served at this location."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I was looking for a place to wash my dog.  Through Yelp, I found Lucky Dog Bark & Brew.  For $20, he would get washed, dried, ears cleaned, and nails trimmed.  The opened at 10 and we were on the schedule for 10.  The parking lot was huge and I was pleasantly surprised at the spacious interior.  Not only do they groom pets and provide daily and overnight accommodations, it is a pet-friendly bar!  There are wide open spaces inside, comfy sitting areas, and the traditional bar.  There are run areas for the dogs inside and outside.  I was given the lay of the land in response to my myriad quesitons (of course).  There were dogs inside and outside in the run areas having fun, barking at one another.  I would need to visit at a busier time to give the business 5/5 stars.  In addition, I returned early to retrieve my pooch because I didn't want to go all the way home and then have to turn around and come right back.  They sort of rushed him out to accommodate my scheduling.  He was still a little damp.  The next time he is in dire need of an immeidate bath, I will definitely give Luck Dog a call and let them have all the time they need to completely finish the job."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"Unfortunately, I am downgrading my review of the restaurant.  After reviewing their Queens Feast menu, I quickly made a reservation and upon arrival, was seated promptly.  We were given the standard menus.  I had to request a Queens Feast menu.  Later, I heard the waitress at the table next to us describe the contents of QF menu to the incoming customers.  Jealousy set in immediately.  My waitress was somewhat inattentive esp. since the restaurant had few customers between 3-4 on a Sunday afternoon.  We had to wait for her to return to our table a few times.

Back to our meal, I ordered:

- Drumheller Cabernet Sauvignon:  a nice blend that is easy on the palate.  Went very well with my meal.
- Deviled eggs (our creamy homemade mixture garnished with parsley): \not as creamy as described.  My photo shows all.
- Maryland-Style Crab Cakes (two jumbo lump crab cakes served with a whole grain mustard sauce with grilled asparagus): these were light and flavorful.
- Brownie a la Mode: dessert was presented exactly as shown on the QF website.  It was delightful!.

I will return to 131 Main some months from now.  Hopefully, service will be much better than it was today."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I had the pleasure of dining at Boiling Pot during their soft opening.  There were some tweaks yet to be ironed out but overall, it was a surprisingly pleasurable experience. All of the staff on hand were attentive and eager to ""get it right.""  We enjoyed a nice glass of wine (short on time) that was well presented at our table prior to serving.  The concept is fondue but if I recall correctly, the food is much better than the other restaurant of the same type.  We ordered the standard portion with chicken broth and Szechuan for our boiling pot without any extras (they were definitely not needed).  The broth was full of flavor.  We had plenty of food to fill our hungry bellies.  The staff explained the concept and how to manage our meal which was easy enough.  I particularly enjoyed dinner as the place was not crowded.  My guess is that with all of the tables filled and the bar seating filled, it would be loud and there would be a lot going on.  I would expect my next visit to prove this to be the case.  I look forward to visiting with the kids for a healthy meal with plenty of veggies.  I truly hope they keep the restaurant going strong so that patrons will want to return again and again."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"We drove past this establishment on our way to Gastonia and decided to make a stop on the way back.  This was within our realm of possibilities because we were on spring break.  To my delight, it was Ladies's Night so our visit was offered at half off range and firearm fees.  For less than $22 my daughter and I shared a lane and equipment.  We actually had enough prior to the end of our hour so we ended a bit early.  This included ear protection (2), goggles (1), and a box of 50 rounds.   This was my first time at a shooting range so after the introduction video and getting setup, I put my target at 15 yards (not all the way back).  They advised that beginners typically begin (I am guessing) a lot closer, say 5 yards.  That seemed way too close but I will pull it in on my next visit.

Notes:  
- Ladies' Night is Wednesday but we arrived before 5PM and received the discount. They led me to believe that it is an all day special.  Confirm before arrival.
- Kids are allowed to shoot at the discretion of the adult.  My 14 year old has long wanted to shoot so I allowed her to participate.  She seemed un-phased but afterward, told me she was shaking. She came, she did, and she is done for a while."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"Looking for something to eat after visiting UPS in this area, we settled on Floyd's.  I had heard of the restaurant but had never visited and was unaware of its location.  After all, American soul food is a good bet to fill an empty stomach.  The restaurant was clean (an employee began to clean up more as I waited).  There was a steady flow of customers as well.  I settled on baked white meat chicken, a couple wing dinners, and a kids' shrimp dinner.  I was immediately informed they were out of shrimp.  Then, after about a 15 minute wait, I was informed they were out of the baked white meat chicken.  Since they were out of my other staple, shrimp, I had to settle for chicken wings as well.  30 minutes later, the food was ready and I was on my way.  The chicken wings were small but tasty.  I also had cabbage (2/5), greens (4/5), sweet potatoes (5/5).  Although I am partial to sweet potatoes, they were indeed scrumptious.  The meal is served with two sides and a slice of cornbread (daughter LOVED it).  Overall, the food was good although service was slow (to cook the chicken).  I think I would have been out in 15-20 minutes if the order taker didn't forget they were out of baked white meat chicken."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I am at the dance studio next door at least twice a week.  I decided I really needed my nails done so why not try the salon next door.  It was a bit odd at first.  I thought, what is that loud music and noise coming from next door.  Then I realized it was the dance studio.  The sounds probably create a constant ambiance for the salon.  In any case, I got the $30 mani-pedi, which is exactly what I needed.  After reading the previous review, I was very cautious.  The service was great (not expert), but definitely satisfactory.  The staff cackled quite a bit in their native language, but they often included me in the conversation (in English, of course) especially when commenting about what we were seeing on the television.  My polish was something new they had in the store (on the front counter) and it has not chipped, and I am pretty hard on my nails.  My suggestion is to bring your own polish because salons have been known to add alcohol or perhaps water to the polish when it becomes old and they can't get it out of the bottle.  That is probably what happened to the first reviewer.  I am hoping for continued great service since I will be sitting around during the week, waiting for my daughter to finish dancing."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"It has taken too many years for me to visit this Greek-run restaurant.  I kept seeing it listed in the local newspaper and had to look up the location.  I  determined I had seen the restaurant when visiting Sangum Indian Cuisine.  The ad said they served breakfast all day so I made a mental and written note.   There were never many cars on that side of the parking lot but they were open and I said let's go.  It was early afternoon and we still wanted a breakfast meal.  We arrived at Cookhouse and again, there were few cars in the lot on their side.  We were greeted promptly and seated by a window.  There were a few tables of hungry patrons.  We ordered breakfast and it came fairly quickly.  I ordered the All American Combo with two eggs your way, two pancakes, and bacon ($6.49) - see photos.  That was all I needed.  We dove in and were quite pleased with everything we ordered.  I also ordered a side of apple sticks and they tasted just like dessert!  They would be really yummy with ice cream on top, but I digress.  All in all, this is a great place for breakfast any time of the day.  The overall menu is varied, like a diner.  Even if I am not interested in breakfast, I will definitely stop by Cookhouse for another meal."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I found my dentist of 15+ years!  Dr. Sandra Simmons-Boyd is now at DentalWorks.  I dreaded having to find a new dentist after she sold her practice but I recently experienced some tooth pain.  It was expected since my filling came out many weeks prior.  When I woke up that Thursday morning with the pain, I knew I had to see a dentist.  I was about to visit a new facility (after checking the great reviews on Yelp) when I heard from Dr. Boyd.  They were able to see me that afternoon and the root canal was scheduled for the following week.  Dr. Boyd will tell you that I don't like having my mouth numbed for dental work.  However, after fretting over having to find a new dentist, I have to give credit where credit is due.  Dr Boyd knows what she is doing and I am so glad that I found her.  Dental work is not painful esp. when you have staff who know what they are doing.  Dr. Boyd and her assistants explained everything that was to happen and answered my two questions.  Everyone was nice and warmly welcomed me to the practice.

As I mentioned in my tip, I did a quick price check for someone without dental insurance and found the cost at DentalWorks was above the cost at the other facility.  However, since my dentist is here, I am here."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I am pleased to give this theater 5/5 stars!  Admission - To bring me in, they offer admission specials on Mondays and Wednesdays (less than $5) and $5.25 admission all day on Tuesday.  I was so excited, I didn't ask about the rest of the week.  However, the price of $8.50 is less than I pay at home.  I was able to see a new movie of my choosing from the 16 available.  Concessions - they offer daily specials here as well.  One was a medium drink and small popcorn for $7.  These are prices I love!  I will say the flow of conessions is a bit odd so if this is your first time visiting the theater, give yourself extra time to get through here as the registers are abscured from view.  Theater - the rocking leather seats are very comfortable.  They may be slightly more spacious than regular theater seating and you may still experience some kicking behind you (nip it in the bud early).  The sound was great as was the view.  Overall, the theater was clean and the staff were attentive.

I read another view that said the seating was not as nice as other theaters in Las Vegas.  I have not visted any other theater and write this review based on my overall theater experience in the Charlotte area and this theater gets my vote for one of the best!"
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"It has been a year or so since I visited this cafe.  I don't have lasting memories of that visit recalling only that the food was okay.  It is nowhere on my daily travels and I had not returned until today.  Yes, the place is quaint, but only three tables were occupied on this evening during a drenching thunderstorm.  In any case, I stopped in today for sushi and ordered:

1. Vegetable tempura (deep fried sweet potato (MY FAV!), zucchini, broccoli and potato)
2.  Favorite Roll (crispy jumbo shrimp, spicy snow crab, avocado soybean paper with a spicy flavored mayo sauce)
3. Chicken tempura

The sushi was fantastic!  I am a sweet potato lover, so the vegetable tempura with a bit of crunch was delicious (am I partial?...yes!).  The chicken tempura was good, and my favorite seafood roll was pretty darn good as well!  I will be back very soon to give it  another try.

Oh, and I also had Miso soup.  I have read of its 'healing' properties so I wanted to give it a try.  Oddly enough, my visit was Monday and I was pretty sick and stuffy on Tuesday :(  Maybe just a coincidence...  

If you haven't visited the restaurant in a long while, give them another try. Perhaps the sushi chef has changed.  If not, my taste buds have changed for the better!"
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I visited The Range At Lake Norman after purchasing a Groupon. They have about 15 stalls which I imagine, can get very loud when full. I opted to insert earbuds​ before placing the sound gear over my ears. This helped quite a bit, although it prohibited conversation. With my shooting partner, we almost had the range to ourselves until a few guests showed up while we were being oriented via the standard video. With the rules and regulations under our belt, we were offered an arm, a 9mm which I had shot previously. My guess is this automatic weapon is definitely​ up to my standards. Once we acclimated to the range, our target set, we struggled with loading the weapon. Adam came in with an automatic thingy that helped us load the bullets swiftly. Now we were set to shoot. While Adam gave detailed instructions to my shooting partner, I listened intently so that he wouldn't have to repeat himself over the bullets propelling into targets. Once we were over the sudden shots being fired, we were able to settle down and get in some practice. I actually shot very well, according to Adam and the other two patrons. They even encouraged me to join a competition. In any case, I enjoyed my time at the range, given the direction of Adam. I will definitely visit again."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I heard there weren't a lot of wings to taste last year (I didn't attend). That friend was W-R-O-N-G! The only thing I didn't like was the wait outside in the new cold weather for the top of the hour. Many Yelpers like to be early. Fortunately, they started right on time early and got us in fairly quickly. There were wings galore! There were drinks galore! After being outside for a while, I came back in and bumped into the man of the hour, Stephen Smith, himself. After a quick hug, chat, and photo, I left him to the visit with other Yelpers. I was honored to be in attendance to support the Steve Smith Family Foundation. Let me tell you, some of the wings were awesome and some, not so much. I had to stop eating which meant I was unable to try them all. One that stands out in my memory is Hickory Tavern (surprise). They came through with three winners, all paired with a side (servings to taste)! All three offerings were very tasty without an overabundance of hot sauce.

Shout out to Nikki for another great event!
Shout out to Cheerwine and Tito's for great drinks!
Big shout out to ShutterBooth for fun photos we could take home!

The DJ, the staff and workers on site were all engaged to ensure we had a great evening and I did. I cannot wait until next year as I will be better prepared (stomach and notebook)!"
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I visited LNC for a wine tasting sponsored by Jazz Diva Events.  What a pleasant surprise!  The place has a whimsical feel with a wide assortment of wine accessories for sale that provide decoration until sold.  The evening was lovely, as was the view of the lake.  LNC was reserved for our event which made it more intimate as people were not coming and going.  There are five rooms available for seating with tables/chairs, sofas, and comfortable sitting chairs.  The tasting included five wines (two white, three red) with a 2.5 oz pour (about 2 glasses total) with a tapas and small plates (appetizer, entree, and dessert).  If you really didn't like white or red, you could stay with the color of your preference. The music system was set to an appropriate level so that conversations could be held at a normal tone. Although there was a musician present to play for the event, I was not able to hear him as he was set up in the front room.

I am giving the Cottage five stars because the ambience, service, wine, and food was delightful and price was affordable, even on the lake!  The servers were pleasant and knowledgeable about the wines being served.  In addition, their merchandise prices are comparable.  LNC is a great place to host a girls get together or a small gathering for friends.  I am already looking forward to my next visit to LNC."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I will begin with the phone call to make reservations.  I was asked if I was familiar with the dress code.  Being tolerable, I said no.  She proceeded to inform me what was not allowed...sagging/baggy pants, jeans, athetic apparel and so on and so on.  I was no longer listening.  I was also informed that there was a 15 minute grace period for arrival.

In any case, my dinner date with the hubs was quite nice.  After reading some of the reviews, I found the wait staff to be attentive and professional.  Since we were on a tight time schedule before the Esperanza Spalding show, we ordered wine (decent selection), appetizer (duck spring rolls - not bad at all), and or meals all in one fell swoop.  My entree consisted of three vegetables (as always, I wanted to eat what I ordered) consisting of yams (sweet potatoes, of course) which were delightful, mac & cheese (not bad and great with the Red blend), and cabbage (never again!) - see photo.  *I am teetering on 3.5 stars out of 5.*

Overall, my first was not bad at all.  The bar area was much more popular than the dinner side of the restaurant.  They had a nice band playing jazz music (with a violinist; a style similar to Michael Ward and Ken Ford).  Deltas still had the new 'place to be' atmosphere.

I will certainly give Deltas another try in the near future - hoping for improved Yelp ratings."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I was excited for weeks about this visit Outback for a Yelp event.  I had dismissed the chain from my list of favored restaurants when they got rid of Toowoomba Pasta many years ago.  That left sweet potatoes as my only option on the menu.  Mind you, I never ordered steak when eating out as it was never cooked to my liking, until recently.  This location presented an opportunity to visit during soft openings.

Back to my long-awaited visit to Outback.  We were a party of 30+, a fete not easily managed.  We served a portion of menu items including:

Aussie Bloom:  Topped with fries and sirloin = 1/5
Aussie Cheese Fries (not for me):  3/5
Mixed veggies: zucchini, squash, and carrots = 5/5
Sirloin:  Sliced prior to serving (rare) = 2/5
Grilled Shrimp = 2/5
Lobster Tails:  perfectly cooked = 5/5
Salmon cakes served with mixed vegetables = 4/5
Lemonade:  1/5 
Chocolate Cake:  Lush deliciousness! 5/5
Boomerang Beer Flight (paired with foods). I am not much of a beer drinker but I appreciate the effort = 3/5
Blackberry Sangria = 4/5

Given the above, I would opt for a lobster tail, sweet potato, and grilled veggies.  For dessert, I would definitely go with the chocolate cake.  As the menu is not a la carte, I don't plan to visit Outback anytime soon.  However, I may make an exception for a late night snack of chocolate cake with a nice glass of wine!"
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"Research on Yelp goes a long way to getting your money's worth!  I found this business and read each and every review.  The only thing that slowed me down what the indication that it was a home-based business.  Not to be deterred on my new menhadee craze, I emailed back and forth with Naseera for a few days before we could settle on a date and time. Her place wasn't hard to find.  She needed extra time to finish up with another new client who was having both hands/arms done.  The conversation was great so I was patient.  She started on me right after finishing up with the other client.  I showed her what I liked in a couple photographs in the book she provided.  We talked about what I did and didn't like.  After seeing her work, I told her to do what she felt best.  After explaining the materials used and answering my questions about her background and experience, she set to work without hesitation.  I timed her and she was done free-styling my hand/arm in 15 minutes!  See my photo for a glimpse of her amazing talent!  To top off the great work, the price is affordable.  I will definitely visit Naseera frequently.  This is a great alternative for me as I am not set on having the same tattoo in place for the rest of my life. Naseera has been doing this for 3/4 years.  She used to do menhadee for family and friends in India.  Oh, and she will come to your party!"
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"After reading reviews on Super G, I knew it was only a matter of time before I stopped in.  I had in mind that I would visit the restaurant in the back to get some soup.  As I walked through the store, the aromas certainly caught my attention.  I could not decode them.  Some were interesting while others more pungent.  I perused a few isles and came upon the myriad fresh vegetables.  It was then I decided a cart was in order.  I made a note of the vast array of fresh fruits and vegetable to look them up before purchasing; specifically, jack fruit, napa, batata yams, and rooster fries.  I am a sweet potato lover, so I am going to investigate the batata yams first!  I picked up a few items including chicken livers and mussel meat.  I just looked at the whole octopus, pork maws, pork tongue, and beef lips.  SMH.  Not today!  Some of the grocery items of interest to me were written in a language I could not understand, thus, I have to give them 4/5 stars.

In back, my nose followed the baking section.  It was after 7 pm, so I ""window shopped"" this area several times before moving on.  I looked at the food bowls but wasn't that hungry.  I settled on a small bowl of wonton soup that was flavorfully spicy and fragrantly appeasing.  It was VERY good and hit the spot of my stomach that sought satisfaction!  

I look forward to visiting Super G more often to find those things you just won't find anywhere else, like buffalo meat!"
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I visit Super G often but this restaurant is usually closed when I do. I was finally able to make it shortly before they closed at 7:30 PM. I ordered Jampong (Korean noodles with seafood) The order was ready in less than 10 minutes while I perused the supermarket. Upon arriving home almost an hour later, I split the soup as it was too much for me to eat at once. It was still warm. The noodles were separate from the seafood and soup, and condiments (kimchi and another I don't know the name of) were on packaged on the side. Let me say, the soup was delicious with a bit of a bite. The amount of seafood was ample. I found myself eating something that looked like a creepy crawler. It was tasty. But, when I came across the second one, I opted out. Overall, I was very happy with the amount of seafood included. The soup was absolutely delicious and exactly what I was hoping to receive upon visiting the restaurant. When I ate the remainder the next day, it was still delicious. The only part I didn't enjoy was the large prawn with whiskers and eyes intact​. It was probably delicious but I opted to leave it alone (see photo). There are many options on the menu to select from including soup bowls with a fried egg on top (these are best eaten immediately after preparation). The restaurant area in back of Super G had a good mix of patrons all enjoying their hot food. Count me in for another visit the next time I am in Southeast Charlotte."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"The cafe has moved to a new location, 8432 Old Statesville Avenue, right off of West Harris Boulevard.  The owner said this location provides a much bigger kitchen.  All cupcakes are made fresh daily.  Those that go unsold for the day are donated to a charitable organizationWe stopped by before dinner so the lemon lime and chocolate cupcakes and the banana and tangerine cake balls have not yet been eaten.  My daughter could not wait and thoroughly enjoyed a cookies and cream cake ball on a stick!  Each day offers a large variety of cupcake flavors.  The cafe makes vegan and gluten-free cupcakes as well.  Today, I tasted the peach cobbler yogurt.  It was divine!  Non-dairy yogurt (made right in the store with fresh fruit) is available 2-3 days a week.  The key-lime flavor was sold out :(.  You cannot go wrong when visiting this very nice cupcake shop.  Soon, they will have a small room available for birthdays (cupcake - decorate it yourself, yogurt, and drink for each party member).  Can't wait for that - the kids will have a blast!  East Boulevard's loss is my gain!

I agree with some of the reviews that all of the cupcakes may not actually be fresh.  However, I will note that my extremely finicky daughter just had a strawberry vegan cupcake (non-dairy, no wheat-based products, tofu...) which she found to be delicious!  That said, Divine is definitely worth another trip in the near future.  That said, I am reducing my 5 stars to 4."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"On my many visits back to this location, I always get irritated when an appointment time is not honored on their part.  Why make the appointment if you are not going to stand by it.  The process and price of the contact lens exam was acceptable but they won't release the prescription until she learns to put them in and take them out.  She's got a year to do it before she will need another exam but I hate going back for those training appointments.  The staff members are cordial, don't get me wrong, but I don't sense they are trained to honor appointments.  The patrons coming in for eyeglasses seem to have a much better experience when picking up their lenses.  Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury.  My suggestion is to bring your patience and something to read while you are waiting because that you will definitely do when you visit.  Another tip is to go in on a weekday before 5 pm and you may have an even better experience but I cannot promise you that.  Although this is a lower cost eye care chain, I still expect excellent service.  Oh, they have two chairs in the front of the store for waiting customers, that's because they pile you up in the rear waiting room while you wait for an exam.

I am giving them 2 stars for the staff but the business gets only only 1 star for service.  I am rounding up to 3 and that is really being generous.  Yes, I will go to Target next year where they always treat her like a princess.  We just need to plan ahead."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"This local establishment opened March 24, 2012.  I just noticed it while driving by on my way to Taylorsville.  Of course, I had to stop by on the way back and was not disappointed.  I stumbled across black cherry ice cream.  This is a flavor from way back in the day when there were just 12 or so flavors.  It was a absolutely delicious!  I should not have had it, but i couldn't help myself after a taste.  This brought back fond memories of having ice cream with Mom.  After describing the experience to her on the phone, she said she could taste it!  She is looking forward to another trip to NC.  In any case, I am going to stop by Cookies N Cream again today but I may be strong enough to leave with just another 'taste' of the black cherry and no more.  However, I sincerely and enthusiastically look forward to another serving of this wonderful ice cream flavor.  

Back to the restaurant, they have a few tables with checkers built into the tabletop.  These were primarily occupied by the kids.  There were plenty of other tables available but we chose to sit in the high stools and look out of the window.  This is a nice establishment and the staff members were kind and accommodating.  The owners said they wanted to open a local ice cream parlor and they have accomplished that task.  There was a steady flow of customers as well.  You won't be disappointed as they have numerous flavors of fresh ice cream; something to suit even the pickiest eater (crazy vanilla)!"
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I was going to skip the review of this restaurant as I only stopped here because my child was 'starving'.  There was one car at the window waiting for food and another one at the speaker to order.  I was glad this would not be a long wait.  I was wrong.  My child was 'starving' so I waited.  I waited at least 5 minutes before moving up (I did not check the clock).  When I got up to the speaker, I stated the order twice, a chicken tenders meal with sweat tea and a large fry.  I was asked for the yet order again.  After repeating it a third and fourth time, I finally got to move up to the window but had to wait a few more minutes for the car in front of me to move up while waiting for their order to be delivered from inside.  This guy didn't want to move up - I could not reach the window.  When Bonkiesha (her name is on the receipt) yelled at him to move up, he finally did.  Okay, so here's what I got... warm chicken tenders with warm fries and a Pepsi (vs. sweet tea) and the large order of fries was so cold, it was ridiculous.  Was I wrong to think they were cooking the food while I was waiting?  Yes, I was!  What makes fast-food restaurants think you want cold fries?  I mean really; I can get a frozen bag at the supermarket and throw them in the oven.  I was so disgusted, I pulled off with EVERY intention to never stop at this location again.  I thought the renewed energy of JCSU on this block would warrant an improved fast-food restaurant but that was wrong assumption on my part."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"I had to stop in to this bakery since they are in the same strip mall as Leap of Faith Dance Academy, where I am every week.  Although I had just eaten lunch/dinner, I purchased four cupcakes, vanilla, honey bun, and bubble gum x 2 with round gumballs on top.  The kids threw the bubble gum cupcakes down in a flash.  I shared the vanilla with some friends and they enjoyed it.  The honey bun was more like a cinnamon swirl and it seemed there was more icing than cupcake.  My tasting indicated the icing was tasty and the cake was not bad.  It was neither moist nor dry.  I will have to stop by one evening when I am hungry for something sweet so that I can get the full impact of their cupcakes.  I was told there was no discount for 1/2 dozen, however, upon checking out, I was given a card to buy 5 and get one free.  No, I was told, you have to use it on your next visit.  Fortunately, I plan to visit again so that I can use that coupon.  Oh, the cupcake shelves were almost empty.  I am pretty sure the patrons of the other establishments had already been in there (I saw them coming out with cupcakes) but indications were there were more cupcakes in the back if needed.  A pot of coffee was available to go with the cupcakes but it was too hot for that.

Only time will tell if this, the 3rd or 4th bakery I have noticed in this location, will survive the storm.  They will need to partner with neighboring businesses and more specifically the hotel next door to maintain a steady flow of customers."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"Thank you Yelp for the opportunity to participate in a VIP class tonight.  Traffic was a nightmare (coming from North Charlotte) and with the rain storm that rolled in, it got even worse.  I arrived about 15 minutes late for the 5:45 class and opted to wait to attend the 7pm class.  I am thankful it was offered.  This location is a partnership with the Midtown location - verify shared options in advance. The class was taught by Leila with her Hip-Hop flare.  She took us on a great ride with an all body workout!  After the workout, you can expect to receive your riding results as compared to others in the room - I am awaiting receipt of mine.

I am giving this location 4/5 stars because the fans in the room are geared towards the 2nd and 3rd row of bicycles (I was in the 2nd row).  They were too much for me.  Apparently, they are unable to turn off one - all are on one switch that is either on or off.  However, riding shoes (clip in) and towels are available at no charge, and water bottles were offered at the time of my visit.

Other than that, I strongly recommend you check out the Blast of free rides June 8 through 18th.  Rides are offered throughout the day.  If you are new to cycling, I strongly recommend you arrive early to receive an overview of the bike and learn how to set it up to your specifications.  Oh, more importantly, you must reserve your spot online in advance as walking in is are subject to availability.  

Note parking is scarce until the deck is completed.  

Enjoy!"
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"After reading previous reviews, I was not overly impressed by anything at Hasaki Grill on this quiet Friday evening.  The music was too loud and not because it was not my flavor.  The waiter, bless his heart, had no idea what to do or say.  He said too much but yet did not ask enough questions.  No water was offered, which I accept as the new ""thing"".  However, once he brought over the appetizers, he failed to bring plates, silverware, or napkins.  I applaud the business for creating jobs, but please know that you must provide minimal training.  It might help to send the staff to other establishments to see how it is or isn't done.  I am not going to knock him too bad for his lack of service because I am really happy he has a job, for now.  Moving on to the food, the shrimp appetizer was artfully arranged and the shrimp was tasty; however, we had to request silverware and ginger sauce to make use of the ample serving of lettuce and carrots that was served with the appetizer.  My entree, shrimp with broccoli (served with fried rice and sweet carrots) was nothing special.  The wine list is very limited and as expected, the waiter was unable to offer any suggestions as they had recently received their liquor license.  It is my guess that the Uptown lunch crowd may keep this restaurant in business as only two other tables were occupied in the tastefully decorated restaurant.  I will make another visit to Hasaki to check out the sushi - hopefully, it will not disappoint...and I will gladly update this review at that time."
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"Wow!  I was pretty hungry with no high hopes for lunch.  I checked the nearby restaurants on Yelp, of course.  First Watch popped up first and it took about 10 seconds for me to see that this was worth a shot. They were still open so I popped in the directions.  Three minutes later, I was there. The hostess told me it was a 15 minute wait but offered the ""bar"" seating.  This was a table that sat 10 people.  I sat and waited a few minutes while perusing the menu.  I was excited to be there.  When the waitress arrived, I ordered water and the Chicken Chimichurri Hash.  This was a limited time special and it quickly caught my eye.  The ingredients were two cage-free eggs (had to be over medium), atop fresh, seasoned potatoes tossed in Chimichurri sauce with all-natural chicken breast, Monterey Jack, house-roasted onions and kale.  The dish was served with whole grain artisan toast with all-natural preserves and fresh fruit.  Let me tell you, my eggs were perfect and my bar mate, Angela, and I had the same dish so we discussed it while we ate.  It was heavenly!  The bread was fresh and delicious. The preserves were mouth watering and the fruit, well, it was freshly prepared and simply divine.  I was elated to be in this restaurant to experience freshly prepared food.  The taste of farm-to-table quickly grabbed me in and I will jump at the opportunity to visit this restaurant again. I already know what I am going to order, unless they have another limited time special that trumps it. Can we please get one North of Charlotte?"
7PiRdxYF-Uvzn2fHqdtU1Q,"Topgolf is the place to have fun while hanging out with friends.  Upon arrival on a Saturday night, cars were parked on the side street.  I was fortunate to find a space there when a car pulled out.  After walking around to the front of the building, I saw there was a very long line of patrons waiting to get in.  A staff member who came around to answer questions of the patrons in line mentioned the line was to get a membership card, which is needed to participate.  If you already had a card, you could go ahead and get your name on the waiting list for a pod.  There were three registers open but it was taking a really long time to get individuals registered.  After getting to the front of the line (via friends in our party), our pre-reserved pod was ready.  It happened to be the one right in front of the lobby area.  No big deal as the music was so loud, nothing in the lobby got our attention.  The place was wild.  

There was one staff member, let's call her a guide, who came around to show us how to operate the computer, etc.  She said our waitress would be along shortly.  After a long while, I grabbed her to get the waitress and send her to our table.  Our table should have had six chairs but the pod people next to us took three of them for their party.  I had to convince the guide to get our chairs.  She couldn't do it and had to grab a manager.  He came by and got us three chairs from somewhere.  

Did I mention the music was really loud?  You had to yell at each other to conversate.  We finally got drinks and food.  The food is pretty good and the prices are reasonable.  I thought the price for the play time ($45/hour for the pod) was high but I don't know much about paying to play golf.  It was a lot of fun but I could have done without the really loud music.  Maybe it's not as loud on the higher levels. 

They also have a bar/restaurant area, and a DJ was upstairs playing in front of the dance floor.  If you want to hang out on a weekend night, this is a great place.  If you are serious about hitting golf balls, you definitely want to visit on a weeknight.  It's a great place for kids any day but the weekends are a bit much for the young ones."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"What a surprise!

Located between the Mandalay Bay and Luxor, this hidden gem is a must try. 

My friends and I stumbled in here after not being able to decide where to eat...

At the end of the night I think the quorum agreed it was an excellent decision.

After a day and part of the night full of drinking and gambling beer, wings and pizza was it for dinner.  

The wings were tasty, fresh and perfect with the side of ranch.  The Parmesan fries were good too! We shared two types of pizzas, the meat lovers as well as the chicken bbq. Both were delicious and were gone in minutes.

It was easy to decide what type of pizza to share and we all had a good time.

Food is reasonably priced and service is fast surprisingly good considering the time we came in.  

Our large group was seated in the rear where there were a few tvs. There was a display of old matches and old memorabilia/art of historic Vegas which I enjoyed. The place was comfy and accommodating.

If I stay at the Delano again, I wouldn't hesitate to dine here again.

Thanks Slice of Vegas for excellent food, service and pictures... you helped make a quick bachelors party memorable.

Cheers and see you all soon!"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"If you ever find yourself in the middle of the desert off the beaten path from Vegas, you need to stop by the Klondike Sunset Casino.

Parking is easy.  The lot is well lit and the staff are friendly and welcoming.

This is a non hotel casino that offers a bar, cafe, slots but no table games.  It is a small place that appeals to few locals and me.  

I popped in here with a buddy as we were on a quest to visit each casino that we haven't already been to.  This was one on the list. 

I liked the layout of the place.  The selection of slots was decent too.  There were only a handful of people in here, including staff which was perfect.  

I noticed it wasn't smokey at all, which is what you'd expect with a smaller casino.

There's a small sports betting area with huge Tvs.  They were showing old wrestling matches of Ric Flair. Wooooooooooooooooooooooo!

The cafe was closed off with chairs blocking access but apparently it was open.  You just have to order with the bartender. 

Made some money after a few minutes and was back on the road. 

Will probably be back again as we plan on visiting the Skyline and Jokers Wild Casino on our next trip.

Thanks Klondike Sunset Casino, be back soon."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"The only buffet option within the Suncoast Hotel. 

The dinner is reasonably priced if you're not particularly looking for something. 

Saturday night is prime rib and shrimp scampi. Not the greatest but not the worst either. 

The other stations are so so. 

If you have a comp then this would be four stars. If you had to pay, it's more of a two and a half but the service that you'll receive rounds it up to three stars and I feel that's fair. 

The plates are cleared the moment you're finished and the drinks are topped off. 

The dining area is comfortable. The seats and booths are well placed. 

The only thing that I didn't like we're the extendable dining tables as they were a bit wobbly and silverware kept falling.

The desserts were decent but not many options to choose from. 

The ice cream wasn't dryers which I prefer and the consistency wasn't right. It's probably their settings. I still finished it though. 

At the end of the day, what it came down to was I came in hungry and left full. 

I didn't feel like I had to stuff my face with everything to justify the cost of free and I left happy just in time to catch my free movie at the theater. 

I'll probably be back here again. 

Thanks!"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"When in Vegas, this club is a must! Be sure to secure either VIP tickets or Bottle Service or you'll never make it into the club unless you're a dime... 

The layout of the club is perfect to see or be seen. The DJ overlooks the crowd and reserved sections. 

Bottle service is worth it as drinks are pretty pricey and the wait to get in under general admission is extremely long. 

Once you're in, it's tough to find a spot if you don't have a reserved section... It's hard enough to head to the restroom and back to your section as it gets crowded and sticky. 

The atmosphere is fun and the smell is fresh as air is pumped into here constantly but keep in mind there will be a few people who don't shower or have severe cases of body odor... But hey it's Vegas. 

When the nights over, leave the place quick as ish always goes down here... Cop surround the place and tend to hit up the drunk and belligerent people who can't even keep their balance. This is actually the most entertaining part of the night. 

If it's a fight night UFC or boxing, good luck trying to get into the casino, yet alone the club. I suggest using valet or parking at Hooters and just waking across. You'll beat the traffic by waking."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Who doesn't love BBQ!?

Who doesn't love Asian Style BBQ!?

Who loves to pay CASH ONLY in a rated Top 100 Chinese Restaurant? 

Who doesn't like to fight for a parking spot and having their car dented by other patrons!?

This place came highly recommended from a friend whom I trust with places to eat.

As I entered, I noticed the food hanging in the display as well as other prepared items.  The smell was very welcoming.  I wanted to try everything.  It was one of those moments where my eyes were much hungrier than my stomach...  

We weren't too hungry and were actually planning on dining late late night afterwards so we decided to share a huge plate of combination fried rice and Roasted Duck as well as Pork.  They were both thinly sliced and sauced but prepared to perfection. Both were packed with flavor and very satisfying.

A side of two sauces were provided as well.  

The color selection for the walls were odd and unique but didn't bother me.

The dining area is laid out to fit the maximum amount of guests.

The service is great and quick.

I'd be back again in a heartbeat, if I have a craving for quality Asian BBQ. 

You have to try this place at least once if you're in Las Vegas.  

You can thank me later."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Whenever I visit Las Vegas, I make it a point to try a different restaurant.  I can always eat at the casinos for free but that too gets boring.  

My wife and I decided to make the short drive to visit Neighbors after a recommendation from our friend who was local.

The place is currently at a stand alone spot which is good in terms of parking.  Though it does get busy, there's tons of places to park.

The moment you walk in, you see who popular this place is.

I'm sure the majority of the customers that were in when I visited were locals but I could be wrong.

The smell of coffee was welcoming.

The layout of the dining area is perfect.  It allows rooms for people to eat comfortably, without banging elbows with their dining neighbors.

You order first then pick a place to sit.

Within minutes your food and drink are delivered to you.

There are several table options.  Small for a couple or large for a big group.

The food was really good and all natural.  The breakfast potatoes were surprisingly good too.

The portions are large enough to share if you get a plate.  

I'll probably be back again when in town.

Kudos to Neighbors for offering a new place to enjoy brunch.

Give them a try.  You can thank me later."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"If you don't want to deal with the crowdiness of the strip, Boulder Highway is a great option.

In my opinion Sam's Town is the best hotel choice.

The room that I stayed im was beautifully appointed.  Exceptionally clean and had a vaulted ceiling - which made it feel more luxurious.

Being on the highest floor made my sleep easy to come by.

I couldn't hear anyone over or next to me.

The view of the atrium was nice.  Much better than the outside.

The furniture pieces looked newer and the carpet as well as choice of wall paper/paint was very soothing.  Excellent choices by the interior design team.

The big screen HDTV was perfect.  Didn't have any lag or blur.

The overall layout was great. I definitely enjoyed my relaxed stay. 

Even though I'll probably continue to receive offers to stay in more popular hotels on or near the strip or even downtown on Fremont, I think I'll be staying here moving forward.

Sam's Town has the perfect formula and good mix of bowling, casino games, dining options and even a good sized movie theater - therr truly isn't a reason to wanr to go anywhere else! 

Win, lose or draw. 

Your money will last longer here.

Book a stay here for your next trip out to Vegas.

You can thank me later. 

Vegas Baby!"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Tucked away in the Arts District of Downtown Las Vegas is this wonderful gem.

Parking is scarce due to endless construction but if you get here early, you'll be able to park directly across the street.  

I brunched here with my wife, brother and sister in law during the weekend and was impressed with the restaurant. They serve Latin Style Hash, Empenadas and of course coffee/lattes. 

We were seated immediately and placed our order within 10 minutes.

Drinks came out quickly and food came out maybe 10 minutes after.

The ambiance is perfect for one on one conversations or large groups.  The decor is simple and eclectic. With patio seating, lounge seating and formal dining seating, this place has enough room for everyone. 

Our coffee/lattes were perfect in size and flavor. 

The service is prompt and friendly.  Drinks are refreshed, plates cleared and follow ups were frequent.

I'm glad my wife chose this place, as we were able to enjoy a delicious meal, lengthy conversation and a great place to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the Las Vegas Strip.

I'll be back for sure when we visit paradise again.

Kudos to Makers and Finders Coffee for providing a chill place to enjoy a chilled drink or two or three... Did I mention they also serve liquor!?"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Recently stayed at the hotel under a complimentary stay. Was in Friday the 23rd and checked out on the 25th. My final portfolio bill was $0.00! 

Within a few days I was charged $30! Apparently there was a room charge and tip that took place the following day after my check out. 

Keep in mind when I dine at their restaurant I use comps, also this weekend I did not dine in any of their establishments. 

Be cautious when checking out and beware of scammers. I believe this was an inside job from one of the front desk employees.

Though I have been a loyal customer to the Gold Coast, this type of shady practice is not acceptable. 

I expect that other hotel guests have had this happen to them too over their most recent visits. 

I want answers... Boyd Gaming is a publicly traded company and if this is or has become common practice within their properties, then they have a problem. 

With so many options to choose from in Las Vegas, from now on, I suggest staying elsewhere.

I'll add that during this trip I won in their casino so this review is in in no way, shape or form an attempt to get anything back. I just want the hotel to determine who did this fraudulent act and terminate the employee. As of today I've filed a claim with my financial institution and should have a solution soon."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Ok so I've been here several times over the past 20 years and I honestly have to say that the quality of food has declined. Honestly if I had to pay for a meal here I'd be very disappointed. It's overpriced and the service is so so unless you're in the VIP Section. The crab legs are served either steamed cold or pre sliced. The jumbo shrimps are no longer jumbo and the stations looked sub par compared to the rest of the strip hotels. Since Caesars offered the all day dining option for one price all their buffets have gone south... Sad to say. 

The lines were a bit long and weren't justified. I'm glad I didn't have to wait as I'm a diamond member and enjoyed the separate entrance and dining area. Our server was friendly and always topping off my party's champagne flutes (included with meal) for Platinum and Above members only. 

The prime rib wasn't prime rib! The top sirloin steaks were dry and had probably been sitting for a bit. 

The Asian station had good selection with a few dim sum options and the dessert section had delicious gelato. All in all, I have to rate this buffet a 3 star out of respect for the property and knowing how good it used to be. I'd be back again for sure if the meal is comped.  I can only hope they bring back the quality of food as they had back in the day!"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Bier is beer... not true!

Came here with a few friends to tilt back a few German beers.

We had a great time with the live entertainment and the food.

The crowd was very friendly and enjoying themselves.

You can actually have a great time in Vegas without gambling or clubbing.

From the live band to the chicken dance being performed by the crew... this place was hopping!  

Parking is easy but getting here and getting out is difficult as it is very close to the exit of the McCarran Airport. 

My favorite of all their beers is the Original.  It's very smooth and refreshing.

As for their food, their pretzel and bratwurst were the perfect combination.  The pretzel was heavily salted but I was able to offset it with the several dipping sauces.  The bratwurst was perfectly cooked and packed with flavor.

If you're into contests and love free beer, volunteer for their games!  You'll get a huge amount of beef for free, win or lose.

If you enjoy yourself, you can buy a little or big keepsake from their storefront. 

If you're looking for a place to celebrate any occasion or even get married, this is a great option.  They have a huge beer garden with a fountain as well as a patio.  

If you plan on drinking tons, be sure to take a taxi or uber. 

If you plan on driving, use Valet. 

Cheers!"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Came here one night a few weeks back as my wife has wanted to try it for years.

It's located in a nicer part of Vegas which is more upscale.  Their food and prices reflect this.

It's a great place to see and be seen if you know what I mean.  Most of the patrons were wearing some snazzy clothing and shoes but don't worry if you come in with short and flip flops, with the weather its understandable. 

The restaurant is large and even has a patio area but when we visited it was 115 degrees... no thanks.

We were seated in the main dining area which was just in front of the prep area... such a sight to see.  It's amazing to see their team work, it's really an art.  The food they create not only looks delicious, it tastes it too!

The decor inside does give a farm to table feel.  All the random mirrors and frames are unique and add a little color to the room.  

The place is spotless and very comfortable.  It's nice that they decided to have vaulted ceilings, it makes for a better dining experience. 

Now to the food and drink:

The mule was strong and flavorful. 

The appetizer that they provide with the spread is so good!  

The steak and veggies that I had were wonderful.

The dessert was on point. 

Everything was picture perfect and made fresh.

I can't wait to get back to Vegas to try more of their offerings."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Recently stayed here again and was happy I did.

Don't get me wrong, it isn't the Wynn or Palazzo but it was only a short walk away from those luxurious properties and casinos.

When choosing to stay at TI you know you'll be pretty much in the center of the strip and literally next to the mall.

Parking is free and pretty easy to find.  It is convenient to move in and out of the garage and entrances.  You can choose to get on to the strip or off strip to avoid traffic depending on what events are taking place while you visit.

There is an easy check in center just off the back entrance from the garage which is convenient.

The rooms are clean and most have a strip view.  Unless you get a suite the views will be limited to one window and you may have to stand in front of it to see the strip.  Lighting is not the best in the room as my wife mentioned as it is hard to put on makeup. 

The casino is spacious but does get crowded.  It is an older property so ceiling are lower than other mega resorts on the strip. You'll notice if you wnter from the garage that they have the older jumbo tvs that must be replaced ASAP!  

For the price I paid (nothing) plus free food and casino play, it was worth the visit.

TI knows how to take care of their casino players
and guests. I'll be back for sure.  Maybe during the summer. 

Vegas Baby!"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Used to come here every time I visited Vegas but somehow never left a review.  Back in the day I'd have a comp and always thought the food tasted much better when it was free or at least prepaid if you know what I'm saying... it is in the city of lost wages! 

Back in the day this place would be alway packed especially on a going home Sunday.  This time around my group of 10 were seated and served quickly.

The dim sum carts came by and we were eating almost immediately.  We were seated in a section with a TV which was great since we all had placed our sports bets and were anxious to see if we were going to enjoy a free or expensive meal. Lol 

The selection was endless and the freshness was obvious. From the xlbs to the Chinese Broccoli and even the chicken feet, everything was on point.

I noticed the steam coming off of each entree as the staff pushed along all the tasty options.

Eventually we had about 20 different items and the table started to look like an advertisement for the place with so much color.

With help of the lazy Susan my group came hungry and left happy without breaking the bank.

Let's just say my executive decision to have brunch here instead of at the buffet or even at hash house was the best decision of the weekend.

We were ready to head home after an epic bachelor party weekend.

I know I'll be back for sure when I visit again.

Thanks KJ see you soon."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Played and stayed here before and was thankful for my complimentary room.

It was a place to rest a bit before heading out again to enjoy the strip.

The shower was clean and had hot water... which at times isn't found at even some of the 4 or 5 star hotels.

The location is its selling point for people considering staying here.

My room was clean and had an awesome pool view which was perfect as they had a swimsuit competition the same weekend.

The AC worked though it was old.

My only complaint was the toilet didn't flush properly and wasn't bolted down completely, so imagine how much of a pain it was taking a number two... it literally was a balancing act.  Again, it was a free room ao no real gripe here. The room did need an update though.

On top of the free room I also got free play and a free meal.  It made dollars and sense to check in and check it out! 

It isn't the Cosmopolitan or Wynn but it also isn't a Motel 6. 

If you don't need all the glitz and glamour of the few posh hotels on the strip and also don't want to pay an arm and a leg, this should be in consideration for you. 

I haven't played here recently so the promos stopped coming in the mail so I haven't been enticed to visit. 

Staying most recently at the MGM Grand, I stumbled here to check out the new upgrades.

Looks decent.  I'm sure they've updated the rooms - at least I hope so. 

Viva Las Vegas Baby!"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Not the best but absolutely not the worst.

With the closing of the Cannery Row Buffet, this is the only one that I'd eat at on Boulder Highway.

The selection of food is decent. 

The food is fresh and replaced in a timely manner.

Service from cashier, host and server was excellent.

Came in for champagne brunch but passed on the champagne as I had already had enough to drink from the previous night lol.

The price point seems to be just right for most patrons as I overheard many guests mention it.

I agree as my meal was free.  Even if I had to pau for my brunch I wouldn't have been upset at all.

I also noticed there was a coupon available from the Sunday paper that locals were using, so if you're a local check out the paper to save some money that can be used on craps, blackjack or slots! 

The American, Asian, Italian and Mexican stations had adequate food options. 

I ended up just having bacon, eggs and salmon.  I did see that there was eggs benedict but I didn't try it on this visit.

I'll add the place was clean and well maintained.  

Tracy was an excellent server and was very welcoming.  

If I receive another offer to stay on this side of town, I wouldn't think twice about booking it to enjoy all the perks!

Thanks Sam's Town and Firelight Buffet... you've gained a new customer - who also happens to be a Yelp Elite! 

I'll help spread the word. 

Be back soon.

Vegas Baby!"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Been here a few times before and realized that I've never left a review! 

My most recent visit was great...

Had a cabana and shared with my friends which was a good and a bad idea... 

Make sure nobody in you're party is a professional skater if you catch my drift. 

Service was better this time around and our waitress was very accommodating, which deserved a decent tip. Even their security staff were friendly and welcoming. I had a few friends with intimidating tattoos that make them look tough lol. 

Our cabana was perfectly situated just below the stage perfect view to see and be seen.  Steps from both the stage and the pool as well as the restrooms and lockers. 

If you're debating about paying a cover or getting bottle service, service all the way. 

It helps if you're a hotel guest and a member of the armed forces... enough said.

If you are ballin on a budget, there are options available here too.

DJ Otto was spinning and kept the place moving all afternoon into sunset.

Drinks were perfect and all items were replaced and refreshed as needed.

We were able sip on some whiskey and smoke on Cohiba Cigars. Time and money well spent. Priceless! 

If you're looking for a place where you can relax with friends and not worry about being kicked by a kid, this is the place to be.

Don't get me wrong I love a lazy river and a beach wave but sometimes you need to live a little.

Be back soon! 

TTFN"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Didn't make it out to Church on Easter Sunday but I did make it to Church's Chicken... so that's close enough. 

Came in with my friend on our way home and were told they were out of chicken for 20 minutes.  

We waited patiently for our food to be prepared.  I noticed, the place wasn't running their AC, which made it a bit uncomfortable and there was no available seating outside, so we manned up and dined here.  At least they had ice available for our drinks, which made the situation manageable. 

When our food came out, my friend and I were pleased with the size and quality.  We had extra condiments as well as napkins, all were needed as their chicken has always known to be more on the greasier side... which explains the great taste. 

I had a four piece meal, fries and their famous honey biscuit.  I left full with extra money in my pocket which was a plus. 

This place needs to improve on inventory and put on the air conditioning.  Las Vegas is hot, granted it was the first of the month, April Fools, but don't mess or joke around with people's comfort when they are dining in your place. 

Kudos to the two member team that worked on Easter Sunday.  They were friendly, hard working and honest.  

I wouldn't hesitate to visit this place when I'm in town, since the food was good, hopefully, management will take my review into consideration and work on improving their establishment. 

See you in a few weeks."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Been coming here for years and have seen it deteriorate.

The rooms are still huge, clean and don't have any bed bugs but the hotel  needs and update.

The room I had smelled like weed and there was nothing the hotel could do about it.  They claimed to be fully booked.

I had a maintenance man come in and spray some sort of chemical to try and mask the smell... it worked for about an hour but it was still overpowered by the weed.  Either the person before me or the room next to me was on cloud nine.

I wasn't the only person who noticed it.  On multiple occasions, other guests were complaining in the elevator.

I'm not on here complaining because I want a refund.  If I wanted one, I would have requested it before checkout.  I didn't lose in the casino either, if that's what you're thinking.  I actually won! 

Wish, this place would turn around for the better but unfortunately, I think its just not in the cards.  

With no more masquerade show or even a shuttle to the strip, the perks of staying here no longer exist. 

It's a shame that a long time customer like myself is now forced to look for another place to stay and play. 

The hotel is aware of many problems but seem to do nothing about it.

Wide open water pipes leaking, broken elevators, empty casino, this place needs immediate help.  Caesars Entertainment should consider renovating this one time gem.  It would be a shame to see it close.  Too many memories here at the Rio."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Having just stayed for one and a half days, this place was perfect for what me and my friends needed.  

The room though a bit smaller than what I've been used to, is very clean and comfortable.  The carpet is updated and so is all the furniture.  Having a refrigerator in the room definitely helped.  Plus, the additional lounge chair and area, allowed just enough room for four dudes to catch some shut-eye.  

The restroom was tiny but very clean.  The fixtures looked old but you can tell there had been an honest attempt to freshen things up, as I noticed the quality wall paper that was probably put on within the last 5 years or less. 

I must add that staying on the VIP Level Floor (#10) was perfect as you I did not hear any noise from other guests.  The only issues is, that since you're right on Fremont Street, you will hear the music blasting from about 10am-2am.  

Remember to tip well as people work for tips in Vegas... ask and you shall receive. 

I enjoyed the freedom of being to be able to walk out of your room and only be a few steps away from all the action as well as the other Classic Hotels as the Four Queens, Golden Nugget and Binions.  

I'd definitely return again and stay here if I receive an enticing offers, which I'm sure I'll get as my buddies and I played a bit.  (We were actually pretty luck this trip!)

***Note there is no public garage parking!  You must valet!!!*** Don't worry though because the valet service is quick! Faster than the Flamingo!"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Harvest by Roy Ellamar is an interesting restaurant.

Located inside the Bellagio and steps from the observatory, this place offers delicious food and libations. 

Keep in mind if you're planning to dine here don't request a window seat as their isn't a view of the fountains, you'll just see people passing by.

The decor and ambiance is unique and welcoming. 

The open layout and kitchen will keep you intrigued I know I was.

My wife and I dined on a busy night but had a reservation. 

We ordered a cheese platter, pre fixe dinner and a seafood platter which was huge but it really shareable... could be perfect for someone looking for a seafood entree if steak isn't your cup of tea.

The cheese platter was definitely shareable. It's great for pictures and was tasty too.

The seafood platter had a good mix of clams, oysters, prawns and a Maine Lobster.

The pre fixe dinner was surprisingly delicious. It came out on several plates and was perfect for pics.  The turkey was flavorful and moist. The sides were tasty too. 

The dessert was on point. 

Seating arrangements are close so you shouldn't expect to have an intimate dinner.

They can seat one all the way up to 20 in the dining area but you'll want to have a reservation for sure as this place is very popular.

If you're looking for a place that isn't a buffet and want to be served, Harvest is an excellent option. 

You can come in with jeans and don't have to wear a coat but most of the guests that dined next to me were dressed to the nines."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"I can't agree with most of the reviews here. 

At $35 a person this isn't a value play but isn't a rip off either. 

I've been to many buffets in Vegas some good some bad and this one isn't bad.

Service was excellent from the cashier and host to the chef and server.

Tyler was very courteous and hard working. 

The dining area is spacious and very clean. 
Now to food. 

The selection is small but decent. I'd rather enjoy a few good options instead of many terrible tasting options! Am I right!? 

The prime rib was on point. I like how the carving station is available for you to choose whether or not to get a pre sliced service or to wait for the carver to do his or her thing. 

The peel shrimp, though small compared to what I've been used to consuming was fresh and tasty.

The dun-genus crab legs come pre sliced or pre cracked you can choose legs or claws.  They were tasty and quickly replenished when low.

I didn't try any of the other stations aside from the dessert and it was good. What I liked was that they used Dreyer's! There was mini churros and mini donuts as well as chocolate covered strawberries. I didn't see a chocolate fountain so I'm curious if these were brought it. Still good though.

 Now to the drinks... 

Whatever your heart desires, they've got it. From iced coffee, juice and sodas. For those of you who don't like soda, they also have several carbonated and flavored drinks which I appreciated. 

I'll probably be back again as I played a bit in the casino. 

I'll bring my appetite."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Been a long time loyal customer of Boyd Gaming and have enjoyed many amazing trips to Vegas based on my play.

Boyd is a pretty generous group.

I've stayed in their older and newer properties and have never had any issues.

From exclusive pentouse suites to standard deluxe rooms, all are comfy and clean.

Most of their properties are smaller than other hotels and casinos on the strip but it works to their benefit.

Patrons that I've spoken to love the ease of getting in and out of their resorts and I totally agree!

From Downtown to the Strip, I've been able to pick and choose when I want to visit and where I want to stay.

Sometimes I enjoy staying at the Main Street or California.  Suites are clean and comfortable. 

Their food offereing are reasonably priced and amazingly delicious!

Sometimes I enjoy staying further away from the strip. The Suncoast has enormous suites with beautiful views of the neighboing area and golf course. 

If I want to be literally a hop and a skip from the strip, The Gold Coast is ideal.  You can take an Uber or Lyft or even a Boyd Shuttle to be in all the action.

If you don't like the strip and want to be in Boulder Highway, Eastside Cannery and Sam's Town are decent properties as well.  Boutique style but only 15-20 minutes away from the strip.

The ease of using their reservations system is simple.  Whether calling in to speak with a representative or using the online platform, free rooms are only minutes away from booking.

Thanks Boyd for taking care of me over the years. Win, lose or draw. You've been good to me. 

Be back soon!"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"I can't say enough about this place.  Having stayed on many of the high end hotels on the strip over the past few years, I've come to enjoy staying away from the hustle and bustle.  This place is perfect for a romantic getaway - not for a bachelor party. 

Check in was simple and no lines to speak of.

The newly updated suites, especially the Tuscan Suite, boasts 1800 square feet of space - perfect for relaxation and entertaining guests.  There are 4 Flat Screen TVs and comfortably sofas and a long wet bar. If you're intending to get work done during a business trip, there's also a CEO Style desk, perfectly located next to the bar... 

The huge King Suite has accent lighting and crown molding on the ceilings. The bed is very comfortable and has an awesome view of the Strip both daytime and nighttime. 

The bathroom is very swanky. The deep soaking tub with jets helps put you into relaxation mode.  With the view of the picturesque gold course... you feel like a winner even without stepping foot into the casino.  The shower can fit 10 people easy.  It too has an eagles eye view of the strip, which very unique.  The automatic windows open and close with a push of a button... 

The entire suite has floor to ceiling windows, which left all the natural light in.  All the decor in the room is simple yet elegant.  The art in the guest restroom is just as nice as the art in the Master Bathroom.  

I came here to relax and impress my wife... let's just say she's hard to impress... but with this most recent stay, I think it's safe to say, she wouldn't mind coming back with me and not having to stay at the Cosmo, Palazzo or Wynn.  

Thank you Suncoast Hotel and Casino! Can't wait to come back and feel spoiled..."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Visited here the past weekend and was excited to see what all the hype was about with Park MGM Las Vegas.  Been here a few times in between the transition phases from Monte Carlo to what it is now.

It is a beautiful property, which would be considered boutique.  Comparable to the SLS on the North End of the Strip.  What's great is you don't have to walk far from your room to your car or the strip.  

Parking is currently $15 per night but depending on your MLife Status, it could be free. Mine was. Cause I ball like Lonzo. 

The color combos and decor are welcoming and relaxing.

The Pools are perfect for everyone.  I like that it didn't have the EBC Vibe or too many toddler splashing around.  

The rooms are comfortable and each room has a view of the strip, whether front or back.

The technology in the room is adequate as the TV swivels to the lounge couch and chair or bed.  The AC works and is quiet.  Depending on what type of room you decide to book, you'll have more than enough room for your things.  I really like the height of the bed, it was lower than usual and was very comfortable.  My room had a view overlooking the pool and the strip (city-center).  I was pleased with my accommodations.

The casino, though small has enough machines and tables.  I noticed there's still lots of room down the hallways to add more machines, which I'm sure they will do.

The Starbucks, which is right off the lobby is a great addition but does get busy. 

If you're not in a hurry, try Primerose. 

I can see the potential of this property and must give kudos to the MGM Team in re-creating this hotel as well as the area.  They were smart in having it all connected.  Most patrons won't want to leave and if they do, they'll end up in an MGM Property to eat, stay or play. 

Can't wait to get back."
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Always a good time and has been for several decades.

I've been coming here as a child and as an adult and have always enjoyed the glitz and glamor of the World Famous Las Vegas Strip.  It's definitely the place to see and be seen. It has evolved many times from being the adult Disneyland to being more family oriented to back to being the adult Disneyland. 

The waves change every ten years and so does the profitability of the strip.

When the economy is running on all cylinders there are high occupancy levels and gaming revenues. When the economy is slow you'll find less people and more homeless people on the walkways and streets.

With the closing of several iconic hotels to make way for openings of newer and more lavish mega resorts I've come to enjoy the transitions.  Being able to pinpoint where establishments used to be and what they are now makes me feel old and nostalgic.

The Las Vegas Strip has always been the iconic place to visit when you turn 21,22,102! 

So much to see and so much to do in so little time.  

From binge drinking, boxing, buffets, concerts, fine dining, gambling shopping, to sight seeing, UFC - whatever you want to do, you can and at any time of the day or night. You can do it by foot, car, monorail or simply by sitting in your room.

Something about Las Vegas and the strip still entices me to come back and always yearning for more. I've vowed to stay in every hotel on the strip as well as downtown before I kick the bucket. I've amassed many room keys and do not disturb signs as well as a few matches. Consider it hoarding... But I want to be able to tell my grandkids that I've been here and there and this is my proof of the good times I've had in Vegas.

Whether your rich or broke attractive or ugly- it doesn't matter in Vegas. When you're here you own the world even if it's only for a weekend.

Do yourself a favor and visit more frequently! 

See you around. Cheers!"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Decided to have dinner here at Mesa as the Bacchanal Buffet was madness and my wife and I couldn't have been happier.

This place does get busy and it's about noisy as it's a few steps away from the casino and always full sports book.

Reservations are recommended but walk ins are welcome. 

There's a decent sized bar available for patrons who wait to be seated.  The restaurant is very colorful and appealing to the eyes. 

The tables are a good size and offer all sorts of arrangements suitable for small or large groups.

My wife and I were seated closer to the bar and had a great view of the sports book. Which is what I needed as I had a heavy bet on the Steelers against the Colts.... let's just say that I really enjoyed my meal as the Steelers won lol.

The food we ordered were delicious and very flavorful. Portions were small as expected on the strip with prices that most people would consider are a bit overpriced but since I had won, didn't bother me.

I was starving and pretty much devoured the jalapeño bread but also decided on a few appetizers.

We had the crab cake and shrimp tamale to start coupled with a beer and wine. All choices were absolutely worth it. 

Within minutes my wife's veal chop and my turkey dinner came out. 

Both were perfectly cooked and seasoned. My plate was colorful and tasted as good as it looked. My wife's meal was delicious as well. It was plated perfectly that I had to take a pictures and of course have a taste.  The sides on my plate were so good that I'm literally salivating again just thinking about it. The kale as well as the yam were surprisingly good. I'm not usually a fan of both but I've changed my view now. 

Our server was very attentive and always checking in on us. Our drinks were topped off and plates and table were cleared quickly.

Considering our bill was north of $200 I'd say it was worth it. You can probably find comparable meals off strip for half but to say that I've finally tried this place after all of these years is priceless. 

Cheers Bobby Flay and crew! 

My wife was satisfied which means I was too!

See you again when I'm back in Sin City! 

Cheers!"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Giada at the Cromwell is worth the visit. Whether you're paying $1 an ounce for veal or $15 a cocktail you'll be happy. 

I highly suggest securing a reservation on your own or with a casino host and ask for a premium table- you will be blown away by the view. 

From the moment you make your way up the escalator and greeted by a host with a short skirt you feel this is not your ordinary Las Vegas Restaurant. 

There's a photo booth set up but now currently usable but you can still take pics with your own camera. 

The entrance is welcoming as you see the Sous chefs preparing food and next to it the huge bar and lounge area. The dining area itself has a great layout with great samples of art. The decor is simple yet very elegant. With views of Flamingo Avenue and Las Vegas Blvd. 

There are booths in the Al Fresco section and small tables in the other section. 

Keep in mind if you want a premium seat you must order at least $100 per person in food and beverage which is easily met with the Taster Menu. You'll get a dessert cart where you can have everything that your sweet tooth desires. Also, you'll get a special personally signed photo menu from Giada. 

If you're looking for huge portions this isn't the place for you but if you're looking for savory flavor, Giada's favorites will definitely surprise you. The salads and appetizers packed so much taste...

The entrees were again scrumptious! 

I want to add that Valentino and his crew were very excellent in terms of providing service. Our drinks were topped off and were asked if we needed anything else about every 10-15 minutes. Plates were cleared etc... 

I'm not sure why this place has a few two star reviews... Maybe my wife and I were lucky, we were impressed not disappointed. We will be back again when in Vegas. 

If you haven't had visited Giada - trust me, you must give this place a try. 

I no longer believe the saying of ""never trust a skinny chef!"" 

Giada, if you read this review...

Thank you Giada for putting a great restaurant on the strip. My wife was happy, therefore I was too. 
Wish we came in a week ago to be able to meet you. Your restaurant, like you is beautiful! Thanks"
Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"So made it to the Grand Opening of the Lucky Dragon Hotel and Casino.

Let me start off by saying it's nice to see a new building in the North End of the Strip as it adds a little bit more action to what used to be a slow end of modern day Vegas. 

There's more tourists making their way to this end and I'm glad to finally see it coming around from the most recent recession.

Now back to Lucky Dragon Hotel and Casino...

It's situated between the two main attractions - SLS (formerly the iconic Sahara) and the Stratosphere... both in sure are thankful for their new neighbor. 

The taco truck and the gift shop on the sale corner are glad this place opened as well.

During their Grand Opening, they were giving away $8-$888 in freeplay to new card member sign ups as well as $18 to be used at any of their restaurants which was well worth the 15-30 minute wait in my opinion. 

My friends joined me and were all glad that I invited them to come check out this new mini resort.

The place is a bit to reach which is why I have a 4-star instead of 5 but aside from that it's a beautiful property. 

You can walk from either the SLS or Stratosphere to avoid the jammed garage or valet.  Once you enter the casino you can't help but notice beautiful color combo of red and gold. The marble and wood floors were a nice touch as well. 

The players club had only three members working which added to the line for new player sign ups but they did work efficiently and were very friendly.

The casino floor has a circled layout which is encircled with primarily Baccarat Tables and a few blackjack tables. I'd say there are at least 500 Asian Themed slot machines as well. 

What I was surprised to see was a Bitcoin Machine.

There's a good sized bar in the center of all the action and directly above it is a gold dragon. 

Being this was a Grand Opening I can see why there were tons of people.

There were Miss Universe Models trotting around as well as entertainers singing live which kept the patrons entertained if they understood... 

I'll be back again but probably when the hype dies down. 

The majority of the visitors were Chinese and I'm sure that's because the hotel offers direct flights to and from China to their resort. 

As I left the resort, I did notice a few limos from other properties pulling in, so it looks like there's new competition for semi and mega whales. 

Thanks Lucky Dragon Hotel and Casino for your generosity. 

See you soon!

Ryxj0u0AW3mRsRypdYli2A,"Not sure what is going on with this hotel...  Been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience until now.  I can't give the resort a 1 star as I know where they've been long term and hope they turn things around soon.  

I Booked a Two Bedroom Panoramic Suite and was expecting nothing but the best as I have been accustomed to for more than a decade!

The check in process was a pain.  Checked in to the front desk only to be told that my room wasn't ready and to expect a call near 3pm.  This was 1:30pm.  Came back after 3pm as I didn't get a text or call as promised. Waited another 30 minutes as the front desk associate was trying to find out why my room wasn't ready. Eventually by 4pm I was given my room keys and was able to get access to my suite.

Apparently, they had to switch floors to accommodate my room type, which was specific upon booking the reservation. 

The suite has double doors, which would have been great if one didn't need to be adjusted as it was very hard to open and close.  Maybe replace the hinge before other guests check in. 

The room was spacious and clean, so I'll give the cleaning crew a nod for a great job... 

What's worse, is at 7:30pm, I received the phone call from the front desk notifying me that my room was now available to check-in! This was the call that I was suppose to receive at 3pm! Obviously something is wrong with their computer system or front desk staff...  Very frustrating and upsetting. 

The Wifi didn't work in the rooms and the TVs, though huge kept dropping signal.  

Also, the light in one of the bathrooms didn't work.  I requested to have it replaced the first night but even upon check out, it hadn't been fixed.

The $40 per day resort fee, includes Wifi and access to the POOL that was not open- should not be charged to guests. Since parking is also charged.  Parking is reasonable but check your room bill upon checking out!  They applied a valet fee for two nights, which I didn't use once!  I parked in the garage the entire visit. To make things worse, they were also trying to charge me for jerky from the mini bar, which we didn't even touch...  Amazing.  

One thing that really irritated me was at 10am, the cleaning crew was already banging on the doors saying we had to be out! Check out time is 11:00am.  I've never had this happen to me, ever out of all my visits to Vegas.  Whether it was at the Wynn, Palazzo or even Caesars. 

Seeing that there have been recent reviews from other guests that haven't been very positive, I'm sad to say it's hard to stay away from a place where I've had so many great moments with friends and family.  I may not return to the Mandalay Bay, Delano or any other MGM Property.

With so many other options on the Strip, you'll probably want to consider looking else where."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"First time I have been to Humble Pie and was glad to see that they opened one near my home on Happy Valley.  I added this place on Yelp and not even 12 hours later there was already 2 bad reviews for the service here.  I am sure they are still working out the kinks since our service was just okay as well but nothing to get ""panties in a twist about"".  We had a big table and sat outside with the nice heaters, the atmosphere was nice and new inside.  We ordered a side of french fries, fried green beans, and caprese for appetizers.  All of these were just great since the beans and fries came with mayonnaise based sauces that were awesome.  The caprese was different with cherry tomatoes (not my fav), liquified mozzarella, pesto, bread, and oil & vinegar.....although different I thought it was still very good but my wife did not care for it.  We both ordered pizzas, I had the SOP (sausage, caramelized onion, & peppers) and this was a great pizza with lots of great flavor.  The pizza is thin but the end crust is pretty thick and very good.  We will definitely go back and I am sure Humble Pie will work out the kinks on service but we were glad the service was decent for us."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"Came back here for the first time since they first opened and I did not review it the first time because it was a 2-3 star experience and I wanted to give it another try.  I can certainly understand why Jennifer and Jojo wrote a bad review for this place because the 67ave & Bell location gives this place very large shoes to fill.  The first time I came here the sushi was small and the taste was not memorable but when we came back yesterday the sushi was as good as the Bell road location.  We ordered some of our favorites like the ""climax"", ""school bus"", ""spicy tuna lover"" and one other I cant remember right now but it was good too.  I really like their specialty rolls here and on Tuesday's they have ""by one get one half off"".  We stuffed ourselves and had a few drinks.  They have some beer selections but they only have 2 alcohols (vodka & crown royal) so don't come here for the drinking, that is what Squid Ink is for.  The service was OK, and the atmosphere is very casual.  The whole room is about 30 by 30 in size with about 12-15 tables inside.  Nothing fancy but the sushi is worth coming here, I'm not a fan of Squid Ink unless I'm going over for drinks at a happy hour."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"I'm giving this place 5 stars because the concept is awesome.  I have only been here twice but I am certain I will go back.  It is a huge place with a bar (2 I think), arcade, upscale bowling alley, laser tag, and I am sure i am missing stuff because I have not even walked the entire place.  It is nice, new, and upscale for a casual place for families.  It is really loud which is good if you already have kids since you don't want yours standing out.  There are huge TV screens all over and one that must be over 100"", the drinks are decent and the prices are typical (don't come here if you are cheap).  The service is pretty good, never had a problem and the food was okay but all I have eaten was steak sliders (which barely had sliced beef on it) and chicken fingers (cant really screw that up).  I do want to go back and eat here again since I really didn't go hungry so to be fair I wont deduct for the food.  I really appreciate places like this for families to go.  So once again it gets 5 stars just for existing and if you demand perfect service or complain about every little thing,  I really don't want you to be in the same building as me anyway...you are probably annoying."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"If you are Facebook friends with me you know that I love going to Suns games, I live for them.  It is a great way to have fun if you can get great seats, it feels like you are in the game since the court is not to big like in football or baseball.  I love row 9 or lower in the lower level sections (as long as it is not on the ends of the basket).  Toyota club is a little pricey for decent food that is included along with free bud, bud light, red and white wine, and sodas also included.  Toyota club is the first regular 6 rows in the 6 sections (101-103 & 113-115).  The black seats are sick! since they are on the floor and include an awesome buffet with access to where the Suns players enter and exit.  Also highly recommend going to a game when you are using crutches, I went to customer service and they will wheel chair you to your seat and actually go through the same tunnels under the arena that the players use (It was fricken awesome since we standing next to Shaq that game!).  Good lower level tickets start at about $80 and go up to about $200 and if you want the black seats you better take out a mortgage if you don't go to an off-game during the week and find the tickets on Craiglist...."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"Nancy Kelly has been doing massage out of this medical plaza location for many years now.  I go to her because of her knowledge and experience she has with massage.  She is always taking classes and events with experts in her field to improve her knowledge in massage therapy.  I have never met anyone like her before and I have friends that also use her and she has done some crazy stuff with her sessions that have improved eye sight!  Yes, my friend no longer wears contacts because he suffers from an issue with his neck that she can massage and he can see!  My personal experience with her has helped me with not feeling that I need a massage a day after I get one.  She figured out that the muscles in my jaw were causing strain to my traps and neck, after she used the pressure point therapy to release the muscles in my mouth my neck felt better for longer periods of time.  I can't say enough about Nancy, she has a great location in central Phoenix in a quiet office that she shares with 1 other therapist.  I highly recommend her to anyone that never feels that there massage session makes them feel good for longer than a day (which is what my problem was).  Also don't forget to ask her about curing my friends vision!"
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"I was let down to find out there was no yard inside the Yard House at Westgate but it was still a good time.  I came here last night with my family for my Wife & son's birthday.  We started off with a California roll & artichoke for appetizers.  We weren't too impressed with either but ate most of it, the roll was a gigantic piece of sushi packed with rice (should have taken a picture) so it was not the kind of roll you pick up with chop sticks.  The artichoke didn't seemed cooked all the way but most of it was pretty good.  Then I ordered the chicken enchilada stack and it was pretty good and I had a cup of the white chicken tortilla soup and that was the best I have ever had.  We also ordered the shrimp Caesar salad and a shrimp enchilada stack and everyone seemed to enjoyed it.   The atmosphere is great here with 2 beautiful patio areas and the bar inside has what looks like is about 100 draft beer selections, several flat screen TVs throughout.  The booths and table are very comfortable and the whole place has a nice dark warm feeling, great date place for dinner then grab a movie or show nearby.  We went out of our way to eat here for a reason, it is consistently great food, great service, & great atmosphere."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"I have passed this location many times growing up in this city and never thought anything of the place behind Circle K, put once again I can thank Yelp for inspiration after reading a few reviews.  I love that these guys are open at 10 am since that is lunch time for me because I start my morning at 5am.  The salsa was fantastic (always a good sign) and the bean dip was alright but not my favorite.  I love that they have a huge menu of $6 lunch specials.  My waitress told me that the number 7 (2 chicken enchiladas) was the most popular.  I had it with the sour cream and it was absolutely delicious.  The beans and rice were great also, I seen the Wednesday and Thursday specials that everyone was talking about and will have to check those out sometime soon.  The service was good for me but I was the first one there at 10am, I read a few of the negative reviews mentioning that but I enjoyed the experience.  I also thought the atmosphere was really clean and nice, actually was kind of surprised since reviews I read mentioned otherwise.  I don't know what people expect but I was overly impressed with the whole experience.  There was even a flat screen TV and the posters on the wall weren't to much.  I will be back soon."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"Do I really have to say why this is the best place every to buy stuff?  If you don't have a membership to this place its your problem.  Its not like there is a short of customers willing to go to this location and shop....it might be one of the most busy in the state.  It isn't just for large quantity stuff, although everything here you buy is in large quantity.  I hear complaints sometimes that couples with no kids don't need a bag of toilet paper that will last them a year....but I would argue that that same HUGE bag cost the same as a quarter of that same product anywhere else.  Also they have furniture, seasonal stuff like outdoor grills, clothing, tools, electronics, appliances, office supplies, sometimes wall decor/pictures, and almost everything else you can imagine.  The very best part is that they will return ANYTHING! (except a few electronics items) and you don't have to have the receipt since they have everything on file (it helps to know about when you bought it or keep the box or code for them to scan if no receipt is near).  I do mean anything since I returned a broken umbrella that I paid $700 bucks for that blew over in the wind 6 months after I bought it.  I don't abuse this option but when it matters I do."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"This is the best place to go to have your Sig Sauer worked on!  I called all over town for prices on a SRT (short reset trigger) for my P229 and these guys have the parts in stock and even installed a new E2 grips for more comfortable grip.  They also had my barrel and barrel feed ramp polished and they came out beautiful!!!  I am so pumped that I found these guys since I also lost one bolt to my P238 grip and NO ONE on the city has it in stock.  I tried purchasing the bolt online and they were going to charge $10 shipping but these guys had it in stock.  I also called Sig directly to get prices on all this stuff but their prices are way higher and with the shipping it seemed cheaper to sell my gun and buy one with everything I wanted done already.  Anyway these guys sell tons of guns (mostly Sig handguns) and several rifles.  Alan was very nice and super helpful and was able to finish my gun in a week!!!  This place is in a business complex and his front door faces W. Elna Rae Street so I recommend parking right in front.  Kind of small inside, only about 3 or 4 separate rooms with stuff but it was PACKED with guns and supplies.  I did ask if they had any Glock parts in stock but he didn't so I will stick with Glockmeister for that stuff, lol."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"Saw too many great reviews for this place to pass it up.....although I drove by it because it is hard to notice right behind the Taco Bell, so for a second I did pass it up.  It is a tiny little itty bitty restaurant with about 8 or so tables inside.  Service wasn't the best either but that is what is expected at a place like this.  Thank god for the Yelp app because I took one look at the menu and I got dizzy with trying to figure out what I wanted.  I went with Arlin B's recommendation on the sampler tamales and even got a beef turnover.  I was the first one in the place and it only took about an hour to get out of there because they were still setting up (like I said dont go for the service) but the tamales were awesome!  The masa was very moist which is huge and they had plenty of stuffing in each.  The Ecuadorian tamale was different but still very good, the green was the best with large green chilies inside, and the red was fantastic as well.  I did not care of the turn over and the salsa was spicy but to much of a tomato taste to it.  Maybe that is authentic Ecuadorian and if that is the case those folks have terrible taste.  The overall experience was worth it and I would go again....probably take out.  Bring your patience..... or a book."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"My son's request for his birthday was ""Old McDonald's""  so since my wife refuses I sucked it up and came here Saturday.  I am not a fan of McDonald's or a fan of what it represents, I have respect for Ray Krock but that is about it and I am not sure he would be proud of what he serves today either.  I hope the franchisee doesn't hate me for this review but since McDonald's targets kids with its toys (I know I used to love to go to this place too as a kid) then it gives me no choice but to speak the truth because I am a loyal Yelper that has kids.  My children of course ordered chicken nugget happy meals so they can get the stupid toy.  I made them get the apples and apple juice.  I had not been here in so many years that I noticed an Angus burger that was now on the menu and looked good in the picture.  Of course it was dry and bland, the fries here are always good but I have since learned that they are not exactly 100% potato so there you go.  I pretty much felt like crap when I left but I wanted to not keep my kids always wondering about this place with the desire to go inside.  Next time if he makes the request I will buy a slice of pizza from Barro's across the way and just eat that while my kids eat here.  Sorry McD's your food doesn't do it for me."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"So I am on this calorie counting diet that works everytime for me.  Problem is not many places have the calories on the menu.  Well my cousin told me that Black Angus did, so here I am writing a review.  I cant even tell you the last time I have been to a Black Angus but it was a pretty good experience.  The calories for each entree was only on the lunch menu but that worked for me at the time.  I know that restaurants that have more than 20 locations have to start following his new guideline and I cant wait because I people need to be able to at least make better choices when they want to.  Enough preaching.....The atmosphere was nice, very clean (this is awesome for the metro area), the decor was comforting and most seats felt private with high seats, the service was great, and the food....well, i didn't order a ribeye like I would have at a high end steak house so just move on to the next review.  I had the teriyaki chicken breast (think it was 280 calories) with wild rice (350 calories but I only ate half), and the steak soup (120 calories believe it or not).  I figure I had a good size lunch for about 700 calories including drink.  Not bad at all and the whole meal was pretty good.  Cost me almost $20 with tip but its not like I went to McDonald's for lunch, right?"
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"Came here last night with the wife for a date night, I bought a groupon like a few others on here.  I quickly realized that this used to be the old Tomaso's which is still on Camelback.  The atmosphere is a little dated, I remember it being the same when it was Tomaso's about 10-15 years ago.  I called for reservations a few hours earlier and was able to get a 6:15 reservation.  Place was still calm then but by the time we left it was pretty packed (Friday night).  Service was good, they were helpful with picking out the entrees and we started with the caprese brochette combo salad and that was just phenomenal.  I love a good caprese to start, I ordered a combination plate of stuffed veal and gnocchi in a butter sauce.  Both were very rich and very good, veal was a little tough but very flavorful.  A few drinks and goofy pictures taken with the decor we got out of there for about $160 bucks but since I had the groupon it only cost me about $100 (I still tipped about $30).  I read a few reviews before ordering and couldn't help but notice the douche-bags that thought this place was overpriced.  Did you guys think you were going to Fazoli's?  WTF?  When your review is a few lines long only complaining about the price, you look more foolish than the restaurant.....just saying."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"Yes.....my name is Eli
Yes.....I finally took my wife on a date to Eli's

The atmosphere is a nice bar/restaurant with plenty of big screens, college football was playing everywhere and I actually finally saw a Sun Devils game for the first time....ha ha.   The service was OK, I like when I ask a server what she likes or what is popular but she gave me the same boring cliche that everything was good and nothing was ordered more than anything else (yeah right).  Anyway, my wife and I ordered the the artichoke dip which was so good we licked the bowl.  This thing tasted so good and creamy, it had to be homemade!  I also got a half order of the many sliders they have to choose from (prime rib for me) and they were great dipped in the au-jus.  I ordered the ribs with a ranch salad and the wife ordered the fish & chips (which were rated number one....by whom I have no idea)  They were both great, my ribs fell off the bone and the BBQ was great and my ranch salad was so taste (I love homemade ranch!) that I licked that plate also.  My wife thought the fish was good but I cant say that she would rave number one but I am not sure anyone else has one that is better.  

I also found out that the owners last name are Elias and they went with Eli's so dont go inside asking for Eli....it will get you no where!"
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"I want to start off by saying that I was very impressed by the service and professionalism of this location and really felt they were professional.  However, after taking my car here for an oriole change they made a list of recommendations for my car including a leaking water pump which made me extra nervous since I was about to take a trip to Telluride Colorado this weekend.  I did not have time to leave it with them to make this repair so I was going to just take my wife's car on the trip, however I did have time the next morning to drop the car off at my mechanic for an hour to have him confirm all the recommendations.  My mechanic was not able to find a leak anywhere near the water pump or hear any malfunctioning noises of any sort. The other recommendations for hoses also seemed unnecessary. I understand that many mechanics like to be extra cautious and better safe than sorry however, either the water pump was leaking or it's not.  What bothered me is it gave me anxiety about my trip and I find myself feeling that I can't trust this place any longer.  I'm writing this review mostly so I can have a record of the date that my ""leaking water pump"" started and to see how long my car will last with this bad water pump. I will gladly revise this review if my water pump goes out or begins to leak badly in the next few months."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"Unfortunately I am able to review this brand new emergency room hospital that is an extension of the Arrowhead Hospital on Lake Pleasant and north of Happy Valley.  I was playing soccer at ASC Friday night and landed on the keepers foot when I went for the ball, I somehow fractured my right tibia (upper leg near knee).  At the time it did not seem like I broke anything but the pain wasn't friendly so I thought I would stop by and meet those folks, ha ha.  Anyway the place was empty at 9pm on a Friday night and they came out with a wheel chair so I didn't have to walk.  They asked about 3-5 minutes of questions and got me right in.  They did vitals and I spoke with a nurse, assistant, and ER doctor in about 15 minutes.  A few minutes later they had me in Xray and another 20 the doc gave me the news.  Everyone was nice and depending on the insurance carrier is how much you pay.  I had to pony up $150 for Blue Cross but I am sure the damage is much worse than that.  Before I left they shot me up with Demerol, gave me a script for percocet, and sent me away with a disc of my Xray's....so I don't have to keep paying for those.   Whole experience lasted about and hour and a half I think...was drugged up so well I am really not sure I should even be reviewing this place.  Anyway, I am very glad to have an ER near my home in the NW valley."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"They pulled a bait and switch on me where they advertised a car but all of a sudden when I got there it's nowhere to be found so they can try to screw me on another car.  I think everytime a dealership does this, we should all call them out.  I also do not think rewarding the dealership with your business after they just mislead you into their establishment.  I called and spoke to one salesman who assured me the car was onsite after I gave him the stock number.  I asked him to physically look at the car to make sure it was there....except when I got there he started to say ""it was just parked right here"".  Of course after he tried to sell me something else I quickly told him that I was not interested in buying anything else from them.  He grabbed his manager and of course he asks ""what exactly are you looking for sir""  which means ""what else can we sell you now that we lied to you in order to get your business""  I tell him that I am looking for this particular car and he assures me they have it and start to tell me that they cant find it.  I think that it is a big joke and they new I was upset.  I only gave them 2 stars since I don't hate these people personally and I am sure that this is what they are supposed to do which means the dealership is who is responsible and that this will continue to happen until people start calling this crap out."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"Very impressed with the upscale dining experience over at Litchfield's in the SW Valley.  Thanks to Yelp for saving us from driving to Scottsdale for a birthday dinner for my daughter who has moved to Avondale.  The service and atmosphere of the entire resort is top of the line and just beautiful.  You have to walk though the bar to access the entrance.  The kitchen is awesome because you can see everything getting cooked right in front of you with no walls and it was the cleanest restaurant kitchen I have ever seen in my life.  The food was pretty darn good also.  I ordered the prime rib-eye steak special with crab meat covering it (see pic), my daughter got the spare rib special, and my wife got the salmon.   My steak was just ridiculous and pretty sure I could have used a butter knife to cut it.  The flavor was just spectacular with a marbling taste, also had a burgundy sauce (garlic/buttery flavored) that was just perfect with the steak and pretty large portion.  I did not care for crab meat on top of the steak but the mashed potatoes were good as well.  My daughter loved her spare rib which was small but we used a fork to cut it and she had some avocado that was slightly fried with batter which was very good and different.  My wife thought the salmon was very good but the sides did not compliment is very well.  Overall the food and experience was just perfect for our occation."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"First time I had pizza here for some reason....and cant they make something that is gross!  I have eaten here tons of times and every experience with the food and service is the best ever.  I have had the Alfredo the Dark (fettuccine alfredo), the big beef sandwich, the big tuna sandwich, and now chicken wings and pizza.  The alfredo is so creamy and flavorful with a bit of spicy to it.  I remember not being able to finish the gigantic plate of noodles.  The beef sandwich makes my mouth water just thinking about it but my table was craving to share pizza and wings today so we ordered the pepperoni pizza thin crust and it was truly amazing.  The garlic was perfect the crust was and cheese were a great consolidation of flavor.  The chicken wings were great also, the sauce was a little thick and had a garlic hint to it as well.  Of coarse what would a visit to Oregano's without ordering a macadamia nut pazookie!  Man, this place is the best place for the cookie desert with ice cream, the half cooked cookie inside a good 10"" pan and about 1/2"" thick is so flavorful and good.  I almost got sick from eating to much.  Also if you have never been to an Oregano's be prepared to wait since they are always busy, the atmosphere is way casual and the decor is so very cool and trendy.  I cant think of a better consistent trendy place for great food and great service.  It's most definitely as good as it gets!"
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,I was hoping to build a relationship with a transmission shop since I have 6 company trucks that are always pulling trailers.  I found these guys online but wish I had yelped them first.  I sent my crew foreman in and had him request the heavy duty tranny so we would not have to go back.  They call and you go over their recommendations over the phone after they take everything apart and I agreed to the heavy duty rebuild.   After about 6 months the transmission went bad and it started to slip.  We went in but they said they found nothing wrong...so of course we drove it for another week before it completely blew after which case they said they saw the most damage they have ever seen and cant warranty unless I make other improvements onto my truck (lets not forget that a week early they said nothing was wrong).  So I agree to the additional repairs (both receipts are pictured on Yelp).  The repairs included replacing the cluster that tells you what gear you are in.  They said the cluster was not clear which gear you are in and that is why my transmission went out....they seem to think we drove everywhere in first or second gear and never noticed.   After the repair now we cant get the transmission into overdrive.  Needless to say I wont bother going back.  The customer service is poor and they are very pushy and bossy when dealing with issues.  I don't mind paying for repairs but if we want a real warranty I would go elsewhere.
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"AG is the best place for a steak in the NW Valley, I have been here many times to enjoy the rib-eye and my wife usually gets the NY steak.  I love the seasoning choices and the sides are great as well, love the cream corn and cream spinach and my wife loves the asparagus.  I ordered fish once and didn't care for it much but the overall experience here is fantastic.  It is a great date night place and you can still go casual because in the NW valley we are not Scottsdale!  In the winter time they are open for lunch and the lunch items are great as well, not a cheap place for food but there is a reason for that.....this food is fanf*ckingtastic!  The atmosphere is upscale but not too fancy, its still in a strip mall area but we love this place and appreciate the good food and people.  They have a nice entrance, fire place inside and outside the bar area.  The bar is great which is where I was last night watching Monday night football with friends.  They have specials sometimes when you are on the email list and I ordered the AG burger which has prime rib slices on the burger with swiss cheese and comes with horseradish sauce (man was is awesome!).  The service is great and the deserts are awesome, I brought my kids here once and we ordered the smores and they brought out this chocolate bowl with a candle underneath to keep in warm and 4"" thick brownie size marshmallows to wrap gram crackers around, it was messy but my kids loved it!"
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"Wow, thanks to Yelp I would have never stopped into this place.  I never find myself in this area much and would not have gone out of my way unless I read some great reviews on Yelp first.  So I bookmarked it Tuesday and 2 days later here I am.  Man the food was great, I had the number 100 which was recommended by the nice waitress.  It was a red beef tamale, beef taco, cheese enchilada, beans & rice.  My 3 year old son was with me so I got him a chicken taco with rice.  I have to say that the taco was the best i have ever had for authentic Mexican.  It was a homemade taco shell (which is really key) and full of meat, cheese, & lettuce.  Not to mention the hot sauce/salsa was spicy and very flavorful and went perfect on this taco.  I loved the tamale too, it wasn't dry and was packed full of meat, the cheese enchilada had a great red sauce and the cheese over everything was not overwhelming.  The beans were great as well which is an important test if you want to know how good a Mexican food place is...well that and the chips and salsa which were addictive too.  The atmosphere is casual with lots of decorations and pictures, you can tell it has been here a long time but it does not look old and run down.  The service was just awesome which is rare for an authentic Mexican joint, and the owner or manager came over and made my son a dog out of a balloon for him and it kept him busy the whole meal.  Thank you ""Mi Patio"" and thank you ""Yelpers"" as well."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"I agree with Rachel C. & Luciana L. on the parking situation and the logistics of the whole place.  Although I will probably go again because my kids do enjoy it and I was able to get the last paid parking spot (at 11am).  I have been to this event and others in downtown Glendale and they can't handle the volume of people that go to these things.  Downtown Glendale is similar to downtown Scottsdale but 1/10th the size and capacity.  There are tons of little shops in a historic district with ONE parking garage and whats worse is you will pass many empty lots that they pay cops to stand around just to make sure you dont park there.  I finally ask a police officer where CAN we actually park.  Anyway, the event was cool with lots for the kids, it is a farmers market that sells food you would find at the fair thrown in with some chocolate vendors, jumpers and carnival type rides for the kids in separate areas that require separate tickets for each area (this was way annoying too).  Glendale could do better by putting up directories everywhere for people to know where they are, where bathrooms are, and they could spread things out and offer more space per human being (I am sure this place is stupid in the evening).  Plus they need to do something about parking, even if they build a HUGE garage and charge $20 a car at least there would be options for people who dont want to walk a mile before they walk around for miles....

All that said, we will probably go next year because we still do not know the definition of insanity."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"We all know that the cost of healthcare has gone up after the start of Obamacare, but these guys figured out how to save small businesses money.  I have been using them for my small landscape business to be Obamacare compliant for me, my family, and my employees.  They have plans that start as low as $86/ month per employee that are compliant with the law!  I dont  know of a single insurance company that offers that.  There are higher levels for more coverage but to be able to start at such a low price so that you do not pay tax penalties is an awesome way to start.  Because we save the difference I was spending on my families health insurance ($700/ month for a bronze plan to only $260/month with Redirect), I can save $500 per month into an HSA savings account to pay for my medical expenses that way.  Of course we are relatively healthy and hardly ever go to the doctor so we have saved up quite a bit of money (I had an HSA for about 5 years now).   You can choose to purchase plans that cover major medical or get some stop loss plans like Aflac that pay for emergencies to divert risk that way instead of giving such a large amount of money to the insurance company.  I know that this review will not do this company justice since this industry is so complex and there are so many variables....but the way that rates are increasing annually for health insurance I am not sure that anyone will be able to afford it any longer.  I know families paying $1200/ month for health insurance (that is the cost of a small mortgage!!!)  If you own a business and are at least an LLC with a W2 payroll you owe it to yourself to at least check it out."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"So I fractured my tibia in mid-Jan and my orthopedic doctor had me tested for blood clots and what do you know.....I win that contest.  So I had to find a primary care physician nearby since I just moved to the far NW valley.  My wife told me about this place since it was across from my son's pediatrician which is right behind Best Buy at Lake Pleasant & Happy Valley in North Peoria.  The place is brand new and Doctor Charity Weldt is nice.  She was willing to work with me and the fact that I hate pharmaceutical companies.  She uses technology in her practice which is awesome since old crow doctors lose their minds after a while and you have to ""just trust"" their judgment (lame).  I had to take blood thinners till my blood clot goes away and she would pull her iPhone out to input my data in an app that tells her exactly the amount of cumidin I need to thin my blood (all this is probably foreign to you).  I also had her test my cholesterol because its been high in the past and she was the first doctor that did not just trust the readings that came back from the blood test.  Once again she imputed the data in an iPhone app and turns out because of my age, body fat and ect that my bad cholesterol was allowed to be as high as 160 instead of the 130 that the test recommended.  Most doctors would slip me a script for statin and send me on my way.  I am convinced that the drug companies need us on something at all times to please their shareholders instead of whats best for us.  Anyway she gave me alternatives to get mine closer to 160 since I was only at 172.  

Oh yeah I almost forgot the most important part, Dr. Weldt is pretty cute too."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"*****Review update***** 3/30/17
I have since had to replace my water pump on my 2012 Malibu. I feel bad that I was critical to these guys but it did take a few months to go bad. As promised I would update the review if I later found out that they were correct about my water pump being bad.  I owe them an apology and a five star review. 



I want to start off by saying that I was very impressed by the service and professionalism of this location and really felt they were professional.  However, after taking my car here for an oil change they made a list of recommendations for my car including a leaking water pump which made me extra nervous since I was about to take a trip to Telluride Colorado this weekend.

I will gladly revise this review if my water pump goes out or begins to leak badly in the next few months."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"I have to tell you that I was very skeptical that this place actually received 26 great reviews for being open only a few months (and not one single bad or even average review).   Since I work around the corner and this area of town is lacking in good food, I had to go there.  They even open at 10am which is great for me since I am at the office at 5:30am and that is my lunch time.  I get to strip mall next to the payday loan place and walk inside, I detected a small odor that reminded me of a Filbertos but it seemed to go away or maybe I just got used to it.  Anyway, I quickly notice the sodas along the wall and get excited of the fact that I actually get to finally taste a Dublin Dr Pepper!  Yep, this place has every old school authentic soda you cant find anywhere or aren't willing to pay for shipping to your home.  I went to the counter and was quickly helped by one of the owners who recommended the New Yorker....I thought to myself  ""I only get this sandwich at Miracle Mile""  but OK, I want the full experience and if that is the popular sandwich than that's what I want.  Can you say HOLY S#$T it was GREAT, so flavorful and fresh tasting.  I ordered it on a toasted sub and not only was it much easier to eat than the New Yorker at the Mile but it was actually more tasty.  This place has figured it out, and my whole meal was about $7 and that was only because my Dublin Dr Pepper was $1.89 since finding one is like finding a ""beheading in AZ"", I would expect to pay a little extra for that.  I will most definitely come back to try more of the menu and keep you posted.  As an added note the other owner came up to me and gave me a free canned Dr Pepper just so I could try it next to the Dublin, these are cool guys.  Thanks guys!"
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"Alright, finally got to see what the carpet looked like after the grand opening which was so packed we could not even see the floor.  Very nice place for a date night and a cool bar to watch the big game and even the patio looked sharp.  Very upscale is a little of what we need over here in the west side and I refuse to knock it for the crazy grand opening.  We left after 10 minutes and ran up to Arrowhead Grill for dinner that night, but you cant fault a place for being to popular.  They can't help that they are so good!  

Anyway, we double dated with friends in the area and we started with the shrimp appetizer on top of rice, I am not a big fan of shrimp but it was pretty good, we also all ordered 1 tortilla with butter (which had a sweet flavor to it so it made it special).  I ordered the green chili chicken enchiladas......can I say heavenly?  Hell yes I can, this stuff was great!  The perfect amount of cilantro, sour cream, a tiny bit of spice, and just a great dish.  It was in a 10"" low rim bowl with a side of white rice.  My wife and her girlfriend both ordered the 7 layer salad which I guess was good because they both cleaned their bowls as well.  My friend ordered the Argentinian steak....which I presume came from Argentina.  My buddy let me steal a bite and I will be coming back for that since it was darn good,  it had a fajita flavoring to it served with mashed potatoes.  The menu overall isn't to large....it had a few salads, sandwiches, appetizers, only a few entries like the steak and enchiladas and a couple of fish as well.  Then the bottom had a few options for their street tacos and then some desserts.  I am so pleased with this place and cant wait to return.  Once again a home run for Chef Charles!  Oh I forgot to mention our server was great, he had a sense of humor and did a great job and never left us dry."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"I just joined today and the biggest reason for the membership is the distance to my home (1 mile away).  The gym itself is beautiful inside and out and they are a little too cocky in my opinion.  They also said that their prices are non-negotiable which is nice as long as I don't find out someone is paying less than me which always happens.  I came from a 2 year membership at 24hr Fitness for $300 which is a smoking deal since it comes out to $12/month but closest gym is 43ave & Bell.  I agree with Bianca the shower curtains look like there is mold on them and my salesperson told me that their prices are higher because they are a high end gym which means that the water should be soften in my opinion.  I mean I have soft water at home and wouldn't call my home high end.  Anyway, I worked out here for the first time and all the equipment is 1st class nice new equipment, I thought it was odd that there was only ONE flat bench press which means I wont be doing that much.  Good thing there is lots of other nice equipment to work out with.  I love all the cardio machines and how everyone has its own TV.  The entire atmosphere is really, really nice.  There is a large movie screen room as you enter the bathrooms, there is several showers, and nice lockers with plenty of room to change.  There is carpet in the bathroom locker area which is OK as long as it is replaced every few years because that would be gross.  There is all kinds of other services and a great snack bar and the kids area seems cool with surveillance for anyone to see what is going on.  My biggest complaint about this place is that there is no jacuzzi, I love using them after a workout because it relaxes my muscles and is very therapeutic (only reason I took a star away).  Other than that I really enjoyed the work out and hope that this review stays at 4 stars....I mean I hope they get a jacuzzi so I can give them back a star."
9hMqNBBpTl3lBy6qCAyu-A,"I am highly annoyed with Sam's Club right now.  I have always been a fan of both Costco and Sam's, but more recently Sam's changed it's return policy on electronics.  Now from a business stand point I completely understand that you were sick of taking my big screen TV back every year or two to upgrade my set with such a liberal return policy.  This is not what upset me but rather that I tried to return a jumper box and a large floor lamp that  stopped working.  I don't ever keep my receipt because it is a membership club that files EVERYTHING I buy in their system.  The return policy is still rather liberal but if they cant find the item they make you feel like you are taking advantage of them.  You see the reason I buy almost everything at both Sam's and Costco is because they make these companies stand behind their products (crazy I know), why else would I pay for an annual membership.  Anyway, Sam's also says  that their system only keeps files now for 2 years.  I went over to Costco later that day and guess what...they have files that go back to 2001.  I know it seems crazy to return anything after that long but I am not one of  those tool-bags that returns everything and I spend quite a bit of money at each club since I go out of my way to purchase there.  The final straw was when my mom tried  to go back to have them fix a nail in a tire she bought from them just 1 month ago (keep in mind that discount will fix any tire for free no matter where you purchase it) and she also had her receipt but because I bought them for her for Christmas and she does not have a membership.  They would not help her without my Sam's club membership number....OK, well the number was worn out on my card and it took an additional 15 minutes with me arguing over the phone with these pricks that SHE HAS A FRICKEN RECEIPT!!!  I am strongly contemplating canceling my membership with these guys.  It probably wont matter since Walmart owns the world now but they cant stay on top forever if they keep changing their rules."

I usually only visit Cabela's a couple times a year during major sales when they have super good deals on this or that. I popped in today when I was in the neighborhood and walked around thinking I might buy some ammunition for a new rifle I bought somewhere else. The prices were not phenomenally horrible but also not all that great considering I had just bought some ammo at another store for about 30% less than what they were asking for the same thing here.

I think when you shop here it's kind of similar to bass pro shops, where you pay a little extra for the environment and also the massive selection at your fingertips. If you are here to buy a gun though be prepared to take a number and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait until they get around to you after everyone else asks two hours worth of questions as if they don't have any idea about what they're there to buy in the first place.

I was a bit flustered when I went to check out with nothing but a little camping stove bottle of fuel for my camping trip that I'm going on tomorrow. I had to stand in line for about 25 minutes with a whole bunch of people as the slowest checkout in the world transpired.

All in all this place has tons of potential but the store seems to be slow moving and even though not many customers are there it takes forever to get anything done if you need help from the staff. I would hate to see this place on the memorial day sale or something like that!"
3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"Decent food but high priced for what it is....

Well, we showed up at 4:15 for an early dinner and were told they don't open until 5pm. Yelp said open all day... So we waited after driving 49 minutes to eat here... We thought we would kill time on the phones using internet like normal.

This place has a rip off wifi policy of requiring you to pay $11.95 for a 4 hour pass while you spend your $50 per steak in the restaurant... There is almost no cell signal since this spot in in the basement so if you need the Internet this is not the place. 

The service once seated was alright... Nothing special... 

They do not have sweet tea, just the unsweetened stuff... That's always a disappointment....

Appetizer was corn chowder and it was actually a solid 4.5 out of 5 for a soup...

The flat bread with hummus was pretty good too, a 4 out of 5!

I had a Mojito with 10 Kane rum, it was decent, about 3.9 out of 5 stars... Not much rum and less simple syrup than usual.

There was no pepper on the table which would be overlooked at a less expensive place... I grabbed it from the empty table next door.....

I ordered the rainbow trout and it was a 3.8 star of 5 for the fish and the rest of the plate was a solid 4 star at the $24 mark or so...

Donna ordered the campfire chicken and I would give it a 4 star rating. It's about $24

All in all this spot isn't really worth stopping into... Better food is available all over and without walking across Arizona from their parking lot and the. Down and around a whole building into a basement...."
3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"Cool Atmosphere, Good Band, Then Weird Rap/Club Music?

The band last night was actually really good and made for some good background music for our birthday party. Hey really did a great job!

The atmosphere is cool, the ceiling is like a big wooden barn. Above the bar is the old western tin roof bar style. All in all it's got a good feel to it. 

Not much of a cider selection... Reds on tap for $6 per Little cup... They did have Strongbow cans for $6 too which were better... No Angry Orchards or Maynard though... Pretty high priced when you are buying cheap reds in plastic cups for $6 each though... 

If you are at a table you might as well get up and get your own drinks.... We sat down and 15 minutes went by before anyone said anything to us. Then she took the order came back and asked if we wanted a tab and I said we would just pay cash, and asked my total. She didn't know... How do you not know the total for 2 ciders?  

Friends arrived and over the course of 3 more hours only at one time did anyone ask if we wanted anything else so we contributed to work through the crowd to the bar to serve ourselves... 

PS: We have learned never to do a tab after the last Whisky Row experience where we were at the bar only 4 of us and some other people knocked one of our drinks over and talked to us afterwards for a bit. The bartender then gave them free drinks on our tab all night somehow thinking we were all together and I was everyone's father or something and would somehow pay for anyone who talked to us. My bill was massive and I had only had 2 drinks and Donna had 3 as well..."

Delicious Food! Great Portions!

Friendly husband and wife team make delicious Thai food that makes you want to return every day for lunch and dinner!

The Pad Thai IS AWESOME! This is my normal go to here! It is absolutely great, but that doesn't say enough... This is true happy food and a nice portion size fit for a 220 pound man that likes to eat!

Orange Chicken This is a good kids meal and one of the few things here I don't think is made better by spicy add ins. This dish is best without any spice. 

Massaman Curry for the lunch speacial was pretty awesome and they even had a soup and salad bar that goes along with it to get you warmed up during weekday lunch hours. Super great flavor!

Drunken Noodles are always a safe bet for people who like a simple and tasty meal. 

Tom Kha is a tasty coconut based chicken soup that comes in a cool platter bowl and is pretty awesome!

The Coconut Ice Cream is often offered complimentary after you dinners and it's SUPER DELICIOUS!

The Thai Tea is huge and tasty! I have them make it with coconut milk since I don't do the dairy thing and it's great!

It's a nice, clean, open layout place with nice quiet music playing and clean bathrooms!

Everyone working here is super nice and takes great care of their guests. Our usually Thai waitress is always literally so nice it makes you feel like family!

I really like this place.... It is one of my very favorite places to eat anywhere in the world. 

Stop by to feed your inner animal and tell them Vladimir sent you!

3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"Worst Sales Person Ever!

I came to buy a brand new Honda Africa Twin. One would think that is the dream customer that comes to buy something right there and move on.

Our sales person walks out 5 foot nine or so tall with a flat brim hat on with hands in his pockets trying to walk like he has some sort of swagger. I tell him I want to buy a motorcycle and would like to test drive it to make sure I like it before I buy it. He gives me a card of another place where you can go to do test drives and I look at him confused. I have never been to a dealer it that will not let you test drive when you're standing there with cash in your pockets.

The sales guy with an extremely condescending tone tells me to buy the motorcycle so I can test drive it and then return it if I don't like it. That's is crazy!

So I asked him how much it would cost for the motorcycle with tax and all fees out the door. He refused to answer my question instead saying well are you going to buy it. I told him I would need to know what it would cost before I buy it and usually I like to test drive something also.

After some back-and-forth nonsense I decided no motorcycle is worth the amount of drama and stupidity that I was experiencing at Western Honda. I left and will never come back again and strongly recommend that no one ever visit this establishment.

Now I am going to another dealer to buy the bike right now.

Note to the management; hire better sales people that don't aggravate the customers and maybe train them to never be rude to someone that's trying to spend $15,000 at your store.

Note to the public... This isn't the place to shop!"

Well Donna found a Groupon.... As many of my reviews begin...Lol... 

We decided to try out this office since they had a good Groupon and we both have back injuries... I was pretty skeptical about the situation since I am skeptical about all situations... Lol... 

After 6-7 visits to this office my back has actually improved to the point of almost half of the pain gone! I am really surprised and yes there is still pain, but I can move much easier now and it is far less miserable! 

I have been getting the adjustments from Dr. Robinson for almost 2 months with the trigger point massage afterwards to work out the knots since I have a knotty back... lol... Dr. Rob twists and turns me to pop things into alignment and at the end does the ever dreaded neck cracking. Ever dreaded because it reminds me of how the army taught us to break necks... lol... Good thing he is a doctor and knows what he is doing! 

I have had 2 appointments now with John the PA and his nice Medical Assistant where I have received lidocaine shots and this has been a great added treatment and I cannot really even say enough about the difference the needling and numbing has worked for me. It feels a bit weird when it's being injected but then the next day you feel so much better! 

I am terrible with names or I would mention the massage people also by name for their good work. 

The front desk people and the manger have all also been great. 

The office is clean and smells clean unlike what I read in one review... 

I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by the results so I would definitely recommend this office!"
3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"MEAD IN ARIZONA! Cool, easy to never run across spot!

Feels like an old speakeasy type place. A young man named Cody owns and operated this little gem. He is a friendly guy. 

This is a one man operation with some light duty hours of Friday and Saturday only and 5-9pm only.

Traditional Mead: 14% alcohol. Smooth Delicious Honey Taste With a Tiny Bite! Well crafted simple drink, if you like mead, this is one you will enjoy!

Lemon Ginger Mead: This is a 6.5% alcohol drink that is surprisingly smooth and tasty! I'm not the biggest ginger fan since most of the time it's so strong but what a good job they did here! This one is likely to be the favorite for many people!

Raspberry Mead: 14% alcohol. Nice Aromatic Mead! I like the slight berry scent and smooth raspberry taste mixed with tasty honey goodness!

Caramel Cyser: 8.7 alcohol. This honey-apple wine has a moderate carbonation. Somewhat fizzier honey flavor with slight tint of caramel, not an extremely obvious caramel flavor, just a nice touch. 

Green Apple Cyser: 8.7% alcohol. A new favorite, imagine if you will something with an apple yet much smoother and stronger than angry orchard with honey also taste! This is so much better than angry orchard or most commercial ciders. This one is carbonated mildly which is nice!


Jun: Fermented tea. I'm not well versed in Jun, but it seems like kombucha but better tasting.

Chai Vanilla Jun: Surprisingly smooth! Tasty little drink!

Raspberry Lime Jun: I liked it, not sure how to describe it, other than tastier than kombucha like what you get in stores...  


All in all I like the atmosphere here and the mead. A nice spot to get together."

Best all around climbing gym in Arizona!

We have been coming here for about 8 years. I'll make sure and post a bunch of pictures soon to update the photo gallery!

I really like the downstairs level with the huge overhang and archway! It's not just flat walls here, there are overhangs and inclines, declines... Pretty good all around gym. 

The upstairs is for bouldering as is the entryway. So there is a good amount of square footage for bouldering!

This is a nice husband and wife owned gym and they are super nice people who spend more than 12 hours a day here to offer an actual good sized climbing gym with numerous routes both top rope and lead climbing. 

I feel a bit disappointed in many of the people making the 1 Star and horrible reviews about this place. I can see if you don't want to give 5 stars when things are not perfect, but come on people. This is actually a good place. 

I would like to see one simple change of just washing the holds before putting them back up. They start getting a bit rough looking at times. It's not the biggest deal, but a 5 gallon bucket of dawn dish soap and water is an easy upgrade. 

The flooring here is pretty rough and has been for a long time. But it is totally functional and if you consider it's probably $20-30k for new flooring with all the foam in the first floor from what I would expect on a job this size. It's not a simple thing to replace. Think about how many people need to pay for a membership in order to pay for that!

All in all it's not perfect but it is pretty nice and has super nice owners who have always made us feel at home for 8 years or so!"

Since I have been shopping loyally at Best Buy for more than 20 years now it saddens me to have to make a terrible review for them.

I bought new speakers and amplifier and all of the equipment to have them install the amplifier for me on Monday. I brought the speakers home since they are easy to put in and took everything apart in my brand-new Jeep to install them. I bought new speakers and amplifier and all of the equipment to have them install the amplifier for me on Monday. I brought the speakers home since they are easy to put in and took everything apart in my brand-new Jeep to install them.

Once everything was taken apart I realized Best Buy in Tempe sold me the wrong speakers!

Since Best Buy of Tempe is pretty far away for me I went to the Best Buy in Chandler which is much closer. I talked to the people in the back and had two car audio people assisting me, one of whom I am guessing was the manager of some kind who both told me basically I'm out of luck and that they were sorry that someone gave me the wrong stuff but if I want to pay them an extra $200 to install these tiny little speakers that they would bend some weird pieces of metal and make the most ridiculous homemade contraption to hold the tweeters into place that I have ever seen.

I explain to them that a brand-new $45,000 jeep should have proper installation and why would I pay them $200 to install a couple little speakers and make some sort of homemade contraption for it.

They refused to offer any proper remedies so I am now pulling everything out after spending half a day wasted on this. I will return it all tomorrow!

I won't use Best Buy Car Audio EVER AGAIN!"

Blueberry Spaceship Box: 5.5% alcohol content, tasty sweet and smooth blueberry beer. This is one is an easy to drink all day beer. I give it a 9 out of 10 rating for my personal taste buds!

Ethiopian Pour Over Stout: 10.2% alcohol content, Interesting coffee beer with some vanilla taste hidden in there too. At like a Guinness that isn't so thick or strong and more smooth. This is one is an interesting but probably not one to drink all day beer. I give it a 8 out of 10 rating for my personal taste buds!

Fruit lands: 4.8% alcohol content, nice, clean tasting beer with passion fruit and guava accents. Lightly tart and easy to drink all day! I give it a 8.9 out of 10 rating for my personal taste buds!

Roswell's Sure Swell: 5% alcohol content super sour beer! Pineapple and coconut accents and intensely sour! I like it for a one in a night explosion of flavor, maybe not a 6 in a row beer, but definitely unique and powerful! I give it a 7.9 out of 10 rating for my personal taste buds!

Tombstone Double IPA: 8.7% alcohol content, IPA with a hazy hoppy kind of flavor. Good zingy flavored beer with a little bitterness mixed with a flavorful attitude. I give it a 8 out of 10 rating for my personal taste buds!

A New Motorcycle Is Always Fun! 

I wanted to get a Honda Africa Twin for a couple years now, but I couldn't bring by self to buy the blue and white and red and blue colored ones in 2017 and wanted to wait until they fixed the suspension. We 2019 is here and they have black and Honda improved the suspension so here I am at Ride Now! 

5 Stars --- Andrew Swayze eagerly greeted my and was friendly. He was still in training so Cesar Estrada is his manager and he assisted the process to make sure everything went well. They got my questions answered except if I could add Honda cruise control on our new bike. I forgot about that until now... 

They took my friendly taunting about disliking the buying process and not wanting to go back and forth and got it taken care of for me and I got the deal I wanted. I had tried to buy a bike years ago from Ride now off Country Club but left because of the high doc and processing fees. They do still have those fees, so you just need to negotiate the price to compensate. 

- 1 star --- Doc Fees: As I mentioned they have pretty high and flat rate doc fees so if you are trying to buy a $2,500 little dirt bike for your kid this place will not work at all since you will somehow reach $4,000 after all the fees and taxes which then makes no sense. If you are buying a more expensive bike it won't seem as crazy. I would imagine this kills their ability to move the less expensive items! 

The finance manager was friendly and didn't try to push overly hard to sell warranties and things. 

All in all I will return here again and look Andrew and Cesar up next time I am looking again...

3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"Bought a $7,000 flatbed, Drama City, Install was days late, And more issues...

So I bought a new $70,000 truck and got a $7,000 flatbed installed here at big Tex from our dealer. The dealer told us when to come for the truck so we did excited to add another new truck to our fleet.

Apparently bolting the bed on took a couple extra days and we kept getting a run around. We had to get a hotel room for 2 more days and wait in Phoenix to bring the truck home. All they have to do is bolt it on and run the wires, the beds are already made by CM.

We had the truck a few weeks and got pulled over for no mud flaps and the DOT officer told us he would give us a warning but to talk to the dealer since the truck is required as a commercial vehicle to have mud flaps before it is even sold.

We called Chapman Dodge and were put in touch with with Loren who is the manager of Big Tex to remedy the situation. I told him we would stop in and grab the flaps next trip down to Phoenix since it would take too long to have them install them and we would do it ourselves. 

I drove down to run errands and went to get the flaps, I got this nasty set of too small mud flaps with no framing to keep them off the hit exhaust that melts them. They looked like hey were used for 5 years already too. They were not long enough to be legal either. Just some old junk from the shelf.

I had stopped here before to look at trailers, but ended up getting better prices at other places. 

I'm don't with this place. I don't like wasting my time or being disrespected or neglected by a business.

3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"SCAM WARNING! It Started Odd, Then Things Went Sideways... 

So the time for the 6 month teeth cleaning came and I decided to make use of a great Groupon for a $29 cleaning! I was motivated and Donna bought one too and we made our way over there. When you don't have dental insurance finding a deal is great! But is it really a deal or just a rouse to get unsuspecting people to think they will get a deal. 

We each went into different exam rooms and there were more X-rays than I have ever had before! Then photos of my teeth and then photos of me next to the wall. I was starting to wonder if anyone was going to clean my teeth. I think they should ask permission before assuming you want all this stuff done. 

Finally we get to the part where the gauge your gum depth and I had 5 teeth that reached number 4 and the rest of my mouth was fine. She said I would need a deep cleaning and they would go over the price with me up front. 

I told my hygienist to do the cleaning I came in for and she said she she would reluctantly but that she wouldn't do my last 5 teeth. 

The office guy comes in after and tells me I need to pay almost $700 for a 30-45 minute 5 tooth cleaning later on. He also had a quote for veneers and a crown all at pretty high prices. Seriously, who would pay $700 to clean 5 teeth!!!

I went and talked to Brock the dentist (With only a couple of years experience most since graduating) and asked why it would cost so much when I am paying cash and he literally told me ""Well, you can't do it at home"" with a chuckle as if I have no choice but to use him. Newsflash, You're Fired! 

They told Donna she needed a $1,400 deep cleaning too! This is crazy! 

This dentist office clearly doesn't want to create a loyal patient base, they would rather price gouge and just lose business.

Start with the bad... you sign a contract and pay the $2,800-$3,200 out of pocket and they are supposed to bill your insurance for the rest. A few months after my braces were off we started getting these annoying phone calls from Ortho-Fi which is apparently some company related to or that processes payments for this office. 

We called our insurance company to see why suddenly we are supposed to pay $700-$800 more after insurance was supposed to pay their part. The insurance company said that the office had submitted the bill incorrectly and they told us what to say to frost to get them to submit it so our insurance would pay. 

No matter how many times we called Frost's office they always seemed annoyed on the phone and just expected us to pay rather than tell them to do their job to get paid how our contract had laid it out. Nobody ever calls us back to update us, we just got enough calls from Ortho-Fi to get me to feel changing phone numbers was easier.

The day my braces were installed... I was surprised at how organized and efficient everyone was. They put everything together in a short amount of time and really have the system down...

The assistants here are pretty stellar, it would be difficult to pick a better crew.

Dr. Frost as always was professional and really seems to know his stuff... Not that he wouldn't after around 25 years of doing it.... But he does a great job.

All in all I have to admit getting braces wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The end result is good and having a nice set of teeth is something I should have done earlier. 

I had given them 5 stars before and after this fiasco and feeling like they would rather hustle me for more money rather than submit the bill properly to insurance I have reduced my recommendation to a go somewhere else."

One day I got chest pains and got really dizzy and disoriented. I thought I better look into this. So my primary care provider referred me to this office. 

My cardiologist here was Dr. Einhorn. He was a friendly man in my 1 time meeting him during my 4 or so visits to this office. He is very careful not to give you much detail until your tests are done as to not give you misleading information. This also means it feels like little information is given to you during the process. 

The phone situation at this office is frustrating to say the least. I have only been able to call one time out of more than 12 attempts and actually talk to a person. Inevitably I find my way to Dr. Einhorn's voicemail which states your call will be returned in 24 hours which is more like 72 hours and you will get a missed call from the office. One time I called because I was having chest pains and no one ever called me back at all!

All in all the office is clean and appears organized, but I would have preferred to have received slightly more information and was to this information. 

I was worried about my heart and it felt like to everyone else it wasn't important enough for their time. 

My EKG showed 3 abnormal results, no further information was provided. 

My Stress Test showed my I am not as young as I once was and need to get in shape! Other than that they said it was fine. I felt pretty dizzy, but I guess that's ok... 

My Echo Cardiogram showed It turned out I have a regurgitating ventricular valve which apparently isn't going to kill me for 50 years, and I'll be long dead by then...

I've been attending sierra auctions for about 10 years, maybe even longer! I've gotten many really good deals here on lots of different things from tools, vehicles, shelves for the garage, and even a bunch of guns!

I haven't been to this auction house in quite a while, at least a year! It seems there are a bunch of new people working there now, where are used to know a lot of the original people as I shopped here almost every auction.

The girls in the office are always friendly and have a good sense of humor which makes the experience more pleasant.

My experience as a buyer here I would say it is 85% positive. The only complaint can be the long lines of people as this auction company does their best to try to get through the horrendous crowds on an auction day. I usually prefer to pick up all my auction goods the day after to avoid the terrible crowds.

My experience as a seller only occurred one time. I gave them over $100,000 of jewelry for a high-end jewelry auction they did a decent job and sold about 60 to 70% of what I brought them. My complaint is that well I had the most expensive products in their auction and they made a fortune literally selling my little bit of stuff, they were absolutely unwilling to negotiate on the high commission rate that would be more acceptable if I was selling things that were less expensive and not as worth their while. One of my items they made over $3000 commission alone on which it sort of seems a bit excessive considering my products were the biggest player for quality in that auction. Normally auction houses give you a good deal if you are regular buyer and also bringing in items of value that are sure to sell.

All in all this is definitely a worthwhile auction to buy from you just need to make an informed decision as to what you're willing to pay for a commission and then evaluate how well you think they will market your goods to ensure that the premium amount possible is earned from the sale."

The trouble is doing business itself with this studio.

I politely asked Eric for a refund and to cancel since I didn't even know where my kids were at the time and I didn't want to be out all that money. 

I was told ""The contract says no refunds, there is nothing I can do."" By Eric who is the owner... He absolutely refused to budge and was abrasive with me. As a person who has owned businesses I know this is a cop out and in my situation at the time was a painful hit. 

A person with a heart would usually feel a parents pain and understand some circumstances are beyond control and would not steal someone's money.

For a teacher that tells his students to ""have honesty in their hearts"" he didn't have a problem stealing from me and being greedy with my money. 

I give him 4 out of 5 stars as a children's instructor.

I would give less than 1 star for his customer service and honorable business ethics.

I wouldn't recommend giving him more money until the next month is due and watch out for the extra fees..."
3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"Started Off Rough

So I found this place on Groupon and thought why not try it out... I'm not a video game guy at 38 years old so anything like this is new to me. 

So the rough part is that I drove to check it out and arrived to find they have a summer camp all week which means no regular customers until after 5pm which to be honest annoyed me...

The kid with the white spot of hair was friendly about it and seemed to feel bad about it. 

I decided to hang out and have some food and hike the hill next door and then come back after 5pm and try again. 

So I came back at 5 PM and they put me into the headset and I tried a little robot shooting outerspace game which is definitely didn't seem very fun in all honesty. So I ended the game and went into a different game which was some sort of Arizona zombie hunting in a mine game. 

This game had potential but it was frustrating because you had it try to start the generator and find flashlights and things but there wasn't much of an instruction so I basically wasted my whole 15 minute experience and didn't actually do anything. The girl said she gave me an extra five minutes which makes 20 minutes and all I did was engage two steps of the first scenario and couldn't get anywhere because I couldn't figure out how to turn the lights on.

Long story short, I'm sure kids would think this is pretty cool and even adults probably if they knew what they were doing. If you are like me and don't know about video games then this won't be much fun because you'll try and try to do what you're there to do and your time will just run out and you won't even be able to do anything you'll be stuck in the game.

This will probably be a lot more fun in 10 more years when technology advances and you can put a suit on or something and have things make a little bit more sense.

Nothing like waiting around for a couple hours to kill time to do something that after you do it you didn't even get to do it.

And the girl that helped me was probably the most positive part of the experience. She was super friendly and tried to be helpful but me being old and not having any idea about games made it all the more difficult for her and me both. She seemed to really mean well and I think she felt bad that I didn't really get the hang of it."
3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"New Review: Smooth Service Experience With Marc Ray

After my prior service experience I was not feeling very satisfied with much in the service department. Mike Ellis, who is the service director at Chapman Dodge reached out to me. He apologized for my bad experience and asked me to give them another try. Well, I had another service engine light on and still needed the alignment from last time so I dropped it off again.

Marc Ray was my new service advisor and he was polite and professional. He took note of what we needed done, got me a rental car set up and I was on my way. I picked the truck up today, running like a champion of liberty and ready to get back to work. Looking forward to seeing how the new alignment holds up! 

This round in service was 5 stars so I upped my rating from before being low to a now averaged 4 star review. 

If you are heading into service here I would ask for Marc Ray... He did a solid job. Thanks Marc Ray and Mike Ellis! 




Prior Review: Service Department Frustration

We set up an appointment to drive 4 hours for service from the dealer we bought the dodge 5500 from so it would get fixed in a timely manner since there are no closer dodge dealers.

Service Advisor Travis McMaster, master of disaster? 

The 9am appointment didn't mean much since it didn't get worked in until the following day. They apparently resolved the pre-recall fuel rail issue, but we had to pay $80 for a new fuel filter when we put a new fuel filter in the week prior because of a ""bad o-ring"". I guess replacing the o-ring was too simple.

More frustrating is the front right wheel is really out of alignment and we asked for an alignment and swap the tire. They charged me to swap the tire and said they didn't have time to align the truck, so they switched the tire back so we didn't wreck the new one. 

So here I am, now I have to find a place to have this truck serviced again, somewhere that can align the one wheel so it doesn't burn the outside of tires up. Then I get to pay again for the tire to be swapped. 

Appointments for companies like our are crucial, we have employees that get paid to drove 4 hours south to you for service and then we end up paying for 2 days hotel because small repairs cannot be accomplished in a timely manner. 

Frustrating!"
3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"Best Lebanese Food and Shawarma Ever! Bad Service From One Waiter Ruins It All!

We found this place through a Groupon deal years ago and and I like Lebanese food so of course I was ready to try this spot out! After years of eating here now and this became my favorite restaurant enough to have some birthday parties here over the years and lots of date nights!

Jalapeño Hummus is a nice way to start off! Great flavor and just the right amount of spicy to it! Delicious!

The Shawarma Combo is the most wonderful explosion of wondrous flavor ever! I eat lots of shawarma and even make my own. The combo for two is quite exceptional to the point of being rather excellent, quite possibly even outstanding!

I get the pot of Turkish coffee and 

The Tiramisu for desert makes a nice finale to a nice evening. 

Good music everyday.... 

Live belly dancing Friday and Saturday nights makes an event out of dining!

They have a bar here if you want to get your drink on....

THE BAD PART: The one male server who has been here forever literally takes this place from 5+ stars down to 3. I have not been able to go eat here anymore because of him. I feel like he is going to spit in our food our something. He always has a grumpy look on his face, is near impossible to get drinks or extra items from and is just downright unhappy every time we have been there. 

This grumpy guy is always there too. Sometimes we would get someone else and we would be so relieved. The last trip in I went to complain since he would not come to our table to take our money for the bill to a girl sitting at the bar with a Mijana shirt who then gave me a bad attitude when I asked to pay and said our server was really rude. She defended him like they are dating or something. So I never went back. Keep in mind there were customers at only 3 tables somebody was working too hard to be stressed like when it's packed here.

I haven't eaten here in 2019 almost at all. I was talking to a friend who also felt the same way and felt bad for this place. 

THE GOOD SERVICE: We have met the ow er and his son and they are both very welcoming. I actually didn't want to change my review because they are so nice but they should know this guy is a huge problem. place suffering for one bad apple. 

Stop by and tell them Vladimir sent you bit hopefully no grumpy guy!"
3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"Great Tool Rental, Unmotivated Pro Desk

So this is my second review for this particular Home Depot store. On my second trip and I wanted to return a sheet of plywood and a few little things that were left over from a job site that I didn't want banging around in my truck for the rest of the day. Normally you go into the pro desk when you are a pro customer and they handle all of this for you as well as the new stuff you need for your next job.

This is the first Home Depot where the lady at the register was not interested in bothering with me at all. She sent me down across the store with the lumber and a few supplies I wanted to return to go to the regular returns I'll. But all the Home Depot's I have been to this is the first time someone just didn't seem interested in bothering helping me.

The young man at the return desk was very friendly and helpful though. He got the job done with a smile and was very polite and I was on my way.

Another good mention for this store is the older gentleman who was in the army that works in the tool rental department. He was extremely friendly, super professional, and an overall pleasure to do business with as I rented my floor grinder for the day. This goes to show that there are some good people at the store but maybe some people just aren't as motivated as others.

So the young man at the returns station and the older gentleman into a rental and the store an extra star from my last review which was another disappointment. So good job to the two guys who did a good job.

First review:

I just wanted 4 new doors Too Slow, I Gave Up...

The Home Depot website crashed I was trying to get some prices on new doors. 

I drove by and thought I would pop in to Home Depot and get some door prizes quick and easy. 

I journeyed back to the door and window department where there was a girl and a man sitting in the department doing something or other. The girl apologized a couple of times in a row for the wait. 

They told me it would just be a minute then they walked away and I never saw them again. I gave up since I have more important things to do with my day then wait for a half an hour at Home Depot for someone to talk to me.

It seems Home Depot's everywhere are sliding downhill and it takes too much effort to get people to assist you now. It was not always the case..."
3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"WORST SERVICE EVER! SCAM!

I would never recommend using San Tan Ford's service department EVER!

I have had 2 terrible experiences here which goes to show you fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. 

My first experience was having my SUV alignment done here. I dropped it off for the day and came back to pick it up and paid and was told they made minor adjustments. I pulled out and onto the 202 freeway and the truck went crazy out of control and jerking the steering. 

I pulled over fast as this was pretty scary and looked under the truck and found they forgot to put the nuts back onto my tie rods and it's amazing I didn't crash. 

I went back and they at first asked if I did anything to he truck in the 10-15 minutes since I left. I said of course not.... they said they didn't know how it could have happened to be heir fault since a second mechanic checks work before it leaves. 

Irregardless they screwed the nuts on and I went home.

THE WORST TRIP was when my transmission wasn't going into overdrive with only 8,000 miles on it from another shop. San Tan Ford told me it was the transmission again after charging me around $450 to diagnose the problem. 

They quoted to replace it and I told them I would see the other shop that put it in since it had a warranty. I brought it to the other shop and they said the transmission was testing fine and that it was electrical. 

I called San Tan Ford and they said the transmission shop was scamming me and didn't want to do the warranty. I got really mad at the transmission shop and argued on the phone after the so called ""experts assured"" told me I went to a bad shop. 

I brought it to another diesel shop where they said it was an electrical problem stemming from inconsistent voltage produced by the alternator and that Ford had a service bulletin about this. They charged me $250 total to replace the alternator and the truck was perfect!

I told San Tan Ford afterwards and asked to see the general manager after all the trouble and they had me wait for 45 minutes in the sales area when the service Manager came out and gave me a $220 gift card to service to make up for it. 

$220 to make up for Harding me $450 to misdiagnose and blame someone for a simple problem wrongfully. This and nearly 2 weeks without my vehicle as this all transpired. They didn't even give back my total service fee from this fiasco!

The moral of this story is that San Tan Ford Service Department is a scam. Don't use them no matter what you do!"
3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"Terrible Scheduling And Service, Good Quality Finished Products.

This has been a remodeling nightmare!

We went to Home Depot and picked our color of granite countertops and made our order. They said someone would call and schedule a time for an installer to come make proper measurements and get the process started. Then a week or so later we would get the installation done. 

The install guy comes out and starts recommending upgrades and says ""to do this right"" and so on... he never makes a mention of a price increase just that he ref one day things. So he leaves and weeks go by again and we start calling to see what is happening. Home Depot doesn't know so they call Stone Systems and they said we have to pay another $1,300 which is why they haven't scheduled us. I am irritated at this point and ask why it is more money, they call again and find out the goofball who came out upsold is on a bunch of stuff and didn't ask permission. So we get that resolved and then they say what color did you want again like we didn't pick it and have it in paperwork. 

So after my Home Depot paperwork says the color and what we want we begin getting calls from 3 different companies and a few different people asking if we can go pick the color and asking what we want again. This is getting frustrating. One hand in this network does not know what the other hand is doing. 

Then last minute when we are checking with Home Depot again the lady there asks if we bought new sink drains with the new sink and installation package we paid a bunch for. Apparently they don't tell you when you are buying it and they plumbers would t be able to finish he install without it so we buy the stuff and leave. 

Yesterday the granite went in and Stone Systems did a decent job, it looks how it should but they damaged the heck out of the brand new Sheetrock wall and said it was like that which is impossible. So we have to make calls to get that fixed by someone since they don't care. 

Parker and Sons plumbing is the Home Depot subcontinent tractor for plumbing and they really communicate at 100% along the way. When the guy come to do the work he will leave things unfinished if you don't have a hose clamp for the dishwasher, I fee co fused as to why a plumber wouldn't have simple parts on his truck but whatever...  I went to Home Depot and got what I needed to do what I paid $280 to have them do...

Not quite 2 months later our 2 week project is done. I will never use this Home Depot on Ray rod for countertops ever again,  or will I use stone systems."
3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"Super Fast and Easy Process, Professional and Knowledgable Staff, Just Be Careful In Regards To Billing.

The day my braces were installed... I was surprised at how organized and efficient everyone was. They put everything together in a short amount of time and really have the system down... it really doesn't take much time at all to get your braces done. Each trip in is less than 10 minutes and then you are out the door ready for liquids and soft foods for a couple days after each tightening.... Lol... 

The assistants here are pretty stellar, it would be difficult to pick a better crew. Everyone seems so happy about what they do at work it is almost surprising! Except maybe one of the desk girls... lol... You can guess which one... Everyone else is almost glowing with positive energy. Dr. Frost really picked a great group. 

Dr. Frost as always was professional and really seems to know his stuff... Not that he wouldn't after around 25 years of doing it.... But he does a great job. He tries to stop by and be personable and then he is off the the next patient in a flash. The guy really has it down to a no time wasted process. 

All in all I have to admit getting braces wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The end result is good and having a nice set of teeth is something I should have done earlier. 

Just Be Sure About Billing and that the insurance estimate is only a quote. You sign a contract and pay the $3,200 out of pocket and they are supposed to bill your insurance for the rest. A few months after my braces were off we started getting these annoying phone calls from Ortho-Fi which is apparently some company related to Frost that processes payments for this office. 

We called our insurance company to see why suddenly we are supposed to pay $700-$800 more after insurance was supposed to pay their part. The insurance company said that the office had submitted the bill incorrectly and they told us what to say to frost to get them to submit it so our insurance would pay. 

After we called Frost's office twice they always seemed like it was annoying we disagreed with the bill. Nobody ever called us back to update us until I changed my 5 star review and added comments. We just got enough calls from Ortho-Fi to get me to feel changing phone numbers was easier.I had given them 5 stars before 

Derek ended up calling us after being my updated yelp review and he got it straightened out. Derek was professional when taking to my wife and she felt happy with his service. So I am glad we got it resolved, but it would have been better if the problem hadn't happened or at least it didn't take so much effort to resolve it. 

All in all, Dr. Frost and his people are a pretty good group. I cannot stress enough to be mindful of the billing process. Other than that I feel Dr. Frost is probably one of the best in his field."
3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"Well I came for what would have been expected to be a quick visit for 4 small issues to make me safe to keep going on the road with a truck I just bought. 

Rayce was my service advisor and Paul was my mechanic. 

#1. My turn signals and brake lights worked but the running lights were not working when I plugged my trailer in. Without a trailer the circuit would reset and work fine so I asked for them to start by replacing the trailer connector on the truck first to see if it would help. 3 Hours later the tech had looked at possibly every other wire on the truck and not the plug I asked for. Finally the plug was not the problem but apparently a bad wire under the truck... So my guess was incorrect after all. 

#2. The trailer brakes also were not working which also made me believe it was the connector or wires going into it. The power was to the controller and going to the wires in the plug, but not actuating the brakes. It turned out there was a missing all time power wire to the trailer to run the pump for the hydraulic brakes. The tech ran a power wire and that was that.

Since it took 3 hours to find the first one wire problem I asked for status updates every hour or so while I was waiting and walking around outside to kill time it seemed I was bothering the service writer even though he was not on the phone or doing too much. I don't think they guy was trying to be rude, but I was getting anxious as the labor rates were building up...

#3. I had an air leak for my airbag leveling system where the air lines go in and out of the leveling controller? (not sure what it is called) on the frame. We didn't get that done for lack of a part for this trip. 

#4. My trailer axles were out of alignment from the factory by more than 1.2""!!! They fixed that super quick and that is a relief... Apparently PJ Trailers does not have great quality control!

When you are paying anywhere near $100 an hour you really want to see progress and feel respected and know your money is buying services and not merely time taking that builds your bill.

I would recommend this place but as with anywhere do your due diligence and pay attention to what is going on. There must be faster service somewhere. Paying that much for service means the customer has a right to feel frustrated to see the tech talking to other techs leaning on the truck talking and taking so much time. 

3 hours to diagnose a wire seems crazy since we knew which wire it must have been as it controls the running lights only. One could have replaced the entire wire in less time. I feel that was quite a lot of labor for that issue. 

My other issues were resolved in a reasonable time. All in all I can continue in my trip now with less worry. 

Rayce worked with me in some of the labor for the long diagnosis and I appreciate that a bunch. That was worth the 4th star!

In summary, a quick fix can be costly here or anywhere if you have bad luck or less than speedy diagnosis! One experience cannot judge a place based on one visit but I also cannot give a super awesome recommendation either."
3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"Always a good experience at this Home Depot. Whether I am buying tile to remodel my floors or getting paint or some landscaping supplies for the yard.... This Home Depot always gets the job done. 

Johnny Carson was super great today in the Pro Department. It was my first time working with him and he was extremely friendly and helpful! I will definitely come back to work with him again in the future!

The manager in the granite countertop section who helped me was friendly. I didn't get her card so I forgot her name but she is from Riverside California and was great and had a good sense of humor.

The lady last night in the tile section was super nice too. We got the tile order in and taken care of with easeIt's cool that you can ask for help and people help you make sure you get the right stuff!

3R_dB9VQ_D3WPJEw7pmorA,"Six Flags Needs Some Love..... Maintenance... 

So I am a big Six Flags Fan... I am also a big fan of fun and places specializing in having fun! This is also as I believe the largest waterpark in Arizona by size of land. 

I really want to leave a better review and took some time to decide what rating to give. It is a fun park, but this last trip in was the worst shape I've seen it in so far. 

There are some great rides here like: 

Big Kahuna 
Typhoon Twister
Anaconda 
Mammoth Falls 
The Tornado 
Wahoo Racers 

That being said, this particular park really needs some help in a few areas:

1. Out Of Order: My favorite waterslides are the Bahama Blaster Slides, the ones in the back corner that are seemingly always out of order. They are the jet powered water slides and they are awesome when they work. They had one running today finally, but not the other so the lines are crazy long! 

2. The Tornado: I like this ride despite its long wait times and constant tube lift malfunctions. TODAY HURT ON THIS RIDE. THE TUBE WAS UNDERINFLATED AND MADE STAYING ON NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE SO MY ARM DRAGGED ON THE SLIDE AND RIPPED THROUGH MY SWIMMING SHIRT AND MY ELBOW! THE OTHER GUY ON OUR TUB HIT HIS HEAD SUPER HARD FOR THE SAME REASON WHICH WAS SCARY! Other than that, You can only go on it once a day or you will spend too much time waiting in line. We opted not to even try ride 2 on this one today. 

3. Wahoo Racers: The 6 rider slides to the right of the entrance have 2 out of order signs and are filthy at the bottom when you get to the end. The water is full of dirty stuff. Doesn't feel clean. 

4. Understaffed? No lazy river today apparently because there are not enough lifeguards? Bummer... It's a good spot to hand out and relax. 

5. Garbage: Why are there overflowing dumpsters of garbage along the back wall where you just see them more more than a month looking nasty? broken chairs and tubes tumbling out of over filled dumpsters that were there today and last month (5 weeks ago) and look like a lot longer. 

6. Water Leaks Everywhere: I feel like some silicone and a few hours every night of proper maintenance and the pumps and slides wouldn't need to spills what I would guess is hundreds or thousands of gallons of water each day all over. 

7. Dining: We don't eat at this location.... The Main dining area is always filthy inside. I know it would be difficult to keep it clean with all the people dripping in and pigging out but cleanliness is important... 

8. Confusion: Apparently parks must dummy proof all things... Today we witnessed a crazy argument between several groups of unrelated people and a crazy 30 something year old tattooed guy who didn't understand there were 2 lines for 2 different slides on the same stairs. The guy actually tried to fight a 10 year old little boy so I stepped between them. It was CRAZY! Maybe some paint or a tape divider line would help people know which side of the line to line up on regarding the stairs with more than one slide type at the top. The staff did a good job at trying to defuse the situation and cannot be faulted for a crazy customer, but what a weird situation! 

All in all there is potential here at this park but this was my first time getting a minor injury at any six flags and also almost watching a 50 year old man get literally knocked out. 

It makes me sad to have to write such a rough review of this place. Either they are borderline going out of business at this location and have no budget or there is no management at this park that actually pays attention. It would not cost much to remedy many of the issues here."

Purple Heart: 7% alcohol, cascara, butterfly pea flower flavored cider. Dry and sweet at the same time. I'm not sure what the flavors are when I drink this one. My personal palate rating give this one a solid 7.5 out of 10 for awesomeness!

There is also a pizza place inside but we didn't try them out since we ate before we got here."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"Being a cookie kind of girl and skeptical in general of ""Best Of"" food lists I smiled and thanked politely when tons of people talked and wrote about this place. I silently smiled when my friends asked, ""Have you been to WCAD?"" ""Not yet"" was my polite response. I was really thinking, ""Ummm, no, and I never will."" I peacefully read article after article and Best Of lists that hailed their almighty Key Lime Donut. Nope, not going unless they have cookies. I silently doubted all the claims. However, when my Foodie friends starting talking I sat up and took notice. I jotted it down on my Spring Break, local Staycation food tour list. 

Cookie monster was busy today so I dragged my rear out of bed on the second day of Spring break and drove the 15 miles or so to get there. Okay, I had errands in the area. You'll never know, wink! I might or might not drive many miles for good food in Az. I'm not telling.  

Well, forget the donuts. Let me tell you, the one piece Chicken breast combo with Thai Slaw and sauce number 1 was freaking, seriously delish!  Holy Heck, (chicken)  in a hand ( cardboard) basket! Get that, okay?

""The donuts?"" you ask, ""How were the donuts?"" Well here is how that went. I bought a half dozen of the upgraded donuts. I got their signature Key Lime Pie one of course. I wanted to try the Irish Bomber and Chocolate Almond one but they were sold out. Insert sad face. Happy face come back.  The very lovely lady behind the counter threw in a red wine covered something or another as a recommendation, and I ordered a chocolate and an Arnold Palmer Thai Lemonade to boot.  They cost me a weeks paycheck though. Seriously $12.50 for 6 donuts, ouch! I spent my entire spring break food allowance. Sigh! After all was said and done I might or might not be a donut convert, just saying. Sorry Cookie Monster I have a new BFF!

But here is the interesting part I honestly thought just the plain cake donut they gave free with the meal was way better than the upgraded donuts. It tasted better and was free with a meal. You can tell the quality of the donut without all the goodies and stuff on on it. So surprisingly I liked the food here better than the desserts. 

By the way, they have one of the best cups of coffee I have had in Phoenix. Just a regular Joe please. So hard to find in Phoenix.

Finally, the staff members are super nice too. And those errands you ask?  Well, never happened because now that it is 90 degrees in March I couldn't let the leftovers spoil, now could I?"
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"The girls who worked here upped it from three stars to four. They are super sweet! This poor place and me seemed to have a love hate relationship from the start. I have been trying to go here for a while but something always happened. It was closed, we decide to go elsewhere, my car broke down, etc. Well, today I was determined to use my Restaurant.com gift certificate to go. I had errands to run in the neighborhood too so I looked up the opening time and was promptly there at 9:00 am. Well, they were not open even though that is the time listed on their website and the front door. I then notice there is a little sign under the door etchings that say that they are not really open until 10am on Saturday. ""Arghhhhh,"" Jinxed again. lol-- okay so I leave and do some more errands and come back. I am at the door at 10am and it is still not open. If I was not a determined person and a stubborn New Yorker when it comes to trying new food places, they probably would have lost a customer. 

   The gal working there shows up at 10:02am and opens up. Their staff do not show up 30 minutes or more early so you might want to note that when you go. I then see that they have a fantastic Yelp check in deal too. Which deal to use? Decisions, Decisions? For some reason the internet is not allowing me to reopen the saved Yelp deal. No biggie, I go back to the Restaurant.com deal instead. (by the way this was an awesome deal for sure! 2 sandwiches for 5 dollars, 2 cookies and a drink too.) 

   The place is small and sweet with a cute sidewalk area too. The food was good, not great. I liked the sandwiches I had so I want to go back and try them all. Unique menu. I do feel the sandwiches are not overstuffed though. ( but I always think Carnegie Deli when I hear the words overstuffed sandwiches) I think their Chicken Salad is very good. One of the better ones in town. I also got a Charlie Brown to go. (Roast Beef and Cukes, ""Meh"" but how do you spice that up? ) I liked that they have Onion Rolls. I love Onion rolls. Yummy!!!!! Still not as good as NY ones though but what is? -lol ;) The cookies I had were good. ( Again, not great or to die for) 

   I liked the place and would definitely go back despite the messy way I finally got to enjoy it. lol. Since it is local owned I have to try to support local business. The food was good enough for me to want to keep coming back. I just think they should work out some of the kinks. 

   A special thank you to the two nice ladies working the counter."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"We have had season tickets to the Pops series for three years now. We love us our music! Last night we saw again the wonderful jim Witter who did a tribute to one of my favs of all times, Simon and Garfunkle. ( I know every word to every song they ever wrote. Yes I know nerd alert here) JW usually does a Billy Joel and Elton John tribute. Ha! Last year I even got to sing and dance on stage to Crocodile Rock. Na-na-na-na-na  Na-na-na-na-na!  Don't ask, but life goal number 1 completed! LOL! Well as far as last night goes, all I can say is that we were rocking the place. ( Well ok as far as one can rock out to Simon and Garfunkle) I am sure the conductor was cringing at how rowdy the third row was. Teeehhhee! We were jamming out to the music. 
( Yes sorry handsome conductor man. I know it is the Symphony and probably made you cringe with all that classical training in the house. Then the NY, Alice Cooper gang hooligan types came in-hahaha thus why I like the Pops more than the classical. I will go to classical shows too so really I am just kidding. However. I do love the pops so much more. I know, I know, I feel like ""Just Jack"" from Will and Grace. I love me my musical theater and showtunes, Gleek here.  
   Last year I even got to see my all time musical theater hero diva perform,  Patti Lupone. SIGH! Got to meet her after the show too. Thanks Phoenix Symphony for that photo op! (Life goal number two, check!) Advice, now if you could only get Mandy I would truly be in heaven. ( Life goal check number 3 perhaps?) 
   However, I do went to point out they do have something for everyone with an eclectic yearly calendar of different musical genres. I do worry about cultural Arts programs and budget cuts in Az so hope people continue to support them in any fashion. I know it is not NY or London but it's still good!  I also love it when I see the young set being introduced to the Symphony. We sat next to a delightful 13 year old young man last night. He was rocking out with us. ( Ok Dad listens to S/G in the car every day. But at least the boy didn't  appear to be having his teeth pulled out by being there)  So to all of my fellow music lovers, check it out, support local Arts, and enjoy!

Oh an afterthought- The person who sings with Jim ( can't remember his name) does the meanest, most awesome, best impression of Edith Bunker ever. I have no idea how a man can even hit a high note like that. If you ever have the chance to see him do this I would strongly advise you to do so. It is so fun!"
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"i had been wanting to write an update of I-hop for a little while and last nights abysmal visit was the motivation I needed to do so. Perhaps I do not understand the concept. Are they a self serve restaurant? Literally, I actually got angry eating here last night. I never do that nor like to give such a low review. Especially to a place that supports educators and nonprofits. 

There were 4 servers working last night and only three tables were filled when I entered and no hostess. Off to a bad start. The wait on a dead night should be less than a minute. Then ( it was a night of thens) the server took too long to get to me after I was seated. The Entree came before my salad ( why?)  and not once did anyone stop by to ask me how I was doing. Another thing they do here, that I just do not understand, is that they do not clear dishes or refill glasses away. I have noticed this on several visits even at out of state I-Hops and it perplexes. me. There is no excuse for leaving dirty dishes on a table in front of a customer for 45 minutes 

The part that made me upset was my server totally disappeared for 45 minutes. I am not exaggerating either. It time stamped at 45 minutes and I never saw him once on the floor. When he finally came out he walked  to the hostess stand and started talking to a lady who had just walked in. He then talked to her for even 10 more minutes without helping nor sending anyone else over to my table. Do you think he would have asked the other servers to check on me, get me a refill, or give me my check? Nope! I had to ask for a togo box from another server who also walked by my table about ten times and never even asked me a thing. (Not my table type of thing.)  And then when he finally came over he acted like it was no big deal. He totally forgot our earlier extensive conversation on a  dessert order and did not even apologize for making me wait 45 minutes to leave. I left without a further food purchase just to get out of there.  

Even stranger he was a super nice person. I had no issue there with any of the staff. They are all very friendly. He really had no idea that he owed me an apology or that I was waiting that long. 

This is not the first time this has happened. I am not sure I understand how they run this restaurant. Do they have a different philosophy on table service maybe that I am unfamiliar with? With all the new and hot breakfast places out there these days how do they stay open? They are not that cheap nor high quality on the food chain. Sad to say, I am not coming back here again."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"I was a little nervous reading the reviews about kids in bars which is not okay and not like one Yelper wrote, ""innovative"" by the owners. Hire a babysitter if you want to go out to a bar. A non supervised play area in a bar is frightening concept to this teacher.  However, it was my BFF's birthday and this is where we were going so I bit the bullet.  

I was pleasantly surprised. There were no kids there on a Saturday at 8pm. I was thrilled about how much fun we all had. One of the owners/investors hung out and joked around with us for a little while, and the service was great! The place is more like a ""U"" shaped restaurant then a bar, and looked to have a pretty patio although I never made it out there. We loved the band that was playing. ( ""The Real Thing."" Boy, those gals can sing. Check em out)  We even made our own dance floor and danced the night away, 

The food was yet another surprise. It was good for bar food. The pretzel was amazing! Soft and fluffy with some type of cheesy/hummus/artichoke/whatever sauce that 8 gals had a different opinion on what was in it but all agreed was Super Delish! We also had the Tater Tots, ( Crunchy and flavorful) Teriyaki Wings,( YUM) and a Hummus Duo dish. ( It was ""Okay"" for Ms. Picky on the Hummus here) The drinks were drinks, I mean how do you review alcohol? lol Just kidding, I had a ""Dragons Bite"" which is like a fruit type tasting drink. I tasted the ""Cesar Tangerine"" too. They also have a few ice tea options for the DDs and Teetotalers.

There were a few negatives deducting a star. The valet closed at 9pm. We did not get that at all. The bar died down at around 10:30 pm which is way too early even for AZ Standards forcing us to head next door to JT's for two hours. This is another factor that cements it in my mind they are more like a restaurant, not a bar. They forgot my Yelp check in credit on the final bill, they advertised a special on their website that they did not honor ( a business should always honor these things)  and the back bathroom by the Kiddieland had an issue with the door closing. This might make for an awkward scene for sure if a child or other drunk patron walked in on you.(""Onsie"" stall and the Main door leading to the eating area does not close right. ArcadiaTavern, you need to fix that) 

So, if you want a restaurant atmosphere with sports on the TV's, yummy food, and music, this place is great. If you want a bar atmosphere, maybe not so much. I myself really liked it for what it was. Thank you AT for the fun. You just need to lose the kids area please, Okay?"
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"Why do people come here for such bad service? It is such a mystery to me.  It is always the same bad service. Yes, the food is good but the service is just awful. You would think they would get it together by now. Weird they place is always packed maybe people do not care that they are treated so badly? I have eaten here many times and it is always the same. I think I'm done with this place. 

Update for 12/31/15 and 1/1/16

Early in day NYE
Me- on Phone- ""Hi are you open tomorrow on the holiday? I have out of town guests who want to revisit your place.""
Man who answered phone- I don't know. ( really?) hold on (Does not put me on hold and screams in my ear and across the restaurant apparently to get an answer) "" Yes, we are open."" Dead air space continues. 
Me- ""Ummmm, are you sure? What time?""
Man- Repeat of above scene. By now I am deaf and wanting to drive down to show him where the hold button is located on a phone set.  
Me- ""Anything special going on?""
Man- No. End call. 

I call back and reconfirm they are open. Nothing is said about needing a reservation or a special menu either time. 

Fast forward to 10pm-strangely my phone rings and the number is not one I recognize. i call back and it is Noodle Cafe 

Me- Umm you called me? Are you calling to tell me you are closed. ( I never left my phone number. I thought maybe they were just using Caller Id. ) 
Lady- No, who is this?
Me- Well someone called and I was just wanting to make sure you are still open tomorrow.
lady- I can't imagine who would have called you. ( three seconds later)
Me- in my mind I am thinking it is probably a phone glitch."" Are you calling me back from your Caller Ids from the day? 
Lady- No, do you have a reservation for tomorrow? Is that why you are calling? 
Me- Sighs loudly. ""No you called me. Do I need a reservation for tomorrow? I have never had one here before and we are coming in around noon.  
Lady- No
Me- Are you sure you are open? ( Skeptical)
lady -Yes see you tomorrow. 

Okay, you see where this is going right? Fast forward to New Year's Day. I enter the restaurant and see a sign for their special menu.  Ummm, what special menu?

Me- Hi we are a party of five for noon. I am a bit early. May you put down my name? 
Lady- Do you have a reservation
Me- No
Lady- Sorry we are having a New Year's special and you need a reservation. 

I am a most forgiving person with these things but every single time i visit this eatery there is an issue.

When everyone arrived We left and went to Grassroots, which was fabulous by the way! I will not be returning any time soon to Noodle Cafe, if at all."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"I had a free certificate from a coworker that I finally put to good use.I had airplane neck syndrome-teehhhee! Ok, so here is how this place works. It is a school so do not expect resort, spoil me princess service and amenities. With that said I had better service here then I have had at one of those fancier places that will remain nameless. You go in and give your name. I had always been told you have to wait a  very longtime but I only waited 15 minutes tops. You can't beat the prices here. When you do have to pay and are not lucky enough to have a coupon or gift certificate it is only 25 dollars and they don't allow tips. This is the  most economical massage in town. Now they are students but Angie did a good job for me and was graduating in three weeks so all was well.It is a bit different from a spa, resort, or Massage Envy so heads up. You do not have your own private room. ( But you will get plenty of privacy. I did not feel this was a  problem only different then what I am used to) It is kind of like a big triage center in the Er with all the white curtains and individual room areas and such but no walls. However,  they have it set up so you are tucked into corners and do not have to worry about someone just whipping a curtain open on you.  Since you do not have your private room it is dead quiet all around you because I am assuming people do not want to talk to disturb you. Every now and then you hear whispering. It is also weird to hear the hitting of the therapists hands on the skin of people next to you not being your own-hahaha. The music is a bit to loud for my liking. I assume it is piped in for all to hear and the room is freezing. Now I know all massage rooms are always  freezing but the fancy places 
have warming tables. NO frills here thus the cheap price for a good massage.  I think it is worth it to come here. My neck feels a lot better. I do like a very hard massage but I wasn't sure if you could request a pressure change and to be honest I did not want to freak out the poor girl by telling her to tear up my muscles. LOL. The day I went I lucked out too. They asked for volunteers for a turnaround service massage. I did not do this but how cool was this offer.  When I went to leave the sign on the door said turn around and sign in again for another hour massage for free! They needed more clients. WOW!!!! That would have been a steal if I took advantage of that deal. They also run two for one coupons I hear form my friends. I give this place 4 stars because you will not get 100 percent spoiled like at a spa but the massage was almost equivalent to the ones I have received elsewhere and the price is a steal!"
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"I have taken SS many, many times over the last 20 years and have been very happy with it. I will stick to the Phx area for this review. I have never been late for a flight on the way to the airport, if anything you will get their super early. I'd rather be early then late to the airport anyway. Bring a book.  On the way back I book online and take advantage of a AAA discount. To be honest you can find numerous coupon codes on line if you are adamant about it. The drivers have always been happy, safe, honest and courteous. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that you have to wait at times, a bit at SkyHarbor on the return. For me it is no big deal. I plan that in my trip time since I have no flight to catch. I never book flights back at last minute. However, if you are in a rush or have a place to be then get picked up by a friend or take a taxi and be forewarned. I have caught a shuttle in as little as three minutes and other times have waited 20 or more. 

Example of great driver, last month I took them home from a flight from Denver. The driver had us in stitches over stories he had heard about airline passengers and the strange things they bring aboard their flights. I was skeptical over the Potbelly Pig and Miny pony story until the guy whips out his camera phone and shows me the pictures. Here is the evidence of this huge pig that literally pooped all over the plane and even tried to attack crew and customers. But, hey he is a service pig ya know. (Insert eye roll here) So I digress. The reason I mention is this I am laughing so hard when he pulls up to my home that I apparently left my really cool, wool coat on the floor of the van. So now only in Phoenix would someone not miss their winter coat until like a month later, right?  But alas, on the one really cold night of the year I realize I have not seen this coat since Denver. Sooooo, I initiate a week long search that includes Sky Harbor Lost and Found, Southwest Airlines but to no avail. I am extremely sad to believe my coat is lost forever. I love that coat! Then it dawns on me that I took SuperShuttle home this time. Could it be possible? So I email them and a lovely Margarita calls right back ( a person not a drink) to say that they actually have it. Wow! SS is my hero of the 2012 year end. I am very appreciative to the honest driver and to have my coat back. An added bonus is that Margarita grew up in NY. I am also always happy to have a nice conversation with a fellow New Yorker.

See folks, there are still good people left in the world. Thanks Super Shuttle. I tip my New Years Party hat to you. Now if you could only work on that return wait time I would give you 5 stars for sure."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"It seems like everyone loves Kohls but me. Now, I get that they have Kohls cash and coupons and all. For this reason when I need a bigger purchase like a vacuum, Sketchers, towels, silverware, and or a vacuum I tend to go here because with all the combined coupons it is cheap and even free buuuuuuuuttttttt every time I go it is a pure disaster. Every, single time.

I swear this place is haunted. Every time, every! single! time! Did I mention every time? The store sees me coming and (insert evil laugh) it says to itself, ""Oh here comes Mary. Let us aggravate her to no end and make her shopping experience the worse one eva."" Haha!

Take today for instance. The chip reader did not work. This caused a fraud alert to be put on my banking account. This caused me to have no access to money for a few hours on my only day off in 6 months and just pretty much ruined my day. I had to drive home and then back to get my purchases since the ATM would not give me cash due to the fraud alert. Sigh. Granted maybe not all their fault, but still, like I mentioned, Every! SIngle! Time! Bad Juju for sure.

The thing also that annoys me is the way the store is planned, set up, and built. Who planned the floor space at this location? Why are there columns cutting an already too narrow aisle in half and then all the merchandise packed in? Add a displaced and left out store ladder and you can not even walk down the aisles. Their own carts do not even fit down the aisles. Forget another person wanting to be in the same space as you.  Are they all like this? It is just plain miserable. You can not shop or even walk around without getting bumped into. I leave with bruises on my body.  I just do not see the attraction of Kohls. I can use coupons at Macy's and other stores.  

I gave the store two stars because the workers are always pretty nice.  Kelly saved this review from zero stars to an upped two. She should own the franchise. I had the best Customer Service experience today due to her kindness, patience, and generosity. There is that at least. Silly me will probably go back but I won't enjoy it.

LIsten up Kohls! Get your act together. Remodel or at least do not pack the aisles and people all together in the same area and please hire more staff for Pete's sake.  Lines wrapped around the store and in the shopping aisles is not cool either.

I also noted on several trips that there is at least two inches of black and brown flying dust and debris on the floors in the dressing rooms. Talk about sickening. At first I thought it was black mold. I mentioned it twice before and the next visit still all the rooms were filthy. Do they ever clean the store? I have not stepped in a Kohl's ever since."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"Pretty, Pretty Princesses apply here. The salon is very fancy and pretty. It is almost disgustingly so with hanging chandeliers, Water Fall walls, and a pretty rustic, curving rail stairs. The boutique is pretty. ( I got a killer necklace pretty cheap) The relaxing room and hallways, locker room are all pretty darn nice looking. I would never in a million years think to go here but I received a coupon for a massage for participating in Pat's Run. I was long overdue for a massage and did not want to wait to go to the massage school I usually frequent. I indulged, even with the coupon the price was a bit higher than I can afford on a teacher's salary. The location is not very convenient for me either. What the heck, I work hard. A gal can splurge every now and again.
   I had no problems booking the same day appointment. It is strange that you actually do not get the location you want when you call. You get the Chandler location but that is how they do it I suppose. The gal who answered the phone might have been new or in training.  She did not know directions nor prices 100 percent as well as she should. However, someone was behind her coaching her. I am totally okay with that since she was super nice and answered all my questions. She asked if she could put me on hold, did not keep me on hold for very long, and asked if it was okay if she could inquire from the other person for help. I liked that.
  Getting there was another story. It is a little tricky to find but I finally pulled in at 10 minutes to appointment time. I was greeted immediately and brought up stairs. I was offered a drink and showed the relaxation room. My only gripe was the lady in there talking on the cell phone. It is called the Relaxation Room for a reason. Come on folks, shut it off please. ( this is not the salons fault though and the room is very pretty) I was picked up on time almost immediately after filling out my paperwork. 
   Samantha was my massage therapist. I did not pay for the deep tissue massage.  They did discuss that the Swedish Massage was a light to medium pressure. Samantha did a great job. She seemed to find all the knots. I am super ticklish at times too but all went well. 
   After the massage I was greeted right away by the upstairs cashier and went shopping in the boutique downstairs. Everyone was very friendly and helpful towards me. Another drink for the road too. 
  All in all, this was a very lovely experience. I probably would not go back, but through no fault of the Dolce. The non discounted prices and highly inconvenient locations are prohibitive. Perhaps when they offer a Groupon again I might reconsider or if they opened one up in the Downtown Phoenix/ Biltmore area."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"I hate this place. Ok granted I have only had about 20 pedis in my entire life, and only two other places to compare it with, and my feet are awfully ticklish but I really don't think I am the worlds pickiest, princess. I had been going here for two years  because it is right next to Massage Envy. One stop pampering huh? You would think. and  it took me a while to write a review because I could not put my finger on what it was about this place I hated but I think I have it now. I went 4 or 5 times and I alway felt very uncomfortable here. I wasn't sure why but I think it was because I felt like I was a  member of a cattle herd. In and out, no smile,  no service. They were always in a rush to get me done and onto the next person waiting. Welllllll,  a pedi is a splurge and  a treat to your inner peace and not cheap SOOO, since I am paying you a bit of my hard earned money could you at least act like you like me and or the fact that I am the paying customer? Oh well,  I kind of blew it off and figured all places were like this.( Even though the other two places I had been to in the past were not  like this)  I continued to go because this place was a little cheaper and more convenient.  I went back a few more times until The last time I went in this past winter. That was the last straw. ( Plus they raised their prices!) The girl was so rude to me for no reason known. I was very nice to her and she just kept ignoring me and hurting me. I asked her to go easier and she did not  and rolled her eyes. At the end of the pedicure she did not give me the sandals they usually give for drying time and  tried to put my shoes back on to soon and smeared the polish on my big toe. OMG she acted like it was all my fault. She actually got mad at me! She  rolled her eyes and got really bent out of shape!I couldn't believe it. She huffed and puffed back to get the polish remover and mumbled when she had to repaint my toe. After she repainted my toe she again tried to put my shoe back on without any dry time.  Well somehow my foot tensed up as I tried to help her out by pushing my foot a little into the shoe and she had the nerve to yell at me and slapped my foot. She barked ""STOP IT!"" and told me to cut it out and relax my foot and again with the rolling of her eyes with a side helping of attitude. What is this all about?????Are all pedi place like this I wonder. Follow up- Months later-  Ok, so today my friend tells me she  had a pedi yesterday and the lady told her her feet were ugly. 
(They are not,. She is a gorgeous gal all around. However,  either way HELLO???? Are you really gonna tell your client that? JEEEEEZZ LOUISE).  Lo and behold, yup, you guessed it, the same place! YIKES!!!! RUN AWAY! I went to the place in Spectrum Mall and had a better pedi and it was much cheaper."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"If I can move my fingers fast enough to write in my over stuffed, overfed, eye drooping food coma but happy body, right now I would like to write this review. lol----The only Mexican Restaurant I can say I truly love is Gallo Blanco. I was excited to hear about this cafe from the same folks/chef but with an organic twist. I visited tonight and they were busy. Not so much when I first got there around 6:30ish but it soon started getting packed. I was greeted quickly and had to wait less than 5 minutes for a table. I chose to sit outside. if you like Gallo you will like it here. Maybe more so since I think the hotel location is just bizzare in the form of mood and atmosphere. (Unless you visit the rooftop pool first-lol) At Otro there is a type of a cool, hip, Chelsea /Greenwich Village  arty, beatnik, type of feel to it. The menu seemed the same but the hostess assured me it is not. (More organic options which has been the chef's dream for the past ten years) Oh well! That all sounds good and dandy to me but I always order the same thing because I love their Carne Asada Tortas and Guac so much! ( I swear one day I have to branch out and try some of their other food items) I usually end up taking half home and tonight was no exception.
   I liked the fruity Ice tea, the hot green salsa ( Not so much the smokey, red one. I do not like smokey tasting anything) and yes I ordered my usual for dinner. I had to knock off a star because the bread was slightly burnt on my Torta ( that is a big no-no for me)  and the Guac seemed bland for some reason. Maybe the recipe is different here? With that said, their Guac is still soooooo yummers and I devoured half the Torta anyway. I never said a word nor sent it back so a solid 4 stars it is. However, I am guessing 5 stars on the next visit. Maybe my taste buds were off or something on the Guac but I did not get that citrus bite I love. For some reason I just wanted to keep reaching for a salt shaker. 
   I have to give 5 stars to the Coconut Pudding though. It was a small piece of heaven. I have been trying to make a good coconut creme cake filling at home but it is never correct. It is either yuk; too fake tasting or too sweet, This pudding is to die for. Not too sweet, smooth as silk, delish in a cup sprinkled with dark chocolate shavings. I died and went to Hawaii.
    Michael was my server but the entire staff, more or less, all chipped in and helped. Michael is a nice man and treated me well. Micheal knows what Haupia is so he gets an extra shout out. I have to admit though he was a little too busy at times. It seems other Yelpers agree maybe they need more help here? 
   Thank you Otro for a nice meal. Perhaps, I should be upset that you totally helped me to ruin my diet plan. Welllll, sadly, it took very little arm twisting. Until next time, ""Tiene una buen noche."""
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"Hmmmmm, another place I heard about for years. Movie stars love it! Locals love it! Food critics love it! I am not a breakfast food eater for breakfast so I figured I would never try it. Hey, I am OK with Denny's or McDonalds for Breakfast! I knew I had to go when the gentleman sitting next to me on the plane recently told me that he purposely landed a layover in Phx just to try the darn place. ( I am like,"" Really""? But then I thought I might do the same over a great NY pizza sooooooooo I cut the guy some slack-lol) So when I found myself Downtown yesterday I stopped by. Ok, right away I had issues. Nowhere to park. I found a spot on the street and paid 2 bucks for metered parking.( And worried about a break in since the neighborhood is real bad)  We are not starting off well. I then walked the two blocks to the restaurant. Being 10:30 am on a Tuesday I figured the normal 1-2 hour wait would not apply to me, yet the place was not dead. ( Hmmmm, good sign in today's economy) I had to sit outside for a little while but the wait was less than 10 minutes and the woman who worked there was very nice.                                                                                                              The place is an old dive. Now don't get me wrong I love old buildings. Super fan of Coronado Cafe, Teeter house, and other old houses renovated into eating establishments but this place is not one of those. Frankly, it is pretty gross. Small and old looking with uneven floors. It only has 6 tables  or so and a tiny bar. No wonder the wait. The menu only has 6 things on the Brkfst side and 5 or so on the lunch side. I ordered a Salami Scrambled Egg plate with Rosemary potatoes.Maybe I  am not an EGGSpert so I couldn't tell what the big deal was and why they are quoted as being so much better than elsewhere. Now, they are cage free eggs and cooked in butter. They tasted good but I didn't like have a heart attack or moaning fit over them or anything. The Rosemary Potatoes were good but nothing I would wait in line hours for. I have had better. The coffee tasted average. Now, the bread was a different story YUMMERS! Smashing! I asked them if it was homemade and they said they get it at Wildflower Bakery. Soooo I am thinking to myself there are plenty of those in town. I will just go there next time. No wait or parking issues. I ordered an egg salad sandwich to go. Which was delish, BTW and the Homemade Mac salad was outstanding. So, my foodie fingers type, What's the big deal? Did I order the wrong thing? Why the fuss? What am I missing here?  It was very good I agree but Oprah and Guy Fierro????? REALLY? The service was fine. Everyone was nice.  I did go off hours so small wait. I honestly don't know how it made the Food Channel or why people wait three hours in the heat to eat here.  
   I would go back sure but if I had never heard of the place I wouldn't have ranked it even in the top 100 of my favorite dining experiences."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"Not the biggest lover of hotdogs, unless it is an Italian sausage with extra spice and or a Sabarette in NYC, I find myself contemplating why I have been wanting to go here for like, well, forever! Okay, at least as long as they opened their non food truck restaurant. It all started at the Neil Gaiman book signing. I am sure he is thrilled to be associated with this new addiction to food truck love. lol. I heard all about Short Leash from my downtown working and Food Truck Foodie friends. Then of course I have to continue to hear about it from all my Yelpie buddies. ""Afterwards, The Joy!"" They actually open a restaurant. I continue to hear all about it as if people were just rubbing it into my face on purpose. Okay, then what? They joined up with Momma Toledo's Pies too? The horror! Looks like a visit is a must. Finally, they are at the Downtown Revival and dare to not even serve any hotdogs. WHAT? What's up with that? ( In my best SNL singing voice) However, redemption is close by since they offer me and my Foodie Buddy this Fried Green Tomato dish with corn and bacon and a very mild Blue Cheese dressing. It was the most Delish, surprising,""twist treat"" of the entire night. (And I hate Blue Cheese) Okay, I am convinced. I promise to go visit their permanent location now.

I swing by today after an appointment in the neighborhood. (And to digress, how much do I adore Roosevelt Row? ) I ordered the FGTs of course, again. However, I now have a foodie dilemma. This item is listed as a salad not an App.It is a meal in itself. I was hoping it would be just a small plate App so I could get a dog too. I decide to get both anyway and split the meal as leftovers for tomorrow. I can not see any way out of it. I had to have the FGTs. I dream of those FGTs! lol. I decide to get the pretzel dog too. I am still not brave enough to get the Cracker Jack and Peanut Butter one just yet, although I hear it is ""to die"" for. Maybe next time. I tell the server that she can bring a box since I will have half now and half for lunch tomorrow. Wishful thinking. Out comes this huge monstrosity of a hot dog smothered in Sauerkraut. I start eating. About half way done I am stuffed. I then look inside the box and did not notice the waitress had already split the meal for me. How sweet of her but seriously? More food. What is on my plate was only half of the dog?YIKES! So instead of two meals I got more like four out of it all. 

Anyway, the food was great and the service even better. I had a revelation on the drive home. ( Not a surprising one) I am still not a huge hotdog fan, just saying. However, with Short Leash, who knows? It could happen. I most certainly am a new Short Leash and FGTs fan for life now. ;) If you like dogs check it out. I read they even have a Veggie option. Hmmmm, that sounds weird but I heard it is good. 

See you next time Short Leash. Maybe with a four legged patio dining companion. Did I mention I like the Fried Green tomatoes?"
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"I was involved in a side swipe accident at work on Christmas Eve that totally tore apart the side of my car. I was very upset since this was the second accident that was not my fault in two years. Crazy AZ drivers. Sigh! This is a one stop Geico shop so everything was pretty convenient with a car rental right in the lobby and the agent meeting me there. So lots of stars for convenient and I was able to get in to see them within three days of a holiday week. Probably not great if I was not already on break from my job but I was able to wait since I was off from school. 

I prayed they would not total the car since that is a big mess and I must have a car. I work two jobs and do a lot of community events for the holidays. My scheduled was double packed. The damage to my car ended up being severe and it took along time to fix my car. Luckily this time around I had renters insurance so I was able to have a rental car. I would have been in trouble if I did not, since it took over three weeks to fix the auto. 

What I noticed about this place is that Sam is very personable and took his time explaining things to me. The lady in the rental car place was a prior student of a friend so that was an awesome surprise. When I returned the car the other worker in car rental was just as wonderful. Also, ""Kudos"" to whomever the guy was that showed me how to work the keyless rental car. I had never driven one before. We had a nice chat. I am sorry that I did not get his name. 

I am giving the review four stars but I feel a 3. 5 is a better rating. I upped it because my car looks great and for the above mentioned details. I have no idea how they did it but it seems okay. So far so good. However, with that said, I feel there are some things they could work on. 

The communication was not very good and could have been better. I do see that part of this might have been my agents fault. However, with that said, I was promised a call back on two occasions and that did not happen. I am a person of my word so that bothered me a bit. It is better to say something like I will try to call you on Wednesday with an update  rather then promising a call tomorrow and not following through. 

Normally, I am easy going on that but I needed to rearrange shifts and charity events in order to make time to pick up my car. A lot of people were inconvenienced that week because they kept changing the fix date. 
Like I said, this might have been more my insurance companies fault, but still. 

Another thing I noted was that when I had called several times the person who answered the phone was cold and rude. The first time I came in same story. However, on my return the front line staff were very nice. I wonder if they let the other person go? Not good for a first impression for any business. It is crucial for your desk workers to be polite and warm. Car accidents are very upsetting to people no matter the circumstances. 

I do have to say my car looks like new and so far it is running great. I pray that I will never need these people's services ever again but if you do let me know how it goes."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"I must be the only person in Phx never to eat here. Ok, so we did finally go before Phantom. Mixed reviews here.I love Peiwei so assumed I would love this place too.I did not.  I am at a crossroad as to give it a good review or a bad so I  will just say what happened noting what I liked an disliked about the experience.  We got here at around 4:45 which was good because by the time we left the place had a long wait and was packed. The first thing I did not like is the way it is set up. Tables all over the place with no spaces to walk in between. It was very odd. I found this very annoying and I am sure a nightmare for older or handicapped people. It seemed very weird for me to be banging into people's elbows as I walked by their tables. The service was very good at the start but died when they got busy. Although the manager here was great, printing out nutritional value menu for me and another waitress walked me to the bathroom. Our server was ok, seemed a little ditzy but was ok, not great just, OK. I ordered a wedge salad with chicken and got a wedge salad with no chicken. I ate it all before I realized it. (I know don't ask. I guess I was starving and the blood drained from my brain) I did not want the waitress to think I was trying to scam her. I pointed it out and said it was Ok since I did not point it out sooner and after all I did eat it all but just an FYI for the cook. She did not seem very concerned and I think this is a huge mistake for a place to make. They did not comp the bill the difference which I think they should have even though I said it was ok.( The salad was good but there was a three dollar difference in price) I worked in the restaurant business for years and comping the difference would  have been the very  least I would have done. I also thought that was a huge mistake on the part of the cook and server in an expensive place such as this. . Of course, I do take partial responsibility for not noticing it until it was to late and the food was good. The dressings make it. I had these awesome cucumbers too that tasted nice.  Again, it is their sauce. My friend had a noodle dish that was very tasty too. The service took along time to get the food to us though and the place was horribly noisy. Yikes! Two large parties sandwiched around us. One where children kept clinking knives on the glasses non stop and the other table had people clapping every minute about something or another. This was horrid! I like a quieter dining experience please.The last straw was when a couple with 2 very naughty kids sat down in back of us and I got wacked in the back of the head with the kid's paper that he kept flinging around and hitting his father with.A father that did not do one thing to discipline the kid.  Please if you are bringing out the kids leave if they are misbehaving. All in all the experience was not horrible but not great either. I might go back for lunch and try some more of their dishes. However, to be honest there are other good restaurants in town that are better suited to me. Since I love Peiwei i will eat there more often and skip this much pricier option."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"One of the things that frustrates me when I want a night out is that the movie I want to see is never playing at the right time to eat dinner out too. You either have to eat dinner way too early to finish in time and make the show or eat after the show but by then it is midnight. lol 
   So how to solve the issue, go to a dine in theater. I am mad I did not think of this idea myself. Haha! I had heard a lot about this concept this year but had not had the chance to go to one yet. I finally indulged this past Saturday. I had not been to this location since they remodeled so did not know what to expect except the things I had heard, which were all wonderful.
   The concept is a bit different from a regular movie. You purchase your seats with a certain seat number ahead of time, kind of like a play or concert. You can choose between the Dine In Theater or the Lounge. The lounge is three dollars extra and has reclining seats. They advertise the lounge as having "" A more adult like feel! ""  Ok, don't ask me what that means-hahaha! but My friends say it is great. 
   When I first walked in I noticed the nice lobby lounge chairs and bar. You can order drinks and food outside like in the old days-;0) that's ok too but the great thing here is that your theater chair is actually like a table at a restaurant. No more long lines at the popcorn counter, wow! (People who are late a lot will love it here! Ya hear that certain friends of mine?-lol- You all can run to your seat, get food delivered, and Wah-La the movie starts. brawhahah- sorry I digress) They give you full service right at your seat and even extend it during the movie. There is a button to call the waitress over when you need something but to be honest I never needed to punch the buttons. The servers were all over us the minute we sat down and the minute we needed anything. Actually, the service here was outstanding which prompted me to write a review! I thought it would be a bit distracting but it really was not.
   The food was OK not bad but not OMG I am going to die either. The menu was a lot more innovative then I thought it would be so I would go back to try some other things.I just ordered the bread and pretzel basket with red sauce and spicy cheese dip. It was good but how do you go wrong with that? My friend had a burger that she said was good. The Parm fries were tasty.  The thing I liked best is getting refills given to me at my seat. Yahoooo! The simplest things are the smallest blessings. 
  OK, have to write the negative. You pay for the convenience. The place is very expensive so bring your wallet. The cheapest movie is 12 bucks and the lounge is 15 and the food is over priced. Wow! Shocking you say. Food overpriced at the movies? I am so surprised! But in this case it is really over priced. Well, like I said before you pay for the convenience, I suppose. Sadly, I won't be able to go here all the time but a nice treat every now and again. I suppose when you factor in gas and travel time between a restaurant and a movie house it might be similar.  Check it out. Definitely worth at least a one time visit to see what you think."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"Great, great, great service. Again, two more dogs were dumped at my school. I helped them find homes. Part of the whole adoption and rescue included a visit here. I wish I knew about it for my cats. It is very cheap compared to the plan I got with Petsmart. It is a five star service for sure. They do great things and even have a Feral cat program. God Bless them. Please, someone help them to open more clinics. 

As much as I hate to do this since Az is just awful as far as animal welfare goes, I am knocking off a star. I am doing this as a heads up to folks who want to use the service because of a very rude staff member and a very disorganized check in procedure. Just be flexible if you chose their services. Perhaps bring another person to help you? 

The place has an assembly line check in so do not expect fancy Vet customer service. You get what you pay for. In my case I was not paying. I was just helping out and dropping off the dogs. I kept telling the woman at intake this and she kept arguing with me. This proved to be very stressful for me and the dogs. I left the place extremely upset. The dogs were very scared. They had been through a lot these last two weeks. 

I was especially annoyed at the way one of the intake clerks was treating me. She was snappy and rude with me. I noticed she treated a few other patrons the same way. I think the check in process is stressful, disorganized, and unclear. Maybe a sign to tell you how to do it? I had no idea what to do. When I returned the paperwork on the counter the woman literally tore my head off, threw it back at me and said, ""get back in line."" I was so confused. Usually one hands in paperwork at a medical clinic and then gets called back up in turn. Also, there really was not a line to get back into. Maybe they should do a ticket number thing like at the Deli? 

The intake room is way too small for the volume. Lots of pets peeing, smelly, and loud barking craziness. There was nowhere to sit. I had to fill out the paperwork standing up with two dogs tugging on a leash, jumping on my legs, and hiding behind me twisting the leash around me, scared to death. The intake worker kept telling me to move away from the counter but there was nowhere else to go. Those dog's butts were not budging from their hiding area. Poor babies were very stressed out, so was I. 

A few patrons were yelling at the intake workers for not having them down for their verified appointments too. I wanted to video tape the scene it was sooooooooooo crazy.  It sure was a zoo both literally and figuratively. lol. When you have scared animals it can be very aggravating. The intake worker could have been much nicer. 

However, all of the other staff members were very helpful, especially the Techs. I also liked the woman who was walking around helping people. Karma dictated that she appeared after I already checked in and was on my way out. 

Anyway, it is a great service for sure just be open minded. Be prepared to be a bit aggravated for your reduced cost services. I could have given them 5 stars but they need to improve their check in services. They also should educate staff surrounding sensitivity."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"So there is only one thing that stops me from being a Vegan- Wait for it, Yelp, you guessed it- hamburgers. Ok, maybe not just one thing but burgers are certainly high up there on the list. Love me a good burger. Sorry cows. Yes I do love animals but my willpower fails me when it comes to a great juicy meat patty. But I digress. In regards to INOB Frankly, everyone raves about this place and I never got it. There are so many better hamburgers in town.  All the times I went here did not leave a memorable impression in my brain, good or bad. sooooooooo, when I saw they opened one more centrally located I decided to go again with the soul purpose of writing a review. (Hmmmm that's a switch for foodie Mary here who usually only goes to eat first and write second) 
   INOB is known for using real meat and not processed patty garbage- so give them a check on the positive. ( And they might be one of the few fast food restaurants that uses real food) In N Out is know for their wonderful hiring procedures and employee and employer relations.
(gotta love that in today's day and age) - another check- INOB burgers cost under 5 bucks and a little bit over for a combo- WOWZA checkmate! (Mary does not like paying 10- 15 dollars for a good hamburger. She will, haha, but doesn't like to) 
   Ok, so now onto the negative-( Sigh, I know but I have to share)  Crazy busy places make me nervous and messes up the shopping center parking lot when I need to got to Michael's- check minus for almost getting hit five times getting there today.  French Fries-ewhhhhh! Why were they cold if they serve them fresh? I know I am very picky about temperature and fries.I don't eat fries to much anymore so I want them to be really good when I indulge because I hate to throw them out and waste food and money. They just aren't that good here- check minus. 
   And now onto the golden reason I liked today's visit the best----- It was the customer service!( big roar in the background inserted here)  Jeepers Kreepers INOB staff members can ya keep the smileage down please? Do you have to be so nice? LOL! I swear they send the staff to happy, friendly, excellent customer service college. They are all very nice and give service with a smile. Eye contact and everything. (Makes the longer wait a little but more manageable)  It is amazing how they beat out the others by a mile in this dept. Even better than some fancy restaurants. 
   So in conclusion, is INOB the best burger in town- no far from it. Is it good- yes. Is it the best burger for fast food under 15 bucks -HMMMMMMM, well you decide. I'll never tell. But to tell you my secret It is in my two top favorites. You will have to guess which one I like more. I do admit my favorite though comes nowhere close in the Customer Service dept and the Phoenix locations can't match the back east versions. So with that said many of my Westerner Peeps might end up picking INOB as their first choice. So, enjoy and be happy there is finally one more centrally located. And from the line out the door I think it is about time.  
PS- you might want to tell them to hold the onions though. Wehhhh 6 hours later and my breath is still reliving the experience."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"They asked 100 Yelp elites to be judges. I am not sure what the other reviewer meant by no one called them back since none of us experienced that. My guess is they were not chosen to participate. None of us had any issues in that regards. As it turned out this event was not what we expected at all. We heard tons of complaints from actual guests who paid for tickets. I think they need to have a contract with the vendors, better vendors, or at the very least better communication. 

We expected samples from all the contestants and to sit in a place and eat them then vote. Instead, we were asked to get samples then walk all the way back to a camera and eat and talk to the camera there. The problems were plentiful. We were not given a tray to carry things, most of us were starving and did not wait, the camera was not there after walking back several times to be interviewed, and we could not get food. Most vendors refused us food. Several Elites left early because they could not get food nor participate fairly in the ballot judging. 

Instead we received 10 food tickets (50 places were in the challenge or so the ballot said. How is that fair?) and one drink ticket. It took over an hour to get those tickets to us. They should have had everything ready ahead of time for us. Maybe in a folder, with a tray, pencil and with a short cut in line pass. We got dirty looks for sure. After explaining we were with the sponsors and that we were entitled to short cut as judges most folks were super cool. However, we stopped short cutting after the second booth we felt so bad.

What was strange is that we were refused at most places.They said they were not doing samples nor coupons. I know that is what most guests paid for. That seems like false advertising to me. We were also treated rudely at some booths. One actually claimed she did not even know who Yelp was. Ummmmm, they sponsored the event, What? Maybe the vendors should sign a contract with the coordinating company.

They ran out of water and soda three times before three PM and the event was suppose to run until 8pm. By two pm they ran out of specialty liquor in the beer garden. They said the water and soda delivery vendor was very bad /slow but who knows what the real reason was. Tons of vendors ran out of food by 2pm. I think the entire event was just really messed up. They got way more people then they expected ( 3,000 Friday night with an expected 600)  and the vendors were very ill informed of the expectations. It was the first time in a new city so issues happen. I hope next year goes better. Ask us for help. 

What we had was good for the most part but nothing to write home about. The Pannini, Sorbetta, Chitown popcorn, and Taco Toppings truck were the best we tried. I still gave the festival three stars because we had fun. I love my Yelp friends. We always laugh together and manage to have a great time. I also did like several of the vendors we chatted up. They were nice and made up for the rude folks. The music and beer garden were too small but still cool. Three stars for being free but not so much if you paid to go. I might have to take a star off for the bad sunburn I got on my neck. Only in Arizona can one say that in November."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"This was not a good experience. The only reason I am giving it two stars is for two reasons. One is for the delightful folks we met at the restaurant in order to not get kicked off of our table for 6. ( Yes, kicked off a table- Sheesh!) They were awesome folks though. Two, the woman who took our order was very nice. 

The restaurant is built with no rhyme, reason or sense. If it was not crowded enough they crowded even more tables into an already cramped space. They put the coffee counter in the worse strategically placed area in the entire restaurant. I got knocked over twice when I tried to refill my coffee. The restaurant itself is cut throat to get a seat and packed with angry, rude customers and staff who ask you if you are done yet. (Really? When I go out I do not want people rushing me and making me rush off my table. How rude) When we finally got a table we literally got told me could not sit there and had to move because it was reserved for 6 or more people. WHAT??? I have never seen this in a restaurant before. The waitress kept telling us we had to move. Finally, I was so pissed after she told us to go outside in 120 degree heat we went and got people who were waiting and invited them to sit down with us. We made a party table. The waitress was not happy with us. Oh well, the feeling was mutual.
The staff find it impossible to work here. They can not deliver the food or service the self serve coffee counter due to space limitations and crowds of people waiting to fight it out for a table. I had the sad misfortune to time my empty coffee cup with the staff members attempt to deliver a new urn of coffee. With that and other customers visiting the counter for napkins and such, it makes it a literally impossible and maddening task. The waitress trying to replace the urn was very rude and snappy with me. She about ripped my head off. Sorry, I am in your way lady. I am a paying customer actually trying to get some of your coffee. They really need to change the entire layout of how they do things here. I can't believe no one has ever gotten hurt or burnt eating at Ncounter. To make matters worse there is a table like two inches away from the counter. God forbid one sits at that table. 

So, ""what about the food?"" Hmmmmmm, I found the food not good at all. The coffee was not exceptionally yummy and was way too hot. I got the Banana's Foster and it was Blahhhh. It tasted weird and made me feel sick afterwards. It had some weird sauce on top of it that did not taste right and was strange to the touch. Also, part of our order was not delivered and we had to drive back to get it. My meal was also not hot enough. 

On the fair side, my friend had the ham sandwich dish that has a french name to it. I tasted it and it was okay but not good enough for the price. The brownie cookie we had was good too. It wasn't the best I have ever had but good. Their other bakery items looked promising, except maybe the bagel, which looked gross. 

The entire experience was so aggravating I would not go back unless it was winter for patio seating, and or off hours, ( But what are their off hours here? This is the second time I have been here and it was too crowded to get service) It seems taking things Togo here might be the way to go. However, then they would need to change the name of the restaurant wouldn't they?"
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"My review is for the 16th St and Camelback  store . I could not seem to find a link so I am writing one here. With todays economy I am surprised Nationwide does not go out of its way to have better customer service. I won't be going back and I have been a customer for over 4 years. Now I find that sad since I love the Dr. at this location. ( Or at least the one they had) Last year I went there and bought  a years supply of contacts, which I do every year because I have great insurance and the promised manufacturers rebate.( Which I have been promised but have not received the last two years. This past year it was because I  was not a Canadian resident.HELLO????? This is your first warning about Nationwide. They say the manufacturer has a rebate and many people never get them even though they have sent in all
the correct info. I found 100s of blogs online about this)  In July I found that one of the 6 pack boxes of my lenses were dysfunctional and another box was empty.( I was in Florida on vacation. Thank God I had another box with me!) But because they are monthly lenses that left me two months short of a year.  When I tried to get Nationwide to give me some replacement  they gave me only one causing me to have a shortfall for three- five weeks with no working lenses. ( Parent -Teacher conferences this week are pretty fun because I can not read data sheets or see my computer screen since I am using two year old lenses right now. Also, I am sure there are a ton of spelling and grammar mistakes in this review. Sorry about that. I am blind as a bat right now and for the next 2 weeks-LOL) I called Nationwide about the issue as soon as I got  back into town and they said it was a manufactures problem that happen every now and gain. I reminded them that they sold me the lenses and asked if they were Ok knowing they were selling lenses at 120 dollar a six pack that were either empty boxes or defaults. I also complained about the apparent lack of rebates they are promising. The women than got very testy with me and said, ""take it up with them. It is not our problem?( After making it out like I was lying and talking to me like I was a 6 year old. I hate that. That is one sure way to get my gander up. )  When I called back to make an appt I was not told until a week later and the day before my exam that I could not come in the next day because my years insurance did not kick in until two weeks later from that day.( Really, the day before? I made the appt over a week ahead of time and they waited until 4pm the day before to call me???) She then said, ""Well you can come in as a cash pay customer."" OMG what an idiotic thing to say. I could pay way over 800 dollars or more when I only have to pay 60 with my insurance. And she said it in a very demeaning way.  I asked for another pair of lenses to hold me over and was flat out refused saying it was to long after I bought them. So Nationwide, I have a question for you. Since you are endorsing purchasing a years supply of lenses with a non existent rebate offer and then not making good on dysfunctional ones isn't that kind of , dishonorable,  illegal, and immoral business behavior? Am I suppose to open every contact lense box, try on the lenses, and check them beforehand? And then how do I repack them so they stay wet for a year? HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!! Sorry I am taking my business elsewhere. Beware folks, beware! I think they should be reported to the county attornies office. And the last review about the dirt. YIKES! That is extremely frightening in Swine flue society. And heaven forbid folks we are talking about a persons eyes!!!!! Shame on them!"
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"*5 plus stars if you are open minded, do not embarrass easy and want to have some hearty good laughs. This is a definite ""Stays in Vegas"" experience. 

Spoiler alert to follow***************Please do not read unless you know about this place or like to be surprised. 

*No stars if you are easily offended or have kids- do not go 

*Two and a half stars for the food. lol-- I don't think folks go here for the food. We do not remember what the food tasted like. 
Brawhaha

*Drinks look good. We did not have any so no opinion on that but I hear they are awesome and have great specials. 

I averaged it out to a 4 star review because it was highly entertaining after we got used to it of course. ;) 


  We had no idea when we came in why all the servers kept walking past us and refusing to sit us. They continued to ignore us. Then someone came by, looked at us ignored us and then sat the folks last in line. Even they were aghast and murmured a quick, ""sorry"" to us. We asked to be given a table adding, ""We have been here a while."" The guy threw the menus at us and said, ""Oh ya have have ya? Give me a break. Sit yourselves."" We were like, "" WTH?""  We were appalled but somehow I recognized something in a fellow actor. Maybe, it was the twinkle in his eye. So before I strangled him and demanded to see his manager, I poked my head into the restaurant to see what was up. Rude caveman sighs, loudly I might add, and begrudgingly walks us to our table. He asked if we had ever heard of the place or been in. When we said, ""no"" this is when all hell broke loose.  The ""stupid"" word was used, He yelled as he walked us to our table "" Coming through with some Moronic Newbies.""  napkins were thrown at us, food passed by with phallic symbols on it, eye rolls of impatience and sympathy from the fellow staffers, etc and so forth. We sat there for about 2 minutes with our jaws on the table before we finally got the fact it was suppose to be this way. Then we rolled on the floor laughing. Of course this just gets the waiter even more annoyed with how silly and dumb we were. lol--- Thank God I am not a prude or embarrassed easily. To be honest I was embarrassed anyway. My friend starts to really get into it and I have to remind her she is a wife, mother, and grandmother so sit the heck down and behave. This is when we noticed the equally offensive slogans, posters hanging around on the walls, the waiter made hats on the fellow customers, and songs being sung for birthday patrons. ""My Dearie Goody Two Shoes Ears!"" YIKESAROONI!

So as you have gathered by now it is a themed restaurant where they purposely treat you nasty/saracastic/rude/raunchy etc. It gets dirty though so please do not bring kids here. There were tons here when we were there and that really bothered me since there is no warning sign out front. Also,do not go if you are offended by that sort of thing.

What was really fun was whenever a new person comes in. People sit here all day to watch their confused faces, like ours, before they get the joke. It is like the customers are the audience and you are the new actors on stage. When the group of four 80 plus year old's came in and sat next to us we could not control our laughter over their confused and outraged faces. My friend and I were laughing so hard that helped them catch on and finally figured it out. It is an interesting human psychology experiment to watch. Human nature at it's best. Go Gramps and Grams because they were getting into it too! After eating We never wanted to leave the place. We were having so much fun.

Oh to review the food, what food? Don't ask us about the food. We honestly have no idea because we do not remember. We do remember the food and restaurant is beach themed if that helps.

We finally got up to leave after an hour and the manager says, So how was everything?"" Before we could answer he says, ""Well it had better have been good. You took long enough. Your friend there was all over my man server. Now get the hell out of my place."" Brawhahahahahahahahahahah!!!!!! We'll be back next week. JK or are we?"
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"A long review but I wanted to take minute to write a review about my experience and the great service I received. I guess I just went with the company my carrier suggested not really knowing anything about windshield replacements. So this review is more on service than expertise. I will let you know if my windshield falls out later? Ha!

So the good thing is this company will come to your work and will change the windshield right there in the parking lot. I work at a school, so okay, kind of weird but nice and convenient for busy me.This in itself is a great deal since I am a teacher who works a second job on the weekends. I am just too busy to deal with these car issues and cannot be without a car. I give them points for that alone. 

So it was a rough experience to start. At first, I had no issues with the scheduling they were great, helpful, no hold time. They came within the time they said but towards the end of the day. When they came though they did not replace the windshield. The message they gave our secretary did not make sense to me so as I walked back to my classroom to call them back I was annoyed and upset to say the least. However, I was greeted with an almost,""I am reading your mind so called you twice and texted you already message."" from a manager calling to reschedule and explain what happened.( So I started the review with 5 stars due to this great Customer Service immediate reach out) I was very impressed with this. The man sounded generally concerned that I would be upset and that he could not talk to me right away. The issue is that my phone is off when I teach.

So the gentleman, whose name I forgot, tells me that they do not come out at first to replace the windshield with certain carriers they are asked to see if it can be patched up first. Thanks insurance company for neglecting to tell me that part of the deal. I could have told you that crack was too long to fix. So I guess the first visit is a check to see if they can fix it and then the the second is to replace if they can not fix it. Now it makes sense to me. This is totally not the companies fault but my carriers fault for lack of good communication skills. Someone should have told me this somewhere along the line so I was annoyed to no end. 

The way the manager handled this was beyond wonderful customer service and saved the day. Talk about turning a bad situation around with empathy. He was beyond helpful. He explained thoroughly what had happened in a clear and concise matter and told me he wanted to make it right any way he could. Well by then I understood and was not annoyed at all. I just wanted it fixed. But this man was just on a role to make me feel very good about his company. How dare he. I mean come on! He was saying all kinds of nice and warm fuzzy things like, ""I am so sorry!""  ""You are my customer."" ""You are a priority."" ""I want to make sure I work around your schedule and want to make it right."" Talk about crazy talk right? Winky face inferred.

So when they rescheduled they were an hour early on show up day (Thank God I was at school) telling me I was their first priority that day. The workers they sent were told they should wait for me even if I was not there yet. (Waaa????) They wanted me to be the first customer of the day. They wanted to get the job done before school started to make sure I was happy and be able to contact me and make sure it all went well. 

Needless to say I am a fan of thsi company! They got it done for sure. The men that showed up were beyond nice too. I give them points for not running away screaming from my totally messy, campaign sign filled, teacher dirty, cluttered car. They did the job fast and well. I even got a follow up text and email asking how it went. Okay, stop annoying me now. Again, Winky Emoji inferred.

So I am giving the company four stars for the way they handled it. I took off a star because the manger told me their workers could make cash change but the workers told me they never carry cash. I purchased a service upgrade while they were there so needed to prepay for it. That is a big miscommunication error that could have lead to an issue. Good thing I had a lot of scattered change at the bottom of my purse though. 

Thanks Safelight for making me feel like a valued customer."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"Ughhhhhhh, I hate to do it since the show was so amazing but this place is a mess!!!!! I have a hard time knowing how many stars to give to this facility. I gave it one due to averaging a few good things and the rest being such horrible negatives. They need to hire a spot on marketing person who can fix this place up to the glory it once was. I get that it is old. I also would say it gets 4 stars on a few aspects. Every seat in the house is good due to the revolving stage and view. Except that is not true for the video. We could not see it at all from our seats. For this show, that mattered since it was a charity show that had several presentations on the video screen. Another good thing is the cool retro lounge in the basement by the extra bathrooms. Cool wall art down there. Also, the staff members were all very nice, although severely lacking in numbers. 

However, with the positive said, last night had to be the worse concert experience I have ever had. I get that there are some things you can not change like totally rude people who must have never had any social experiences before in their entire life and talk all the way through a narrated presentation. ( did they not attend kindergarten and learn manners?) I get that you can not rebuild an old stadium and actually rebuild the seats to make a chair that can fit a petite 5'3 person, forget about an average sized person. However, you should not have to climb over a wall and turn your body sideways and then actually get stuck on a holiday wreath to get in your row. That might or might not have happened last night, just saying. ( If you go, never book rows 24-26). Maybe not serve drinks in cups that do not fit in the holders on the side of the squashed seats that are actually in the lap of the person next to you who is sitting like the pillsbury dough boy stuffed in so tight. I mean it is really not cool to get a spilled drink in my lap for just sitting in my seat. That might be a tad helpful too. 

Add to the fact I went home with bruises on my backside due to the rude person in back of me who was constantly kicking my seat and hurting me. I had a hard time working the next day due to back pain. ( Again a reminder do not book row 24 or up in this facility if you ever go) and forget; the parking lot attendant who sent people to a totally full lot and that I had to jump out of the car before my friend parked due to the lanes being so narrow even with her small car. Add to that fact, the security line had only one person scanning and one person bag checking. Add to that fact, ( do all these facts add up to something I wonder?) they took my good teacher pen way. Really? A pen? And I work at the stadium which has the best security in the NFL and they let me keep my darn teacher pen. Adding all this together does lead to something as in, ""an awful experience."" It makes paying mortgage prices for a ticket totally not even in the realm of being worth it at all to see a live show. 

To add to the mess, the two hour line in the woman's bathroom and running out of brochures before half the patrons even got there, just made this an awful and uncomfortable exhausting concert experience even before you get to your seat and the show started. Forget having to get up and use the restroom after the show started. It was a whole big production with lives almost lost. 


There are some things they can do to help to make it better. Hire a PR firm then go hire triple the amount of staff. One person scanning tickets and one bar tender just seems like a disaster waiting to happen and horrendous planning on the companies part. Train your parking lot attendants better. Add bathrooms somehow. If Gammage can do it so can you. God forbid ask rude people to leave. Also, give an option on things you take away for people on how they can get it back. It is not our fault security is being ridiculous and over the top these days. I appreciate that you want to keep me safe but if you take things away you should allow the person an option on returning it. I still can't get past taking away a pen. Sigh!

If I ever go back, which is doubtful, I would pay more to be in the lounge or first row, and get an aisle seat. However at ticket prices ranging in hundreds of dollars I doubt it. I have more important things to spend my money on."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"What a crazy experience this has been opening a restaurant in Phoenix. So of course I read all the hype and stories over the past year and a half and in regards to last week's grand opening. I was going to wait a while before visiting because let's be honest, everyone who knows me knows how picky I am about good pizza and only the NY style. Besides, who lines up at 11am for a 4pm restaurant opening? Well, I guess Malnati's fans do. Even the staff thought they were nuts-lol! I am not even that much of a Foodie. 

So, I happened to find myself in the same shopping center today, coincidence? I think not! I walked over to investigate the hype and to get a menu. ( I could not find one online) Well, I got there at about 3:15 knowing they do not open until 4pm. I took a peek inside. A young lady walked right out and started talking to me. She handed me a menu and told me that they open at 3:30pm. They really do not open until 4pm. However, if they are ready they have been opening up earlier to let people in due to crowds. That seemed impressive to me so I hung around and waited. They opened at about 3:50. I was first on line. I am kind of proud of that. I am not competitive much, am I? While on line I had a lovely chat with a family friend of the owners who flew out to help and check things out. Also, the staff comes out and offers bottles of water to those waiting online. This place seems more like destination dining but more on service later. 

I was sat quickly after walking in. (Ha, I was first) This place must run on the original 5 second rule because before my behind even hit the seat my server Dave was at my table. Maybe, to make up for the wait outside? He went through his little spiel and we chatted. I could not remember if I had their pizza before on my varied trips to Chi-Town. I believe I might have tried it at Taste of Chicago but could not remember. Dave took my order and was pretty great, and so hilarious to boot. I liked Dave. He is very flexible. He knows the art of compromise! He will make a good husband some day to a lucky young suitor. I say this because after a little back and forth throw down on whose pizza is better, he took the fifth and agreed the customer is always right. ( Maybe he didn't really believe it to be so but I am okay with that) We finally agreed that when I am in Chicago I will eat pizza with a fork and when he is in NY he will eat pizza folded over with his hands. lol. Gotta love Dave! In fact, I have to say the service here was amazing. You are fawned over. For such a busy place they got it down. I like team concept restaurants that share the service. None of that, ""This is not my table."" baloney.

Okay, so onto the food. It seems my Peeps are divided over this place and their pizza so I was fairly warned. The pizza is different. I was wholly prepared to think of them as two different beast and I agree they are. If I see it this way then I found the food to be very good. ( except i did not care for the lemon garlic salad dressing for some reason) This type of pizza is not the same as NY style pizza. The crust is called ""butter crust"" and it tastes more like a bakery item. Maybe more like a good bakery bread or even cake. The pizza has more sauce on it and less spices and is baked together with the cheese so is a bit blander than the NY style, oily, spicy stuff I love. It seems like it is more like a casserole or pie/Calzone then a slice. I like my pizza with more spices on it. However, I admit I really liked theirs too for what it was. The butter crust is so very good. I could eat just that. I am not saying I did and I am not saying I didn't, okay? However, there might be video of me picking at my pizza and just eating the crust. Okay, who am I? I have come a long way from the Long Island girl who used to hide her crust under her napkin as a kid. Ha!

So great place. The line was out the door when I left and people were vying for my up close parking spot. I think my 1 hour door to exit dining experience was not typical right now so if you are inpatient you might want to wait a bit before you go. Lunch service is suppose to start in June but the menu says it is express pizza. That must mean their pies are Pre-Made. One takes 35 minutes to make. I might drop by for lunch for other menu options when it quiet downs a bit. 

So Zonies and Chi-Town transplants, enjoy but sorry Dave, I still like NY pizza better. Maybe return dining is needed for more taste testing?  ( Insert winky, smiley emoji) Happy eating all. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention all their servings are made for two- four people even their desserts. Single servings are even too large for one person so plan accordingly, or for leftovers at least."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"I spent one day in Vegas this weekend and it had to be the most eventful one day road trip ever. Maybe the whole Hangover movie was putting out energy vibes my way or something. Anyway, here is my lighthearted and long winded review of the Casino/hotel that I stayed in. It is Tongue and Cheek of course but I wondered about it before I booked it so I am being thorough for my Yelpers. 

To stay in Henderson or the Strip??? Well, it depends on your goal in Vegas. Ask yourself, ""Why am I in Vegas?"" Then of course keep it to yourself because of you know, the whole ""unwritten"" rule thing.-lol-- If you just want a place to sleep and have a car this is the best deal in town. It really is and I am not kidding. 49 bucks for a Sunday night stay in a full casino type of resort. (No crazy extra resort fees either) I think the next night was like 18 dollars a night. Jezhhhhh! I looked all over for a hotel/motel that was cheaper and came up with ""Nada."" In fact most were double the price. I only needed one night to lay my head down before the long ride back home. I did notice though that their Saturday rate was 79 dollars. All other places were way over $150 for that date. 

I was all set to book another place for my one night. This place will remain nameless. Let's just call it the Norman Bates Inn. You know, it is one of those seedy motels hookers go to, in a very dubious part of Downtown/Strip. Let's also just say, it is an open style courtyard motel where all the doors open to the Morgue, Errrr,  Ummmmm, I mean parking lot, Ummmmmm, I mean street with no security, no services type of motel. You know the ones where they find dead bodies and all? And to boot, The Bates Inn even cost more. Now I am pretty brave at times, but why risk it? And why in the world would I pay more to view the oldest professions in town? 

So, this was a great deal because it kept me alive being an enclosed casino and all, (Just kidding, or am I?) has a small, full service, not very busy gaming area, (nothing fancy schmanzy which works out great for me) a few restaurants, two bars, and even a Players Club. ( I got a free room to come back just for signing up. WOW!) I wonder if the Bates Inn has a Bar? Sorry, I digressed there for a minute and not sure I want to even ponder that thought too much. So in the end this was a ""steal"" for just needing a bed and saving 30 minutes on the car ride home. The staff members were all either nice, disinterested, or spectacular. More of them were on the wonderful side. The head of housekeeping is a ""Hoot"" and The servers in the Cafe were really, really, nice. I see other Yelpers mentioned that too. It is a well deserved comment because they really were like the nicest ladies I have ever met in an eating establishment. The food is not all that great but it is passable and they will try to make it right. 

Please note, yes the rooms are very run down. This casino is very old. Historic. Check your key and paper to know what room you are really in despite what they tell you at the front desk. Now that's my first little secret Vegas story, wink, wink. The beds were pretty comfortable. I am not sure why another Yelper said no Alarm Clock. My room had a clock, lamps, beds, table, chair, wall unit ac that worked too freezing well, towels, iron, ironing board. Gosh Darn It, my room even had a TV too, not that I used it. The shower does have issues though. The shower is very old and is very hard to work. I got a great workout turning it on and off. I did notice some rust, or darker stains on the walls. I don't think it was mold but ya never know. (Just aged.) I personally did not care since it was clean. I was not in the room to spa it up or be fancy. I knew this was an old place before I got there and you should too. My room was just fine for the price.  Actually for the price I thought the room was even great. Go to the Strip if you want luxury. 

If you plan on drinking or hanging on the Strip this hotel is NOT for you. It is too far away at 20 miles or a 35 minute drive. No drinking and driving please. I don't care about the whole ""unspoken rule"" thing when it comes to a DUI right? I helped someone who got hurt at the Smith Center because he was drinking, walking, and trying to drive. When I finally arrived back at this hotel after numerous witness statements I was drenched in blood. True story number two! And here I thought the whole blood thing would happen over at Bates.  

So, in a nutshell if you just need a room to crash or don't mind driving to your fun like a local, then stay here. 

Pros- Price, safety, location, Railroad/Vegas history memorabilia, The bar has a great window view, And yes, a train comes by outside, small casino if you do not gamble 
Cons- Location for Strip fun, run down/older facility if you want fancy, small Casino if you gamble

Choo, Choo, Bye, Bye!"
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"The low reviews on here totally shock me. This restaurant is fantastic! To each his own. My guess is some folks might not know food or understand the restaurant's concept. If you are looking for traditional Southern food this might not work for you since it is a fusion, modern type of fare. 

Let's start with the decor. Very low key, rustic type of warehouse. It was not part of the original structure, as others incorrectly mentioned, but an add on. I asked and was told it was constructed new not redesigned. The feel of the original building, which is now Changing Hands Bookstore and First Draft Bar, were taken into account. The restaurant has very pretty chandeliers and low key ceiling art. My guess is they were trying to replicate a rail dining cart with big windows, lots of light, and that huge clock on the wall that reminds me of a rail station clock. The bar is to the east and the tables are all just lined up to the west. Very simple elegance and grace. The only thing I noticed missing, and even suggested, is that they need an ""architectual"" type of pineapple sign or wall hanging at the door since they did not incorporate one into any of the wall designs. This is steeped in southern tradition as a welcome.

Now on to the ""loud"" comments. I never even noticed the ""Too Loud"" thing and I am very sensitive to loud noises. After reading the reviews we did notice it was loud. However, we loved it. We enjoyed seeing the joy and celebration on the other patron's faces. The community table was having a blast! We felt that It was not shockingly loud but yes I suppose it is a fun place being part of a bar and all. If we wanted quiet we would go somewhere else. I would never have noticed if my friend did not want to know what the reviewers were saying while we ate. She made me look it up. lol.  I would never dream of taking stars off of a restaurant for something like that since it is the theme of the place. I would just note it as a tip or a comment in the review. At no time could I not hear my friend or servers so it could not have been that loud and the place was packed. ( We got there early and reservations at the ""Rail"" are suggested) 

Of course one wants to know about the food. It's totally fantastic. With one of the top noted chef's in AZ how could it not be. Now it is different so be forewarned.  Open you mind to the notion. I know a challenge for most Arizonians. lol. I got the Meatloaf Special. It came with these bread pudding sticks. My guess is these are the chef's version of Southern Hush Puppies. I asked the waitress but she did not know what Hush Puppies were. That kind of shocked me. lol --Even Ms. Nyer here knows what a Hush Puppy is. Two stars off for that. (Insert sarcasm marks here)  These Bread pudding Hush Puppies, which I will call BPHP from now on, were divine! Also, my Meatloaf was out of this world. My friend had the Chicken and Dumplings. She was expecting chicken and dumplings on a plate and not the broth based type of dish she got. She could not stop raving about it. I tried it. Okay, twice but ""Shhhhhhh"" don't tell. It was mouth watering. The Dumplings were so crazy good. Since it was my birthday we had to have desert. My friend got the Bread Pudding and I got the Beignets. We shared. We thought we would take home  leftovers. Nope. The Bread Pudding here is sinful and the donuts are huge. Actually, one of the donuts made it home for next day breakfast but the Bread Pudding was a goner. I have to say Piggy noises could be heard while the pudding was being inhaled. Okay, Pigs are southern, right? ;) I could come here every day just for the dessert. I heard the Coconut cake here is to die for too and I love Coconut cake. 

Some people mentioned that service needs to be fine tuned. Well, they must have fixed that up real quick because our service was great. Despite being very busy and a popular place the service was wonderful. I was even walked to the bathroom by a manager. Many folks were walking the floor and stopped by to greet us. Our server was delightful, well in all ways except for the not knowing what a Hush Puppy was. Okay, I have to let that go.  I am kidding of course, for those who do not know me. But really? She does not know what a Hush Puppy is and works in a Southern themed establishment. Again, kidding, our server was really great. Teacher here taught her something new so I am happy. I wish I knew her name. I want to send her a hug and a Hush Puppy T- Shirt. Hahahaha! I love you pretty, wonderful, smiley blonde server, unknown name, friend.  

So, all in all my birthday dinner was great! They open in August for lunches too. I'm so there. I predict every weekend since school will have started. Parking is fine despite other review. I have never had a problem. There are lots and street parking surrounding The Newton. There's also a huge Light Rail lot right across the street. Darn it! You might have to walk a NY quarter block. 

Enjoy Beckett's Southern Hospitality."
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"The red carpet, the lights, the cameras, the champagne. Get ready East Valley........ It's the..... Yelpies. ( Cue show music)

On a personal note, ""I would like to thank my Mother who made it possible for me to be here tonight. I would like to thank my teachers who never gave up on me and inspired me to be the best Elite I could be. I would like to thank ALL YOU AZ ELITES out there. And finally, I would like to thank tonight's sponsor, San Tan Village. 

""San Tan Village it's the place to be, Will you stop by and join me? 

Cosponsored by the Yelp planners. 

""When in town check out Yelp for great travel tips.""  

And now it's time for the review to begin......introducing your cohost for this review, ""Your Most Friendliest Yelper,""  Mary S. ( cue wild applause)  


It is 25 hours after the event and I am still full! Ha! And this was cutting myself off from any more food after the tenth vendor. What an amazing evening. You did not think a little rain would keep the Elite's' away did ya? So of course Hailey and staff were their always wonderful, amazing self and went all out. And Gabby was there!!!!!!!! Gosh, I was so happy to see Gabby.  

For this event it was a type of Scavenger hunt. Very similar to the last, ""Yelpies At High Street."" I was so happy to go because I have been wanting to go to San Tan Village for years now. I had never been. I also like this event concept. It makes ya work for your supper, so to speak. Ha! So, I was totally on board. Also, a few of the participating vendors I had not been to before so was very excited to try. The concept is fun and a great bang for your buck. You get to visit and try a whole lot of places, in a short amount of time. 

So you start out and get a passport, which is kind of like a bingo card. Then you head out and start walking. This is good because you will need it after stuffing your faces with: wine, champagne, food, cookies, Creme Brule, strawberries, pasta, meatballs, Brats, beer, popcorn, ummmmmm did I cover it all? Pretty much you name a food it was there.  And fun and cool shopping too. 

I am not the biggest shopper in the world, but a few of my favs were in the house tonight. Looking at you Z-.Gallerie, Aveda, Brighton, and Macy's. Z Gallerie, is one of my favorite places to shop. I always have time for a stop in there to look at all the pretties. My NY heart always has, and always will be with Macy's, yes please! Aveda has amazing and healthy scents and teas, and the bedding store even gave us these amazing pillows. Darn, they are so comfy! Last, but certainly not least, I even got a free album at Grace Records. Say what????? A record store? 

Grace Records gave away a free turntable. Which I need to complain to management that I did not win. You know, being the oldest and all. Wink, wink! Just kidding Hailey. Hmmm, or am I? (Insert Dr. Evil laugh with pinkie to chin)  So, let me explain to all you youngsters, what a record or album and turnstile is.""Okay, ready?"" A record is this round, disk th------------ okay, sorry I got distracted. Wink!

There were other fun things to visit too. Dick's Sporting Goods let us in their batting cage for a batting tournament. I got to try my luck at hitting the ball in the batting cage. I have not done that since I was like, ummmmmmmmmmmm five? I hit the ball 84 feet or so. I did not win a prize with that but Dicks Sporting Goods were sure, ""Good Sports"" ( see what I did there? ) and very generous with 6 gift cards to the winners. 

So, to summarize, each of the 20 vendors had a deal, food, drinks, or some other type of freebie or deal for us to try and raffle prizes. I would like to thank all of them. They were all amazing, welcoming, very kind and extremely giving to all of us. And there were a lot of Elite's in the house.

The evening ended with tons of gift cards, drawings, more freebies, Yelp Swag, and prizes galore. Then, ""Drum Roll please"" the moment we had all been waiting for. The announcing of the,""Yelpie Awards."" I did not expect to win anything and was so flabbaergasted to get one. Wow! My jaw is still on the floor over that. In fact, I even nominated someone else for the category award I won. Ha!!!!! 

When they called my name I didn't even respond because I figured Mike B would win a clean sweep in that category. Then, I realized he was part of a power couple now so stole the votes deservingly, in that category. Teehee! So I ran onstage to accept my award. No speech necessary.

Finally, did I mention there were birthday cookies involved? Just when you thought you could not possibly eat another bite. Happy Birthday Yelp. Can you believe it has been 15 years since Yelp started in San Francisco? Time flies when you are Yelping! I just ate my cookie and it was delish. I guess I was not as full as I thought. 

In conclusion, thank you Hailey and team for all you do. I can not even imagine how much work went into planning that event. You are all the best of the best and deserve your own, ""Yelpie Award."""
dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ,"The food has gone downhill since they closed the Scottsdale location and got new owners or cooks or whomever. I had not eaten here in a long time because the last few times I had been in the pizza was not as good as it used to be. I also had found a better place closer to home. Well, I thought I would give them another try tonight since the reviews are still good. It had been a long, hectic week at work. I happen to be driving by and I just wanted to sit down with my new book and eat. This was a very strange and demeaning experience. I have never had anything like this ever happen to me before. It upset me so I was compelled to write this update.  

This restaurant is very small. Too small for how popular it seems to be. They have only five tables in the place and if you sit at two of them it is very awkward since you are right by the kitchen door ( And in the way) or under the TV. I apparently forgot about that tonight.  It is certainly not a place to bring a party of fifteen and then book a party of eight. 

I walked in and there was a very long table of about 20 up against the wall. They really did not fit in the restaurant at all. The kids with them were very noisy and not being disciplined of course by any adults. The other three small tables were filled with diners looking non too happy at the noise level and squished floor space. I should have left right then and there but I was in no rush. I noticed that two of the ""Two Top"" tables were finishing up so I waited by the kitchen window to sit. Again, very awkward just standing there. I felt so in the way.  The server looked at me and said, ""Just give me just one minute. Here is a menu."" Well, I stood there for about fifteen minutes. 

A couple left shortly after that. I assumed the table would be cleared for me but it never happened. I stood by the window for five more minutes waiting. Finally, I sat down at one of the tables. A busser and a staff member walked by twice and no one cleared the table or acknowledged me. I started looking at the menu. After ten more minutes the waitress came back and said. ""So are you wanting to eat? I was flabbergasted. I am thinking to myself, ""What the heck?"" ""Well, YES! I do want to eat since this is a restaurant, right? But I meekly look at her, smile, and say, "" Of course."" Maybe she is having an off night with that crazy 20 top over on the wall. Needless to say I was very confused and starting to get frustrated. I wasn't sure how to answer or what she was trying to communicate. I assumed she forgot that she already asked me if I wanted take out or not. Not being a Harvard attorney I wanted to make sure to not go all postal on her.  

Well, the waitress finally asks, ""Well, do you want to eat here?"" I might note that she has made no effort to start clearing the dirty table either. So now I am very confused. Shall I eat here? What is that suppose to mean? Shall I eat here? Well heck no, maybe I will eat in the kitchen, bathroom, or on the floor? In the parking lot? I can only conclude they do not want my business. I am thinking to myself, ""Is this a joke? Am I on one of those reality TV shows? What is the problem here?"" I have no idea what is going on.

She then looks at me and says, ""Well, SHE said there is a reservation at eight.""( I still have no idea who ""SHE"" is.) I looked at my watch which said 7:10pm. Again, super confused hungry gal here. Also, what does this have to do with me anyway? The server finally gets her act together to tell me they have a table of eight coming in with a reservation, not a reservation at 8pm. Wow, reservations at this place, Really? Okay, I still had no idea when or why she was telling me this since I was at a Two Top not an Eight Top. The only other tables in the place were Two Tops that all together did not add up to eight. A reservation of eight would not fit anywhere in this place, anytime soon.

I finally looked at her, forcing her to communicate. ""So are you saying you do not want to serve me? Do you not have room for me?"" I hate being a mind reader on a Friday night after working with 8 year old kids all day. To this question the server replies, ""No not at all. She says ( Who the heck is SHE?)  that we can bring you food. It has to be fast and you have to eat it fast. We need your table."" Now I get it! I can not reply though because my jaw has fallen to the floor in utter shock at her request. I walked out on the spot.  

I was not sure how I felt about this. I totally understand having no room or a wait time. I even understand a reservation system since I eat out a lot. ( But shocked that such a divey place in the hood would take them) I can even understand they can not expand their space just for lil ole me. However, what I can not understand in any shape or form is why no one thought to tell me any of this before I wasted 30 minutes of my Friday night just standing there. Also, to tell a customer they need to rush their food intake, at an Italian place no less, is sinful!"
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"Don't come here. The owner Stanley is mean as hell.  This is not a place for yelpers, especially if you like taking photos. It has been so long since I've written a one star review and here it is...........

I was so excited about coming here since it is closed to my house.  As soon as we arrived,  I started taking photos wanting to share my dining experience with my fellow yelpers (like I've always done at any restaurant I've been to). While waiting for my food and wanting to snap a photo of their menus for my next visit,  the owner showed up from the kitchen saying this,  ""this is my restaurant and you need my permission to take photos "". I was in complete shocked and felt insulted.  I basically told him that I simply wanted to upload photos to share on yelps.  If he has a problem with that,  don't worry I am deleting them right now and walked away.  I was royally pissed off because of the approach he used to speak with me.

During my whole meal, the owner and the guy in the kitchen kept peaking over giving us dirty looks.  The poor guy at the cashier who took our order was lectured by the owner about how to handle similar situation.  I wouldn't be surprised if they split on our food.  I basically took a few bites of my order and trashed the rest away.  

Business owner who acts like this shouldn't be in business.  If you want complete privacy,  DON'T BE IN BUSINESS!!!!

P.S.  After completing some research online,  no wonder he was freaked.  This restaurant has health violation cited few weeks ago : https://www.maricopa.gov/EnvSvc/OnlineApplication/EnvironmentalHealth/FoodInspection?p=FD-46150&i=3954053"
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"I was on window vista for as long as I remembered. Apparently, it was so old that even IE stops updating on my outdated laptop. Some of my friends in IT even started laughing at what I had. OK fine! It is time for an upgrade. I get it Pffff!

I walked in on a busy Saturday afternoon. First, I was greeted by a trainee (first salesperson). Then, I was followed by her trainer (2 sales people now). I was getting annoyed...but in all fairness, she did ask me if it was ok. After being shown around and introduced to different types of laptops, I narrowed down to 2 choices. I tried calling my friend (computer expert) to get some opinion on which one to pick (if any), two other sales guys started showing up ear dropping on my calls (total of 4 salespeople now). I was so annoyed at that point I almost walked out. I felt like I was purchasing a car! As soon as I was off the phone, the sales crowd suddenly dropped down to just one person. He turned out to be a great sales guy (I think his name was Daniel). He answered every single question and concern that I had. He even pulled up best buy website and showed me other choices I might be looking for in comparison. 

In the end, I was happy with my choice at this store and ended up walking out with one. I admired his patience, knowledge and sales skills. He really knows his products. One of the functions wasn't working and the tech helped me to figure out today. I walked out of the store in 20 minutes. 

Overall, my experience here is good. They do need to lessen their sales technique. No customer likes to be followed by crowds. Other than that, I highly recommend this store."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"Outstanding service! Delicious food! Beautiful seating areas! If you want to impress your date, I will not take them anywhere else (and make sure you bring enough money to pay the bills. It's pricy but worth it). 

I was not aware of this restaurant until it is listed on the restaurant week menu. I don't normally drive more than 30 minutes from Chandler for food, but my friend repeatedly told me how outstanding their food was when they ate here last Saturday. We got lost for 10 minutes because the GPS kept telling us to turn right (when it was on the left LOL), but boy was it worth it.

We started our evening with a glass of wine, a blue cheese wedge and Shitake peppers. I was expecting the peppers to be spicy (possibly with lots of garlic)...to my surprise, it wasn't cooked that way at all. It was different than what I am used to but I am glad I tried it. For the main entrée, we had braised short ribs & mushroom Raviolis and Coffee Spice Duck Breast. I wanted it to be cooked medium rare and it was cooked exactly the way I like it (you still can see a little bit of pink right in the middle - that was beautiful). The duck meat was very tender and juicy. For desserts, we had Gelato (Vanilla and chocolate flavor) and sobie. Hmmm Hmmm hmmmm! It was so yummie. 

The server was attentive while giving us lots of privacy. He NEVER interrupt our conversation like most servers do at other restaurants. My small complain about that evening was the air conditioning. We were sitting at the corner table and I was starting to sweat 20 minutes in. Other than that, the night cannot be more perfect. 

I will most definitely come back here again."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"I used to come here when this location was Chino Bandido. I was sad to find out that it was no longer here. However, I am glad that another establishment opens up for me to try out. Today, it just seems like a good night to come over (while moonsoon is going on outside). 

The menu is pretty simple and prices are relatively reasonable. I wanted to try out so many dishes. For now, I would settle for their chicken wings.  I ordered 24 hot wings - half in honey BBQ flavor and the other half in ""hot"" flavor. For appetizer, we ordered onion rings. Onion rings were very crunchy and not overly oily. As for the chicken wings, I prefer the honey BBQ flavor over the ""hot"". Overall, I think they are both tasty. On my next visit, I definitely want to try their Korean flavor chicken and crazy crabs with a larger party.  

It was a slow night and there was only one server working. He told us that he just started working here a week ago. Even though we were his only table, he was very attentive - constantly checking up on us, giving us refill for sodas, and was super humble and friendly. While no one was watching (so he thought anyway), I saw him cleaning the tables and picking up around the place instead of standing around doing nothing. His hard working ethnics reminds me of the days when I was waiting for tables. We made sure to tip him generously especially because it was a slow night. If the owner is reading this, I want you to know what a great server he was and I hope you comp him well. I'll definitely come back here again to try something else. Hopefully I'll get the same server again.

P.S. If you like Soju (Korean wine), they do serve them here."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"I came back here again with high hope that everything would be as wonderful as the first time I was here.

Service: When I first walked in, the young hostess was paying more attention to people who walked in behind us. She left us waitjng and kept starring out the door. As soon as she noticed that they were still making their way in, then she re-focused back on us. She picked a table against the wall and I told her I preferred to sit by the window. I guess she wasn't happy that I picked another one and started giving me a bit of an attitude. I said ""thank you"" while she was walking away and she completely ignored me (trust me she heard me). I did watch her worked for a bit since I sat closer to the door. It doesn't take me long to notice that she hates her job. She carries the frowy face walking around and her attitude was uncalled her. 

Thankfully same server recognized us the first time we were here and ended up taking care of us again. Her service was as good as last time we were here, she even remember my ordered. Love her! She is attentive, friendly, and has a great working attitude. If it wasn't for her, I might downgrade my rating to a 2 stars. 

Food: when we got here, it was during happy hour. I ordered a Yellowtail roll off the happy hour menu and it was a bit chewy. I probably will not ordered that again. The spicy tuna roll (happy hour) and eel roll (off the regular price menu) were amazing. I highly recommend it. We also ordered a filet mignon dish with white rice. The meat was very tender and delicious. 

Rating: I will probably come back here one more time. If things stays the same, I might start looking for another sushi restaurant to go to."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"I am not a big fan of any Asian fast food restaurant. I dislike Panda Express or Pan Wei....and now a fast food restaurant that serves Thai Food in Arizona? That's the first. Since I was too lazy to cook and we received a coupon in the mail for this place, I figured I would give it a try.

The restaurant is definitely spacious, well decorated, and the menu is easy to follow. The guy who works at the counter is super friendly. He quickly introduced the menu to us. This particular menu allows you to choose (1) curry, noodles or other Thai dishes, (2) choice of chicken, beef, shrimps or tofu; (3) no spicy, mild, medium or hot. I ordered a drunken noodles with beef (medium spicy) and ended up with a drunken noodles with chicken. I wasn't going to say anything until the guy came up to us. I told him the order was wrong but I like chicken just as much. Even though I didn't care, I saw him checking the order receipt and notified the manager right away. On our way out, he even offered to give us another coconut drink for free. We didn't accept the offer, but was happy to see how much they care about their customers. 

I have to admit - their drunk noodles dish is as good as the one I have at other Thai restaurants. The noodles are very favorable covered with delicious seasoning. Chicken portion is so generous I ended up taking the rest back home. The coupon I received offered free dumpling (regular price $5). It is a little blend for my taste and I probably will not pay to order that. 

This place also has free delivery service if you live within 5 mile radius of this store. I cannot be more happier to have this Thai Chili 2 Go opening in my neighborhood. I'll definitely come back here again to try other dishes."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"After finished watching a movie at the Regal theater in Gilert, we were hungry for some good steaks. We pulled over, did a quick search & this restaurant was the first one that showed up on the list. Since we haven't been here & are always looking to try out new restaurants, we figured we would give it a try. 

When we first walked in, the restaurant was noticeably dark & it was playing relaxing music in the background. It reminds me a bit of Durants in Phoenix. While we were looking for the hostess, I've noticed several family photos hanging nearby the entrance. As it turns out, those are photos of both owner's fathers and the couple who owns the restuarant. Their menu also tells you the love story of the owners (how they met, their background & how they started the restaurant). To honor their fathers, they name the restaurant with their father's initials. Awwww....

Ok, for entree, we ordered a clam chowder. It tastes ok. However, their steaks are out of the world! We ordered a ribeye & 14oz prime rib. Both of them were simply juicy & delicious. I cannot be more happy with how my prime rib turns out. Thank you so much!

The service was simply outstanding. Our waitress is attentive, polite and friendly. When she boxed our leftover to go, she separated the fatty part of the steaks that I cut up for my dogs from the portion that I plan on having for tomorrow afternoon. She patiently opened up each box to show us how she puts our food away. Omg she is simply the best. 

On our way out, people in the kitchen who were standing nearby the kitchen, all waitresses & the owner (or the manager) all waive at us goodbye. I walked away with a happy stomach and a great experience. 

I will most definitely come back here again."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"Craving for chicken wings, we figured we would come here on a New Year Day. After our visit at the bar today, I really wish that we didn't. I had such a great experience when we came here few months ago. I had no idea what had happened. 

When we first arrived, we ordered two Sprites. I literally thought it was regular tab water with bubbles in it. When I realized it was the soda we ordered, we asked to switch them out to Coke instead (how can you mess up coke right?). Once again, it tastes so flat I simply couldn't take another slip. When we asked to switch them out the first time, our waitress looked extremely annoyed with us. She did not apologize once (and of course not the second time neither). When we asked to switch them out again to just a glass of ice water and lemonade, the manager showed up instead explaining that their soda machines have too much ice in it (no apology neither). At that point, we were afraid to ask for anything else. With hopes that at least we could enjoy the chicken wings, they were either too dry or too soaky. I ordered 6 flat wings and could barely finish 4 of them. My friend ordered a dozen and could only ate half of them. The only side dishes, celeries, that came with it were cut so thin and short. The service (other than the annoyed attitude we've got) was basically non-existence. She did smile in the end when the bill arrived to wish us a happy new year. We only tip her because we felt bad for not giving any (we really didn't think she deserves any). 

After our experience today, I really don't know if I would come back here again. I didn't expect Durant's services but the attitude we received for the sodas were uncalled for. It was a horrible experience and I hope the owner realized what had happened."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"Summoned for jury duty??? Oh kill me now!!!!! Can I pull a ""no English"" card? Meh....I'll just show up like a good old citizen. 

I showed up here at 8am like I was supposed to. I was shocked in seeing how spacious the waiting room was. When you first walked in, someone would show up out of nowhere helping you to get your badge. Front desk lady is helpful. The waiting room is definitely spacious and clean. Bathroom and coffee room are also available in the general area. TV is everywhere keeping you entertained and it would occasionally play a rerun on what you should expect to go through. A different video letting u know how to get financial reimbursements for your services. 

It took me over an hour to realize that there is a different general area (my fault for being lazy instead of walking around). If you need to work on a laptop or plugging in your electronics to an outlet while waiting, they have tables with 2 electronical plugs!!! I brought my phone cord but didn't bring the part that connects it to the outlet lol.....bring your COMPLETE power plug with you if you are going to be there all day. I was told that their is a cafe in the building (i didn't check it out).

They continuously serve free cookies and coffee with the donations that other juries who sign away their rights to get reimbursements. I didn't eat any of it but thought that was nice. Overall, it was a much nicer experience than I expected. Next time when I get summoned again, I wouldn't mind as much and will bring my phone cord chargers for sure.

P.S. Don't forget to get a slip from the front desk on your way out to either confirm that you were in the selection process or were there but not chosen. Your employer is going to need that if you want to get reimbursements."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"After tonight, I don't know if I will come back here again. 

Let me start with the seating arrangement. The restaurant still has at least 5 booths that were opened. I didn't think I'll need to special request for sitting there. They decided to sit us on a table for 4 in between 2 other tables that were full. The space was so tight that there was no way we could sit comfortably. As always, I asked to be re-seated. 

When we finally sat down, the waiter showed up asking us what we wanted to drink. During the meantime, you would think that someone would at least gave us a glass of water while waiting right? I didn't even notice it until I ate some salsa and tried reaching for the water. Nothing. Great! This is just great!

We started ordering our entrees. Food arrived at decent time. When we were done, the waiter didn't even give us a chance to order dessert and was ready to wrap things up. We stopped and told him that we wanted dessert. 

When we were done, we still wanted to hang around to catch up with friends. I guess the waiter feels that it was time for us to leave, he told us that we could pay with the machine on the table and that is that. After he said that, he never come by again. He stopped coming by to see if we want refills or maybe we wanted to order something else? 

I also would like to add that it is 40 or below tonight. All of us were wearing sweaters. The air circulation was so bad that we were all sweating at the restaurant. It was so stuffy and hot in there. 

All in all, the food is decent, but the service was definitely horrible. If management is reading this, please train your servers to continue offering service after bills were paid. We don't want to stay there for an hour after we are done with our meals. But seriously????"
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"I was invited by Jib to try out this new Thai restaurant a month ago. Since I was in the neighborhood and the weather is cold today, I figured this is the perfect day to try out spicy/hot Thai food. 

The interior of this restaurant is very modern and beautifully designed. I love the paintings and mirrors that are hang on the walls. When we first walked in, we were greed by a very friendly waitress. We started out by ordering Thai iced tea and egg rolls as an appetizer.  Their tea has the perfect portion of milk, tea and sweetness. I would have ordered another one if I had more room in my stomach. Egg rolls are very crispy, non-greasy and it goes very well with the sweet sauce that it was served with. For entrees, my friend ordered Red Curry chicken with rice (Thai spicy) and I ordered Drunken noodles with beef (medium hot). The curry is very tasty but it too hot for my taste. They offered generous portion of beef for my drunken noodles and it was so delicious. For dessert, we ordered Mango with sticky rice. Mango is so sweet with the perfect portion of rice covering with mouth watering coconut juice. Even though I was full, I finished 90% of it in less than 5 minutes. 

Jib's cousin stopped by to introduce himself and I also saw a older lady coming out from the kitchen to check on the business. As we crossed eye contact, she smiled at me from a distance. Generally speaking, I do not expect much customer service or cleanness from Asian restaurants. Not this one - they blew my mind away. Jib - thank you so much for inviting me to this family owned restaurant. Food is delicious and well decorated, the restaurant is clean and offers great customer service. I will definitely come back here again and I highly recommend this Thai restaurant to all Elite yelpers."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"This store caught my attention while I was having lunch next door. Even though I'm a foodie, I've never had an Omaha Steaks before. ""Let's go check it out"" he said. Since it was over 110 degrees out and I had no where to go,  why not? 

I was in shocked to see that all products were frozen and packed in boxes (again, I didn't know any better). First thing that caught my attention was the prices. I saw a box of 6 (Filet Mignon) for $300. My jar literally dropped. I ended up getting 4 pieces of Omaha steaks (9oz), a box of mash potatoes (8 of them) and a bottle of Omaha steak sauce just to try out.  

For the first time in my life, I've tried THE almighty OMAHA steaks. The first bite really got to me. It didn't taste like steaks that I normally had. After my 2-3 bites, I was in love. Why does it take so long for me to try something so heavenly??? Oh mama...gimme more. 

I gave it 4 stars mostly because of how tasty the steak was. My experience here, however, wasn't so great when we first walked in. I choose not dress up often and usually walk around with tan tops, cheap bag and a pair of sandals. I save my money on travelling and food rather than clothing but that is just me. Since we didn't dress up with fancy clothing, I guess the first sales guy who spotted us didn't feel like we were going to buy anything. We walked right by him and he didn't say one thing to us. As soon as someone else (well dressed) walked in. ""Oh hello! How can I help you?"". Seriously? The ironic thing was that person turned out buying nothing and left. Thankfully, another sales guy asked us if we needed help as soon as he was done with another customer. He was super friendly and helpful. That totally made up for the attitude we were given to. 

I'll definitely come back here again for some good steaks, but next time I will only buy when that nice sales guy is there."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"Since I wasn't able to get a table on their soft opening day and was determined to try their ramen noodles, I thought that coming here during the weekdays would give me a better chance of getting a table and better services. I tried calling their business number listed to make sure we can get a table this time. Unfortunately, it was a cell number and went straight to a voicemail. Apparently, their business phone has not been quite set up yet.

Taking my chances, I've decided to drive here anyway. Thankfully, I was able to get a booth at the corner of the restaurant. It allowed me to see what went on while waiting. First, services were extremely slow. No...there were some empty tables and it is during the weekdays. There were two waitresses when we were here and they simply lack basic waitressing training. For example, when we got our ramen noodles, we had to ask for soup spoon (really?). Secondly, tables next to us were here before we did & they got their food after we almost finished with our noodles. Needless to say, they weren't happy. 

To start, we ordered a spring roll. I took one bite and simply couldn't finish the rest of them. It was so smushy in the inside I simply couldn't take another bite. For main entrees, I ordered the spicy Tonkotsu. Ironically, it was not spicy at all. I'm not saying that it's mild. It isn't spicy period. I even tried the spicy miso soup & it wasn't spicy neither. Nevertheless, the brooth was decent & tasty. I only got few pieces of pork slices and was hoping for more. I was disappointed. 

Overall, my experience here was just average. I'm not sure if I will come back here anytime soon. Maybe I'll wait a few months when the business is settled to come back again. I still want to give it a 3 stars because the waitresses were trying and did apologize for many little things that weren't there. Also, I do enjoy the broth."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"I haven't been able to find a pair of black heels for a very long time. Within 10 minutes of walking into the store, I immediately found what I was looking for. Not only it is pretty, it is also comfy. I can't wait to break it in. Shoe boxes were definitely well organized. I could find different shoe sizes in different color easily. 

The lady who worked here last night was very friendly (at first). However, this is where the store started to lose my 5 star. First of all, the credit card machine is incredibly slow at reacting, but very quick to kick you out if you don't hit the button fast enough. It was very frustrating. Secondly, the lady told us that if we paid money towards charity, we would get an additional 15% discount. While I was waiting for the machine to react, I actually found the 15% discount coupon on my phone app. It took the machine another few minutes to react to this change and redo the whole thing again. After everything was said and done, she still guilt trip me by saying ""are you sure you don't want to donate money to help out the children? "" Have U guys seen the recent south park show when the cashier tried to shame the customer at the whole food store? That was how she made me feel. 

When it was my friends turned to pay, I simply walked out from the store waiting for him. Especially when i pulled up the 15% coupon for his separate purchase from the website, and she refused to use it saying that the machine probably wouldn't take it. Then, she pressure him to give donation just like she did to me in order to get his 15% discount (when I had a coupon for him too & it is advertise on their website and yelp app. I didn't feel like arguing with her non sense and left. The entire check out process took about 10 minutes. I was not happy at that point. Nevertheless, I'm glad to walk out with a pair of shoes that I like...and if I come back next time, I will probably bring cash."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"After we received a terrible customer experience at their service department yesterday, I received a call from the Service Director, Erik Bobesku, early this morning. He would like an opportunity to fix the situation that went wrong and we agreed to bring our car in once again. When we arrived at 4:00p.m. today and met up with an advisor, Austin Phipps, who assisted us with the 50,000 mile service. Since he had no prior knowledge of what had happened, that poor guy had to listen to this angry customer (me) with no fault of his at all. Nevertheless, he remained professional and understanding (unlike the other guy who just gave us our car key & sent us on our way - may I add it was stormy & pouring rain last night). Shortly after we arrived, Erik and Mike Tegge, the General Manager, both showed up. They apologize to us for the experience that we had. I was not angry with them, but was definitely still angry with the way how we were being treated. Erik sat across from us listening to our concern and how this experience has made us feel......it definitely made me feel better afterwards. 

Not only they offered me the maintenance service for free, they even got it done within an hour to save me from more hassle. I truly appreciate their friendliness and willingness to fix the situation. I just wish it wouldn't take a bad yelp review for them to try fixing it (hence I didn't give it a 5 stars). When I first arrived (before this incidence), I was happy to see this dealership in Gilbert. It is only 10 minutes from my house, clean, open, and have lots of selections on different types of beautiful Mercedes vehicles. I hate to say this....it looks MUCH nicer than the one off I-10 and Ray (sorry guys). 

When I want my next auto service done, I will definitely bring it back to Austin. I give credits when credit is due, they tried very hard to fix a mess up situation. I plan on getting a newer model in the future. When the time comes, this will be my first place to go."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"I didn't think there could be another steak house that is just as good as Durant or a Different Point of View until now. 

The restaurant is located at the 2nd floor of a plaza and I believe it was relocated from camelback a year ago. The exterior is not much to look at. However, the interior is beautifully decorated. Hostesses were friendly & well dressed. The tables are well layout with different plates, folks & knives (talk about elegant). Our waiter showed up shortly after we were seated introducing us their menus & different variety of drinks. It took my 2nd try to actually like the white wine that I picked. Not once he gave me any sort of an attitude and was being extremely patient with me finding the right wine to go with the meal. When we were ready to order the entrée, he highly recommended me to order the filet mignon. My friend ordered the chef special with a lobster Mac & Cheese. There was a bit of a wait to get our meals & our waiter never stopped keeping us posted on the progress. When the plates finally arrived, they were still hot until I had my last bite. The portion was just right for me and it was juicy and delicious. Nevertheless, it didn't taste nearly as good as the chef special. It was well seasoned with big portion. Every bite has a lot of flavor in it. I was extremely full, but still manage to make room for desserts. I ordered the ice-cream with two different flavor (vanilla and chocolate) & a cheese cake. It was a perfect way to end the meal. If you like coffee with liquor in it, they have them on the menus also. 

We walked out of here feeling full and happy. It was definitely a romantic setting for a date night. Food was great and service was outstanding. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try a nice steak and date night. 

P.S. I really wish they would have prime rib in their menu. I guess I'll have to go to Durant for that. Side dishes are not included with your entrée. Be prepared to spend some serious $$$ here."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"Let me starts by saying this: This restaurant has the best sushi in town. 

It was my friend's birthday and I wanted to take her some place special. My yelp friend, Karen, recommended this place to me. It's a bit of a drive from Chandler. But if it's good food, I'm willing to drive anywhere. I made a reservation for 2 at 5p.m. and was the first person who arrived. First hint that tells me they are legit was seeing a group of Japanese guys waiting for it to open when i arrived. Second hint - shortly after the door was opened, the restaurant was already packed. 

We ordered Aghi tofu and spicy squid as our appetizers. The aghi tofu is definitely the best I've ever had. The ""spicy squid"" that we ordered was not spicy at all. Nevertheless, I still like it. It was seasoned well and very juicy. Just the right amount of portion for appetizers. For our main entree, we ordered a sashimi combo to share and replace two pieces of clams with two additional pieces of tuna and yellow tail ($1 for each item you switch out, what a deal). Every single piece is fresh, delicious, and literally melts in your mouth. I cannot be any happier to order that. We also ordered Eel sushi (2 pieces each order) and it was cooked exactly to our liking. I love the eel sauce that comes with it. Super delicious!!!! 

I was a bit disappointed that the hostess did not tell our waitress that it was my friend's birthday. I reminded them upon reservation as well a reminding the hostess when i arrived. When our waitress gave us the bill, I told her that it was my friend's birthday. She politely took the bill away and arrived with the tempura ice-cream. Even though she didn't bring back the ""green tea"" ice-cream that we specifically asked for, it was still delicious. They literally shut off all the lights at the restaurant and sing to my friend along with the guests. She was sooooo happy.

Overall, this has been a wonderful experience for my friends and I. You bet I'll come back here again. Thank you for the wonderful time!"
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"When was the last time you go to a local restaurant and was personality greeted by the owner? When was the last time the owner shoke your hand asking you for your name and open the door for you on your way out? Wimply is it! This is a family owned restaurant and the server of this lovely morning is the owner's wife and the daughter. 

I have visited just about all restaurants in downtown Chandler and unfortunately did not even notice this one until now. Since we love biscuits and gravy, we've decided to come here and give it a try this Sunday morning. I ordered the French toast with slices of bananas and a side of egg. The French toast is thick and fluffy. However, the syrup was a bit too sweet for my taste. It would be nice if there's different choices in flavor or less sweeten. Overall, I still think that it was delicious and worth trying. I also took a bite of the biscuits and gravy dish (only served on Sunday morning) - it was ABSOLUTELY heavenly. It is not salty like other places I've been to and the biscuits were so soft that it melts in your mouth. I will definitely order that again on our next visit (and not sharing next time). 

Food are served on paper plates, plastic bowls, folks and knives. It doesn't bother me at all as long as the food is good. The restaurant has approximately 10 tables or so. If you have a huge party coming over (over 4 people), just be aware of the size of this place and might want to call ahead of time. Apparently, this establishment is also known for their burgers and hot dogs (and was featured in local magazines). The owner, Randy, showed us the magazine while we were waiting for our food. He said to us: ""this is not a fancy restaurant, but I'm proud to be on the magazine as a moms and pops shop owner"". You should have seen the proud look on his face. He makes me want to reach over and gave him a big hug. 

I love supporting local restaurants that is not a chain or franchise. I'll definitely come back here again with friends to try them out again. I highly recommend this place to my fellow yelpers."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"If you love prime ribs and seafood as much as I do, this is definitely a place to be. This restaurant is well decorated, cocktail is delicious and definitely gives out an relaxing atmosphere to hang out with friends or your love one (date night is highly recommended). 

To start off, I ordered a ""Firebird Signature Martini"" ($10). I am not a big drinker, but generally prefers fruity cocktail that is not overly sweet. This drink is delicious especially if you like pineapple flavor. The complimentary bread was still hot when it was served (best way to start off your meal on a Friday night). For appetizer, we ordered the crab cakes and came with two pieces. The dish was well decorated and goes great with the orange sauce. If you plan on ordering this dish, don't forget to pile up the veggies in the middle of the plate and eat that with it. Your taste bud would love experiencing different flavor all at the same time. 

For main entrée, I ordered a 12oz Prime Rib (medium rare). It was so juicy and tender I literally finished it within 15 minutes (or less). My friend ordered a filet mignon a side of lobster tail. They messed up the order and brought us shrimps as a side instead. We waited an additional 15 minutes to get it corrected and they were apologetic. Filet Mignon was also tender and juicy. Personally, I will still choose prime rib over it (personal preference). When the meal was finished, I was so full and simply do not have any room for dessert. 

I did see the waitress stopping by the manager to see if he could do something about the bill due to the mix up. Unfortunately, they've decided not to comp anything (perhaps throw in a free dessert?). I was not there expecting anything for free, but we were definitely shock that they did nothing. I guess they would only comp customers who throws around an attitude, screaming and yelling when the meal was wrong. Since we were being nice about the whole mixed up, we ended up getting nothing. 

Other than that, our experience here was wonderful. I'll definitely come back here for another cocktail and delicious meal with my girlfriends."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"We were here yesterday to celebrate fathers Day early and was excited to try out a new restaurant. I really wish we would have picked a different place. 

When we first arrived, the restaurant just barely opened. A waitress and the owner welcome us to come in. The owner directed us to a table but I preferred to sit on booth. We asked for permission before sitting. She agreed. Then I realized I'm 100 lbs less than my dad and it was a tight fit for him. We got back up to sit on the table instead. I could see the owner giving us a look that says ""I told u so"". I don't know what the big deal is since there was no one else there at that time. 

Then, the owner asked my dad if we wanted appetizer. He said no. The owner actually said ""ok"" followed by rolling her eyes up. Seriously? When I ordered my dish, she asked me a question and I thought I heard medium or medium rare. I said medium rare please. Then she looked at me like I'm stupid ""we only serve it medium or rare. I'm asking you which one is it that you want""? Ok at this point I already know I am not coming back regardless how good the food might have been. 

We have a table of 4. One meal arrived 15 minutes before everyone else. Her food started to get cold and we basically told her not to wait for us. All of our meals arrived at different time but that isn't a big deal for me. 

I tried the swedish meatballs and it was a bit too salty for my taste. The sauce is a bit watery. The hunter steak was a bit chewy so I didn't finish it at all. 

We paid our bills the already included gratuity (so tipping a different amount isn't even an option). 

I would have come back and tried something different if it wasn't for the bad attitude. My uncle is from Switzerland and I was going to bring him here. Apparently if you do speak her language, she would be a lot nicer. Another table came in later and she was the sweetest thing. Wow. 

Overall, the service is below average, the attitude is bad and the food is no more than average. I always want to support family business but probably not this one. If you think you are too good to serve customers, may be u shouldn't have a restaurant."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"I cannot think of a better place to host a girl's night out. Sel is beautifully decorated, offered excellent customer service and they serve delicious/well decorated 4 course meals for $70 per person. The presentation is truly amazing. 

I've made a reservation for the 7 of us and the table was ready as soon as we walked in. We were immediately welcome by our server. As the girls came in one by one, he paid close attention to our table making sure we got our drinks/order as soon as possible. Since I had a destinated driver for the night, I ordered the Barbara Jean ($14: Fords Gin, Giffard Strawberry Liqueur, Chamomile Syrup, Lemon Juice) that was highly recommended by our waiter. It has just the right amount of sweet and I definitely enjoyed it. For my 4 course meals, I ordered a Smoked Lobster Stuffed Squash Blossom (roasted corn puree, pickled Bing cherry), Yellow Tomato Gazpacho, Copper river salmon Gravlaz Salad and Duck breast for main entrée. Everything was delicious except the Yellow Tomato Gazpacho. I simply am not used to having my soup served cold, but my friends all seem to like it. The duck dish was so tender, juicy and delicious and I will definitely order that again. I also tried a bite of my friend's filet Mignon. It was juicy and tender. For dessert, I ordered the strawberry short cake. It was a bit too sweet for my taste and I honestly don't care for it much. I wish they have more choices in dessert, but that was the only choice they offer last night. 

Overall, my experience here was amazing! I made a reservation 3 weeks ago for a table of 12 (before 5 girls dropped out on me). They called me the day before asking if we were ok to seat us in the patio area. Needless to say, I was not happy to be asked one day before our reservation. Nevertheless, they were nice about it and ended up seating us in the best area at the restaurant. With that said, keep in mind this restaurant isn't for big group setting due to its size. If you have a party bigger than 8, I'll recommend you to go somewhere else. This is, however, a great place for a date night with your love one. 

Thanks again for the wonderful evening Sel."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"We are regular customers at a restaurant next door. Since there wasn't a sign up outside, we didn't even notice this place until we walked by few weeks ago. We couldn't be any happier to give it a try. 

The restaurant is definitely well decorated, very open and spacious with tall ceiling. The bar area is located in the middle of the restaurant with lots of TV hanging up at the top. If you want to enjoy the beautiful weather of Arizona, watching sports while enjoying a beer or a glass or wine, this is definitely the place to be.

Since I am a observer, I picked a table in the very back watching everything that was going on. Servers were definitely attentive. They paid attention to all tables  (not just the one they are assigned to). Very friendly, smiley and approachable. When was the last time you met the master chef walking around asking if you enjoy the food???? He certainly did here. We ordered a fried bread for dessert that was heavenly! A smiley bright Young man literally walked by and asked us which one was our favorite dipping sauce (mine is chocolate). We felt so honored to have met him. You could clearly tell he does care if you like his food or not. I also saw 2 co-owners of the restaurants watching the entire operation. They treated their guests with respect...no matter old or young, black or white, yellow or brown....ah...I enjoyed spending my Friday here so much. Apparently, the owners own multiple businesses in the area. They use glasses made by his business. They are beautifully made & you can tell it wasn't one of those cheap one you buy from the regular supermarket. With that said, please don't drop it! Those water glasses are expensive lol. 

For appetizer, we order pork belly & chicken lollipop. For my main entree, I ordered ozzo bucco dish. The meat was so tender it literally falls off the bone. If you've never had it, it almost taste like a pork roast. It goes so well with my glass of wine. And the dessert! OH MY LORD...you have to ask about the fried bread or I promise you you will regret not ordering it. It came right out of the fryer and it's super delicious. You just have to trust me. It's a MUST ORDER item. 

I'll most definitely come back here again."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"If I ever get to choose what I want for my last meal on earth, I'll say ""the prime rib and strawberry short cake at Durant"". Oh yes yelpers...it was that good. 

When we first arrived, we walked through the kitchen to get to the receptionist. We all thought we must have gone thru the wrong entrance. No...they later explained that they want their guests to see the people who cook our food (what a great idea). Kitchen isn't big but it is definitely clean and organized. I was very impressed. The restaurant is very dark in the inside, but its bright enough for you to see all the historic photos hanging on the wall right next to you or from a distance. From what I was told, this restaurant has been opened since 1960's. The elegant old school decoration is definitely appreciated. As we looked around, we've noticed that we were the youngest people on the table. Most guests are at least 40's and up. Perhaps most youngsters prefer fast food over dining at a elegant restaurant such as this. Or maybe because their food is relatively expensive lol. I've found that very interesting. 

Shortly after we were seated, waiter, Patrick, came over to introduce himself. He knows the menu extremely well and told us about their specialty and their best items on the menu. The manager, Chris, came over and introduced himself multiple times. He was making lots of small talk with us to make us feel very welcome. The service here is definitely outstanding. The complimentary bread was covered with delicious sauce. The only reason I didn't finish it was because I was saving room for a steak. I ordered a 12oz slow roasted prime rib for my entree. It was so juicy and delicious. It was so tender that I could tear it off without cutting it with a knife. My friend ordered a rib eye and it was equally delicious. As for dessert, we all shared a strawberry short cake. That was my first time having it BTW....it has just the right amount of sweet and the strawberry wasn't too over powering. Every bite makes me feel like angels were dancing in my mouth. Oh yes it was that good. 

We all left this restaurant happy and satisfied. If I could, I will come here everyday. If you are a meat lover and enjoy fine dining...you won't find another place better than this. 5 star all the way"
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"I was here to celebrate my birthday last night. After choosing between Durants and a Different Point of View, I cannot be more happier to have chosen this place in the end. The atmosphere was as beautiful as I last remembered it. The amazing view from our dining table remains unchanged. I cannot think of a better place to end a perfect evening with friends.

Last time I was here was over 3 years ago. Their menus (especially the dessert) have changed a lot since then. They currently offer a summer pre-fix menu (appetizer, main entrée and dessert) for only $39.95. Normally, a single dish alone already cost just as much. If budget allows, I highly recommend you to come here before this special ends. Since I didn't see anything that caught my attention (until I tried my friend's dishes after the fact), I've decided to order it from the regular menu last night. For my main course, I had the Roasted Duck and a Classic Tahitian Vanilla Bean Crème Brulee for dessert. Roasted Duck was a bit dry for my taste. Overall, it was still tasty. My dessert had just the right amount of sweet and it was beautifully decorated. 

All of my friends ordered 3 courses prefix menu. I was able to try a little bit of everything (benefit of having foodie friends). I wish I would have ordered the Seared Stone Fish instead. The portion was generous and delicious. My other friend was a bit disappointed at the Shrimp Ravioli (Basil Pesto, Summer Greens, Garlic Chips, Sweet Corn Reduction). It was tasty, but it only had a tiny bit of shrimp in it. My second choice in dessert would be the Peanut Butter & Chocolate (Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Mousse, Honey Caramel, Cocoa Peanuts, Caramelized Banana Ice Cream). 

All dishes were beautifully decorated; atmosphere is amazing and service was outstanding. Which is why a Different Point of View has earned a 5 star review from me. I will definitely come back here again on special occasion. Be aware when you are driving up to the restaurant. The road is narrowed and parking is a bit hectic. Valet is available. Even though formal attire isn't required, I highly recommend it :) 

P.S. Reservation can be made through ""Open Table"" and here is the link for their summer prefix menu: http://www.tapatiocliffshilton.com/interactive/pdf/1467329535.46Summer%20Prix-Fixe%20only%20for%20resort%20web%20page.pdf"
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"Let me start by saying this - ""DON'T COME TO THIS PLACE! HIGH PRESSURE SALES AND THEY ARE STALKERS!!!!!""

I would give this place a negative 5 stars if I could. We planned on shopping for a truck on a relaxing Saturday afternoon. As we pulled into the dealership area, we were stopped by a ""security guard"" asking us what we were doing there. During our conversation, I could see him sizing us up (what kind of car are they driving now? what kind of watch are they wearing, etc). We CLEARLY told him that we did not need ANY assistance and simply wanted to browse around ON OUR OWN. I guess he decided not to listen. 

As soon as we parked our car, we were looking for a restroom before started walking around. A sales guy flew out (literally) from a closed room door asking us what we needed help with. I was in a bit shock since we didn't ""run into him"". Great! The guy at the front (when we pulled in) either tipped this guy off or they have an employee room with a hidden camera stalking their customers. Got it. I IMMEDIATELY told him that we were just looking around and went into the restroom really quick. I was done before my friend did. While I was waiting outside, I saw this creepy sales guy still peeking from a distance between the plants until he came out from the restroom too. Then, he quickly jumped out and FOLLOWED US from the restroom to the show room harassing us. At that point, I told him REALLY LOUD that WE DO NOT NEED ANY HELP AND WE CAN HELP OURSELVES THANK YOU! Even after I expressed in anger, he continued to follow us and forced me to take his business card on our way out. I went from a relaxing/happy mood into a completely stress out mood within 5 minutes of pulling into their dealership. 

If the sales guy is this crazy before we even take an interest in a car, I can't imagine if we actually wanted one. At that point, I threw his business card away and quickly jumped back into my car as fast as I could (just in case he might follow us with his car too). We went to a different dealership intead. If the owner is reading this, this is NOT a way to treat your potential customers. Give them time to breath! Give them time to look and take an interest in a car! If I am slightly interested or needed help, trust me I will look for them. STOP THIS HIGH PRESSURE HARRASSING SALES TECHNIC! 

I will NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER come here again nor will I recommend anyone to come here. They are simply crazy (or desperate)! If you want to know how it feels like to have a stalker, this is the place to be."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"I was having a stressful work week and feeling completely tense even after it was over. My stomach felt like there was a knot and needed something to be done right away. On my way home, I called up Karen W to see if she had any dinner plan. She said no (WOOO HOOOO!!! happy dance) and that was how we ended up here last night. 

As soon as we arrived, a table was already reserved/set up for us. The restaurant is definitely well decorated with dark walls, a wall decorated with many pieces of small mirrors and with lots of beer bottles in the middle of the bar table. I can see this place getting really busy during the weekends for college kids. If you are here with your date, this place could also be relaxing and romantic. Throughout the entire meal, we ordered many skewers and appetizers to share with including (but not limited to) Aghi Tofu, poki bowl, Korean beef, chicken wings, sushi burritos, cheese spam, quail eggs, asparagus, meat balls and finishing up the entire meal with a beautifully decorated Eel dish. My favorite was the poki bowl and the sushi burritos. Both dishes were so refreshing and the rice was just at the right temperature. My second favorite was the Eel dish. The presentation was so good I almost didn't want to eat it. I've always enjoyed inexpensive small bites which allows me to try different variety of food. Everything is tasty except the cheese spam that we ordered. I cannot taste the spam and the only taste that was left in my mouth was the cheese. It was too overpowering for me. If you like cheese, however, this might be it for you. 

During dinner, I did see the owner walking around checking up on everyone from a distance at the corner of my eye. I thought that was sweet. I would have given this restaurant a 5 star if it wasn't because our waitress was throwing around an attitude when we first got here. She walked away without taking my friend's order. Instead of apologizing, she walked back with an attitude showing us know that she was annoyed. I wasn't very happy with that. However, her attitude did improve towards the end of the night and did check up on us often. I do appreciate her attitude adjustment.

If you are a fan of Korean/Japanese food as well as soju and sake, this is the place to be. I did see some happy hour menu with reasonable prices. We ate so much and the total only comes to $75 including tax. I will most definitely come back here again to try something else. Thank you Karen W and Zu Lazkaya for making my night better. I walked away happy towards the end of the night."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"My friends and I love going outside of our comfort zone and try different ethnic food once in a while. We all planned a week ahead of time to eat at this local Spanish restaurant in Scottsdale. Personality, this was my first time trying Spanish food. I was very excited all week looking forward to come here. This general area is almost like a maze. It did take us a while to find out where it was located at. No matter if it was a good restaurant right? When we first arrived, I was impressed by their beautiful decorations and relaxing atmosphere in the patio area. I wanted to sit in the outside. But since it did rain here and there. It was best to sit in. That was when all hell broke loose. 

Shortly after we seat down, the hostess gave us total of 4 menus. Two of which involved alcohol beverages. To avoid the clutter on the table since none of us were drinker, I politely asked her to take those two menus away. She looked annoyed and unhappy. Whatever. When our waiter arrived, he also started talking about drinks. I immediately told him the same thing again. Most high end restaurant would be smart enough to pick up all the wine glasses at this point in time, he didn't. We had to ask him instead. He responded by saying ""I will in a minute"" when we were the first table who arrived here. Hmm...r u too busy? He immediately rushed away from our table when we were all ready to order our drinks. This is definitely a bad start for a supposedly nice dining experience. While we were waiting for our drinks, I could hear someone in the kitchen yelling for another person for a minute straight. Really...? Staffs were all loud talking among each other as though we weren't even there. I definitely did not expect that from a nice restaurant in Scottsdale. 

The food. Where should I begin? Every other clams that I chewed on have sand in it. My friend bite into one of the few and literally hurt her tooth. Unacceptable. I don't even want to bother with describing the taste of each individual dish. All I could tell u was their presentation was beautiful. But the food was tasteless. The Paella that I tried was covered with grease and the rice was soaked in too much juice. It might have been presented in a steel pan but trust me..it was precooked and reheated back up. I was extremely unsatisfied with the meals and the shitty service that we received. The waiter hardly gave us refill unless he was asked over and over again. He quickly rushed in and out of our tables even when it wasn't busy. 

The only reason I still give it a 2 star is because their dessert was very delicious. Especially their homemade coconut ice cream that was served on a coconut. Their churros was served with chocolate syrups. That was heavenly delicious. I don't mind paying for a expensive meal when the food and service was great. But really...it was not worth it. I advice you to go somewhere else and save your money."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"Let me starts by saying this: I am a believer but also a skeptic. I am a believer because I think there is more to this life than what we can see with our own eyes. I believe in life after death. I don't believe that we exist just to die and then vanish in the thin air. I believe some of us have the ability to see and feel things that most of us can't. I believe there are forces on this earth that we are yet to understand. I am a skeptic because I don't let my emotion leading me down a path believing in just about anything that a psychic says. Or allowing them to create fake stories based on reaction I have when questions are being asked. With that said, I showed up here with suspicion while keeping an open mind at the same time. Power of suggestion is a dangerous thing, but that doesn't mean you should lose faith neither. 

When we first arrived, we came straight to the address listed on yelp (108 E Park Ave). We rang the door bell several times and found out that Suzi (the psychic/business owner) moved to an office building that is only a block away. After meeting in the office, she quickly introduced herself to us, letting us know what to expect and we quickly started with our psychic medium reading. My reading lasted for an hour. There was a lot of information for me to think through. It was extremely hard to remember everything that was said. Thankfully, she does allow (and encourage) you to record the whole session for a play back later (and I listened to it at least 20 times after that).

I was here to connect with someone I love who passed away many years ago. Many information that Suzi gave me were already a given. For example: I was close to this person; this person loves me very much; this person cares about me, etc. If I came here to connect, certainly I was close to this person enough for me to reach out. The possibility of this person loves me back is pretty high. However, she did give me information that was spotted on without any knowledge about me. For example: she described my personality to the ""T""; she knew I am good in business; she knew I have future plans to help others. I tried validating several information by asking specific events that took place in the past. Unfortunately, she told me my deceased love one was ""stubborn"" and would not share any information with her. The validation on certain detailed was a bit off, but that doesn't mean she isn't a real deal. It only means I didn't get the validation the way I wanted to. One thing did shock me after listening to the recording was her comments about my past life. I didn't realize at the time, but I did start remembering things that I did when I was a child that seem odd at the time but started to make sense now. 

Overall, I did leave the office with a little bit of confusion, comfort and reassurance at the same time. I know, it sounds confusing because I am very confused myself LOL. Perhaps it will take me a bit longer to take all of it in and understand everything that I was told. I do highly recommend Suzi to anyone who would like to give physic medium a try. Come here with an open mind and the message you will receive might surprise u more than u think."
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"I am a believer of super natural power but am also a skeptic on how good some of these so called psychics really are. Based on my experiences in the past, these self-proclaimed psychics asked you a serious of questions at the beginning of the session and begin psycho-analyzing you. Based on your reaction to certain questions/subject, they either give you additional information after you validate what they think you want to hear, or they go completely sidetrack. Power of suggestion is a dangerous thing. I feel that many people would believe in things that make no sense just because they wanted to believe it. Some other feedback you receive are basically a given, such as: ""Oh...they love you so much....they are still around you....they are so proud of you"". Well, if you are there to connect with love ones, chances are that person loves you too. Everyone wanted to hear those statements from their deceased that they are proud of them. To me, they are nothing but a good people reader and/or phony all together. Then, I met Dawn.

I found Dawn on some random search on yelp. Since my birthday is coming up, I figured I would do this as a gift to myself. I've done extensive research on her background & reputation(literally). Since I didn't find anything negative, I figured I would give her a try. I walked in expecting the worse. I had absolutely zero expectation. I was getting my mind ready that this is probably a waste of money again (this is my third time meeting a psychic in many years). When we first sat down in her room, I felt an overwhelming sense of sadness that has nothing to do with me (I still don't know what that was about). She only spent 10 minutes giving me a run down on how she connects with the spirit world and the session immediately began. I do not want to share the details of the session since they are very personal to me. HOWEVER, spirits who came through were people whom I least expected. They delivered messages that were undeniably real. She could even recall events that only my closet friends knew about. Rather than focusing on analyzing if she was a real deal, I spent majority of the hours in complete shock. Unfortunately, I was not able to confirm identities of some spirits who came through (since I've never met few of them in my lifetime), but the additional info that connect them to me was pretty much spot on. At the end of the session, I walked out knowing more than I thought I would know. I sat in my car for another 10 minutes nearby her driveway in complete shock before driving away. 

I cannot tell you how much I like dawn and here is why: 
- She posted her prices on her website. No gimmick, no trick, it's all on there.
- She response to text messages quickly.
- She is very kind and sensitive to what you are going through.
- I've done lots of research on her prior to the appointment. I haven't found one negative review on her anywhere. 
- There is no language barrier. Spirits around me only speak foreign languages. They communicate by showing her imagines and letters. If English isn't their first language, it wouldn't be an issue at all. 

If you are interested in visiting her:
- Please have all of your questions ready on a piece of paper.
- If you want to connect with anyone in specific (especially if they are not blood related), bring their names, DOB and a photo of the person if possible.
- She does allow voice recording (and I highly recommend it). I would not recommend video recording as the lighting does affect her ability to connect. 

Will I visit her again? OH GOD YES!"
j_j4DLfvNkhCRNWC0VBS9g,"**********WORSE SHOP EVER!!!!!!!***************

I've never changed my rating from a 5 to a 1 before but here it is! I bought my bike and accessories here. I recommended my friends and neighbors to come here until...well...one of our bikes that we brought in felt apart. 

We found a Groupon to do a tune up few months ago. Excited to start biking again, my hubby and I brought in our bikes for a tune up. Mine is a regular mountain bike and his is a high performance mountain bike. The first mechanic there helped my hubby to change a brand new back tire to match with the front wheel. Within the past few months, either the chain came off or the back wheel kept popping off. My hubby took it back in two times after our first tune up. We are reasonable people. We might not be happy with the constant issue. But as long as the issue is fixed, we are cool with it. 

Finally, two weeks ago we decided to ride our bikes in the neighborhood. I saw the wheel and chain came off within 30 seconds of him sitting on the bike. The bike flipped up and I saw him almost going face down on the floor. Thankfully he quickly put his leg down to catch himself from falling off. I was in shock that I've lost word. My husband rarely gets upset. He was very angry and we both drove down to the shop. The second mechanic who fixed his bike twice said he didn't know what was wrong. Then, he started telling him that his frame on his bike is ""bend"" and would need to get a new bike. I was so upset at that point and demand to speak with the owner. 

She was at the shop at the time. She told us to leave the bike with them and they would try to figure out what was wrong with it. During the meantime, she kept asking him how he carried the bike to his truck and even went on saying that she remembered him carrying the wheel into the shop without the bike last time etc....she said she would go through all the video footage to see what happened. All in all, she was trying to find ways to blame the situation back on us. She kept saying it wasnt their fault. 

Two days went by, he finally called the shop to see what happened to it. They said they tried calling the day before and the number was disconnected (what???). She told us to go down there and meetup with her most experience mechanic because he couldn't find what was wrong with the bike. 

Since I wanted to make sure that the owner would not question us as if we were criminal like last time and place the blame back on us, we brought our family attorney along to the shop. All of a sudden, she was much more polite and quiet than the first time we met her. The third mechanic told us that the frame isn't bend at all and everything is working right (I guess the 2nd mechanic was wrong?). He didn't place any blame on anyone nor trying to say that it was our fault. Finally we walked out with the bike. We haven't ride on it since then because he is afraid of getting hurt. Because next time when he does get hurt, a lawsuit is definitely all the way. 

I am disappointed not only because his bike took a few times to be put together correctly (if it doesn't fall apart again that is), but more on the level of customer service this place provides to its customers when issue arises. The second mechanic blamed the first guy who tuned up the bike and the owner tried to blame us for the bike falling apart. We were not there to ask for a new bike or for money. All we were asking for was to make sure his bike is put together correctly so we can ride safety. The owner was so defensive and so quick to place the blame back on us. Other yelpers were right. Don't come here. Especially if you don't want to get hurt."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"My sister loves Mexican food, so I figured I would take her to a Mexican restaurant for her birthday. I wanted to try someplace I have never been and it was a gorgeous day, so we decided to check out Round the Corner Cantina =]. The back patio is what brought us in- we arrived rather early, around 5:20pm and the back patio was already packed. We were able to squeeze in on the end of another party's table. 

I ordered the elotes (sweet corn on the cob with cheese and spices) to start. WOW. This was honestly some of the best corn I have ever had. The flavor was amazing and it was such a unique dish! $5 for one single corn on the cob though, was a little steep. My sister ordered a cheese quesadilla. I have had corn tortillas in the past, but these were the thickest I have ever had. My sister hated the quesadilla- and I could see why. It was difficult to eat and wasn't very cheesy at all. She was able to eat one of the quesadillas and I took the others home in an attempt to eat them later. I ended up throwing them away because the flavor just wasn't there. I ordered the pollo pibil tacos (roasted chicken). They were a little spicy, but the avocado salsa and pickled red onions cooled it down nicely. They weren't bad- but were nothing super impressive or memorable at all. The tortilla also didn't bother me as much in the tacos as it did in the quesadillas. We also shared an order of fried rice, which was good. I did need to add hot sauce for additional flavor though. Since we came during happy hour, our chips and salsa were free- saving us about $4-5. The salsa was very watery (as a lot of homemade salsas are) but very good. It had a slight kick to it, which I loved. The chips were clearly made in house and were sprinkled in sea salt and were pretty good. We also ordered a grilled green onion as well, which was literally a grilled green onion with oil, pepper and salt. It was also pretty good and gave me a new idea for summer grilling! Our server was very friendly and accommodating to my sister and I. He was busy but remained attentive to our table the entire time =].

My overall rating would be 2.5 stars but I rounded up. Average food, tortillas that are too thick for my liking, awesome back patio. I'm thinking the only time I will come back is if a friend suggested it for happy hour."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I was looking for a spot for my coworkers and I to have lunch in Shadyside and came across Girasole. I had never heard anything about it before, but it was close to our office and had decent reviews, so we decided to check it out!

Upon arriving, I realized that I had walked past this charming little place many times without noticing it! It is directly next to Eden, and is right off of Walnut. I LOVED the entire feel of this cozy little place. The sunflower door handles, the stone walls, charming art work and unique bronze colored tables all made me feel like I was stepping into a little corner restaurant in Italy! It is very tiny inside- I felt lucky to be visiting during a non-busy time of 11:30 am and not a Friday night at 7pm. 

Our server was friendly but did not give EXTRAordinary service. I felt as if she was a little rushed with us as she took our orders and did not speak entirely clear. My co-worker had to ask for clarification a couple times when it came to the question, ""Soup or salad?"" because she had asked it so quickly. My other co-worker also wasn't impressed when she reached over one of our plates in order to retrieve another plate. I, on the other hand, am pretty forgiving with minor mistakes and did not take offense to that at all. She was attentive to our table, refilled our waters when needed and cleared the table of our dirty plates as soon as we finished our salads/meals. 

I ordered the spinach and ricotta ravioli. We had the option of soup or salad with our lunch and I chose the salad. The salad wasn't very large, but consisted of spring greens, thin slices of red onions, pine nuts, chickpeas, one baby tomato, an olive and shredded carrots. I found the vinaigrette to be wonderful- light but packed with flavor. The pine nuts really added a much needed crunch to the salad as well. Our table was also served a small basket of bread. The bread was fresh and fluffy and very good, but nothing spectacular.

The spinach and ricotta ravioli was delicious! The ravioli were rather large and only came with 4 for the lunch portion. It was plenty though! raviolis were filled with spinach and ricotta and were cooked perfectly.The sauce was creamy and packed with delicious flavor. As many other yelpers mentioned, they were heavy on the sauce, which I LOVED. I really enjoyed dipping my bread in the sauce and eating forkfuls of it- very tasty!

Will be back!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I was so excited to check out this new brewery in Homestead! I live close by and am always quick to support the local businesses in the Homestead area. My boyfriend and I visited on a Friday night. I was expecting a long wait, but we were pleasantly surprised when we were sat right away. There are plenty of tables here. 

Regarding the beer, I honestly wasn't blown away with anything. The beers I had were not bad, but they also didn't offer any flavors that were notable enough to really remember or run back for. I had a flight and Brendan had the Oktoberfest. My favorite beer out of the flight was the Yusi Fruit- not too sweet, not too hoppy, and very flavorful. 

Regarding the food, we tried an appetizer and shared a pizza. Here is what confuses me about this place- I had trouble figuring out their identity. Their food menu is really different, but it has no identify. There are a lot of Mexican dishes, then a lot of pizza dishes, and then fancier entrees. This isn't your typical brewery food, or even easily shareable food besides the pizza. Make your own conclusions on the food options, but I do wish they had some type of theme with their food offering and offered more items that could be easily shareable. We tried the curried chicken croquetas ($10) and the proscuitto & feta pizza with fennel pistachio sauce ($14). The croquetas were very good, but expensive. 4 croquetas for $10 is a lot, and again, not something that is shareable for a group. Sure if you have 2-4 people, but that's it. However, I will say that flavor was really good with these. The pizza was decent- the crust was my favorite part. Overall, it didn't look that pretty (eye appeal is buy appeal, am I right?) and it was overly salty with the feta, pistachio sauce, and cured meat. It really needed some type of sweeter drizzle on top to compliment the salty flavor. Honestly, the food didn't impress me and I wouldn't run back here to eat at all unless they changed their menu.

I spent some time talking with a server and she let me know that they are still adding a lot to this place. She informed me that the outside area will have a stage for entertainment and string lights over top, giving it that cozy city vibe. Brendan and I also checked out the bowling alley- which is super cool and something I def. want to check out next time. Overall, we had a good time and were happy we visited the brewery. I just hope they alter the menu a bit."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I have such mixed emotions about whole foods. I first visited whole foods in February of this year.. In my opinion, it is a little overwhelming at first and here's why. Like most People in the US, I was brought up on all of the ""typical"" mainstream American food brands. So when I walked into this place and barely recognized any brands, it was slightly overwhelming. It took a little research and I still do some research on some products before making a trip. I recommend going online and checking their coupons before making a trip - I tried a bunch of new products that way. I have also googled ""best snacks at whole foods"" to get some more ideas of what to try. 

Now here's the sucky part- overall, whole foods is pretty overpriced. BUT I will say that it is not ENTIRELY their fault. They sell higher quality products than your average grocery store. Mostly all of their products are made with the best ingredients and are often organic and gmo free. They are vegan and vegetarian friendly and have tons of options for people with allergies. If companies are spending more money on better ingredients , they are going to have to sell their products for a higher price. 

Having said that, tazo tea for $4 a box is not a sale. I went a couple weeks ago and saw the sale price advertised, did a quick google search and realized target sells their tazo tea for $3.50 NOT on sale. Needless to say I took the trip down the street and saved myself some money for the tea. I also recently wanted to purchase kale chips that I heard so much about (brand is called brad's raw and the flavor was vampire killer)... Until I realized they were $9 for 2 oz ! You can get fresh kale for less than half the cost! 

Although whole foods can be expensive they aren't ALWAYS that bad. My favorite yogurt, wallaby organic yogurt, is sold here. On a normal day, it cost $1 each. A couple days ago, they were 89 cents each- not bad for organic yogurt. They also have an amazing selection of uniquely flavored chocolates and they are pretty reasonably priced. Justin's organic peanut butter cups are incredible! 

The customer service has  always been awesome in this particular location. I hear that whole foods is very willing to take back anything that you don't enjoy , as long as you have your receipt. 

as other yelpers have said- the parking sucks in this location, it's a nightmare. So keep that in mind before you visit. 

Overall, when I want to treat myself a little, I come to whole foods."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I was in need of an update review, as I have visited Penn Mac COUNTLESS times since I first reviewed. 

Penn Mac is where it's at with all things food and especially, Italian food. They have an incredible bulk section when you first walk in, where you can get nuts, dried fruits, grains, beans, etc. for a decent price. Most recently, I grabbed some ground flax and whole pecans, as I only needed a little bit of each for some recipes. If you make a left, you are taken into the most busy part of the shop on the weekends- the deli. Here you will find ALL of the cheeses you could ever want, and the best deli meats too. The folks behind the deli are really knowledgeable and have assisted me in finding the perfect cheese many times (I just try not to ask them too many questions when they are super busy). They sold a smoked hot pepper cheese around the holidays that was TO DIE FOR... if you see it, buy it. There's a freezer section back in this section as well, which is where you'll find frozen raviolis, other pastas, sauces, and pizza dough. I purchased their frozen pizza dough a month ago and we made pizza with it that weekend- it was excellent. So fresh, so tasty. I went back shortly after to buy some extras to keep in the freezer. If you walk straight back past the bulk section, you'll find all the spices you need. They sell everything from garam masala to onion powder in here. If you are looking for a special seasoning and don't feel like buying an entire large container of it, come here and check out their selection. I've purchased white pepper, jerk seasoning, and onion powder in little containers (all .99 cents each) and loved them! If you keep walking straight back, you'll find the bathroom before the stairs to the right (it's hard to find, so I figured I would point it out for you- you're welcome). If you're lucky, you'll also find wine back here that is available to sample. What's better than shopping in the strip on a Saturday morning and having a shot of red wine before 10:00 am? Answer: not much. If you walk to the right of the bulk section, you'll find the motherload of pastas, sauces, vinegars, oils, condiments, rices, all the goodies. Keep walking and you'll find fresh baked bread, home made pepperoni rolls, and their produce section. They also sell fresh pastas as well. 

I love this place, and come here almost every single time I'm in the Strip and definitely every time I am looking for a killer deli meat or cheese. Wonderful employees, wonderful food, wonderful experience every time!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"Finally had the opportunity to check this place out. I have been meaning to FOREVER, and when my parents received a gift card for Christmas and asked me to join them to check it out- I obviously had to say yes. They have valet parking, which is great. The restaurant is so cute and classy. It is just so charming and romantic- a perfect place for a really special date. Our server was awesome. I told him what I was looking for in a wine selection and he chose the perfect one (wish I could remember the name!) We started out with small salads and OMG. I didn't think a small salad before a meal could be so impressive. It was just so fresh and the dressing was so delicious. I wanted seconds and thirds, I loved it. We were given a bunch of toppings for the salad or bread, which was pretty cool. The bread was delicious and so were the oil and vinegars it was served with. The butter even seemed to be fancified in some way and was so tasty. Then, we were served pasta with vodka sauce. Now, their vodka sauce is just something special. It is so incredibly tasty. I really enjoyed it and practically licked the plate clean. Next, my meal, which was a medium well NY strip with some potatoes on the side. Honestly, my entree didn't blow me away. The steak was very good, but the potatoes were burnt. I mean, they were so crisp and oily, I could not enjoy them. The steak was a hefty portion but for the cost of the meal, I really was expecting a little more with this entree. Still, it was delicious and I enjoyed everything but the potatoes. For dessert, my mom and I split the raspberry tiramisu. OMG. Now, this.... BLEW me away. It was so unbelievable. Arguably, the best tiramisu I've ever tried in my life. I was in heaven while I consumed it. I highly recommend trying Alla Famiglia for yourself- it's a special experience. I do want to return, but I will just try another entree, as their menu changes almost daily. 

Side Notes:

-They will customize a menu for you. Example: my parents were celebrating their 25th anniversary with their friends here and they called before and asked if their menus could mention their anniversary. Without hesitation, they created custom menus for my parents and their friends.

-You can come here simply for drinks or desserts. Personally, I tend to feel awkward doing so in nicer restaurants, but the wait staff said that it's completely fine to do so, and that they will even save you a spot at the bar or a table if you call ahead. Knowing this, I really want to come back for some wine and tiramisu in the near future!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"Important to note: If you come on a Sunday, the menu is breakfast food (mainly) all day long. 

Yes, this is ideal if you're craving a breakfast sandwich at 8:30 pm, however I was a little bummed because I really wanted to try other items on the menu that were not available. However, we did try: 

- Roasted Brussels Sprouts $12
farro / pickled shallots / tarragon / apple / flax seed / smoked goat cheese
*This was really tasty. I ate the entire thing and it didn't fill me up though.. def something to consider along with something else if you're really hungry. The flavors all went so well together: the sweet apple, the smoky and tart goat cheese with the roasted brussels.. really well done.

- Diner Burger $15
Jubilee Hill Farms double patty / bacon / american cheese / mayonnaise / steak sauce / pickles / martin's potato roll
*My partner ordered this. He liked it, however he didn't feel that it was out of this world or stood out compared to other burgers he had. He did enjoy it though and the fries were SUPER flavorful and delicious. Brendan loved the pickles on this and the bun as well. 

- Fried Chicken Sandwich $14
thigh / broccoli cheddar / honey mustard / pickles / martin's potato roll
*This was really tasty. I didn't love that the sandwich was made with the thigh, as dark meat isn't my favorite. However, the chicken was really juicy and crispy and flavorful. I didn't quite understand why there was broccoli on this sandwich, however I appreciate the creativity. The pickles were INSANELY GOOD. It was obvious these are homemade, they tasted so fresh and were perfectly crunchy. The bun was super fresh and super delicious as well. I also loved the fries. Perfectly seasoned and fried to perfection. 

My regret is that I didn't order more beer during my visit. I only tried one, which I really loved, however I should have ordered small pours of multiple beers instead. This is the beer I tried:

- Stray Radiant - Sour Strawberry IPA - 6.8%. The description of the beer was: Huge ripe strawberry, tangerine, and vanilla aroma. Ripe fruit on the palate with moderate acidity and mild cereal grain sweetness. Medium-full body and creamy, supple mouthfeel. Tangy blended breakfast juice finish. Orange-tinted and well-hazed.
*This was really tasty. I enjoyed and savored every little bit of this. 

Overall, we had a really nice dinner here. The ambiance is really comfy. We loved the little booths and how they were raised up a bit. I definitely want to return to try their typical menu instead of the brunch menu and want to try more beers next time!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"It's SO disappointing when you are really looking forward to trying a place you've been meaning to go to for forever, you finally go, and then it's a bad experience. I reallllyyy wanted to like this place.

I grew up in Carrick, so anytime there's a new business in Carrick, Mt. Oliver, Allentown, etc., I want to go and support it. I want these areas to thrive, so I am all about supporting their small businesses. I was so excited to come here and was amazed when I walked in the door to see the black walls, gorgeous artwork on the left and decorations covering the place from head to toe. I enjoyed looking at all of their baked goods and was impressed that they carried so many gluten free and vegan options.

However, our experience from there was pretty disappointing. It took a good 3-4 minutes for someone to even notice we needed waited on. There was just no one behind the counter at all. When the barista did come out, he looked pretty miserable and barely spoke to us. I ordered the iced caramel latte and Brendan ordered a cold brew. Where they make the drinks is literally right in front where you pay, so it was hard not to notice how the drinks were being made. The cold brew was literally a splash of cold brew (I'm talking like an inch, max) and then a ton of ice and then he literally took a pitcher of water and then filled it with water. I understand that cold brew is a concentrate, I make it at home all of the time. However, I think that giving a customer a drink that is 75% water, 15% ice, and 10% coffee is pretty cheap. The cold brew didn't taste bad, but it tasted how you would expect- really watered down and weak. My drink was a similar experience. Tiny bit of coffee, caramel flavoring then a ton of whole milk. It just seemed cheap and strange to me to pour it like that right in front of us. I honestly feel if he had been a little nicer about it, like explaining ""Hey, our cold brew is a really strong concentrate so that's why I'm watering it down this much"" would have been considerate and we would have been more understanding. But instead we were left with no explanation whatsoever. The barista then asked for my card and put it in the iPad and then he just sat down to work on a computer, while I signed the iPad and took my card out. He couldn't just wait to walk away from the counter until we left? Again, unprofessional. 

Pittsburgh has a TON of awesome coffee shops. In fact, there are several amazing ones just down the Hill in Southside. Why would I want to come back to a place with miserable employees, mediocre coffee, and unprofessional work habits?  I'll pass."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"For my friend's birthday, we went to Benihana to celebrate. Honestly, the only time I have ever been to Benihana has been for birthdays. As many yelpers noted- their parking lot is VERY odd. Be prepared.

I wanted to try some items that I never had at Benihana before, so I decided I would be adventurous and try some sushi....vegetable sushi that is (I am not a seafood lover). The vegetable roll consisted of: green leaf, avocado, cucumber, tomato, red cabbage and yamagobo. I dipped it in some soy sauce and added a small dab of wasabi to each bite. I didn't love it- I think sushi just all around is not something that I enjoy the taste of. 

For my meal, I ordered the hibachi chicken. My boyfriend ordered the spicy hibachi chicken. The first course was soup. It was a light, chicken broth based mushroom and green onion soup and it was decent, nothing crazy or packed with flavor. The salad came shortly after- ice berg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced radishes and ginger dressing. I loved the dressing! I wasn't a fan of the mediocre choice of greens and vegetables though. 

The main portion of the Benihana/hibachi experience, is the show. Our chef was very nice and very talented. He recognized the birthday girl at our table and gave her a special chef's hat, haha. He prepared our vegetables, shrimp appetizer and main entrees in front of us. The vegetables consisted of zucchini and onions. I agree with other yelpers- the vegetables could be improved. The portion isn't very large and more variety could be added. Having said that, they were delicious. The shrimp was also very tasty. 

My entire table ordered the fried rice with their meal and I HIGHLY recommend doing so, rather than ordering the white rice. The fried rice is made fresh right in front of you and is very good! The yum-yum sauce, of course, is the icing on the cake... SO GOOD. It went perfectly with the rice, chicken, veggies and shrimp. My whole table asked for additional sauce to go and the staff was very friendly and super accommodating! The hibachi chicken was very good and came with sautéed mushrooms. I really enjoyed my boyfriend's spicy hibachi chicken- the sauce was wonderful.  

At the end of the meal, everyone had a choice of sorbet. I had the rainbow sorbet- it was the perfect ending to a delicious meal. The staff also took our picture and printed a copy for the birthday girl.

Benihana is not my favorite place to eat at all, but they are a great place to go for a birthday. The staff was wonderful, the food was good and we all had a great time. Oh and a side note- their Shirley temple's are awesome!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I had my eye on this place for a long time. Ever since Lauren Toyota (YouTube extraordinaire) posted a video about it being one of her favorite places to eat of all time, I knew I had to check it out. We came here for brunch on a Monday morning- there wasn't a wait at all, which was great. It's located in the Wynn, which is an overall gorgeous hotel. I just loved the bright, flowery decor. We opted to seat inside, although outdoor seating was available. We received excellent service here from the start to the finish. Brendan had a coffee and the eggs Benedict. I started with the fresh orange juice and the vegan key lime pie smoothie. For my meal, I had the vegan chicken & waffles, which is what my girl Lauren had when she visited. Although I am not vegan, I sincerely appreciate the food and prefer vegan options when they are available. The orange juice was good, but honestly it wasn't the best I've had. It wasn't as sweet as I would have liked it to be. That was the only thing that was so-so about this experience. Brendan LOVED his eggs Benedict. He ate the entire thing without hesitation. He also loved his order of potatoes that came with it. The key lime pie smoothie was unbelievable. It tasted like a key lime pie- tart and sweet and smooth. There were avocados in it, agave, key limes, among other simple ingredients. The vegan chicken & waffles.. OMG. I am drooling just thinking about it. They presented it to me with two types of syrup- a hot one and a regular one. I liked both and kind of mixed them together to create a mild syrup. They also gave me vegan butter as well. The waffles were just as waffles should be. There were little scallions inside, which complemented the savory flavors in the dish. They were fluffy but not falling apart and were just so tasty. The ""chicken"" was unbelievable. It was juicy and so tasty- you never would be able to tell it wasn't real chicken. The breading stayed on and didn't fall off the ""chicken"" at all. It was just so tasty, I loved it. This place was just overall really impressive. It was gorgeous, service was great and the food was spot-on. Not to mention, they are incredibly vegan friendly- they offer you a vegan menu as soon as you sit down and the prices are no different than the meat options (often it's the opposite in many restaurants). My meal was $20 and it was WELL worth it. Brendan and I both agreed this was the best place we ate in Vegas. We were both in love with this place and I would LOVE to stay at the Wynn the next time I visit and eat here for breakfast every single day (no lie). Keep doing what you're doing, Terrace Pointe Cafe, because you are doing it right!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I knew alllll about this place for MONTHS before finally trying it. When my mom mentioned she wanted to have tacos on Mother's Day (awesome, right?!) I knew we HAD to come here.

First thing is first- this is a popular joint. Be prepared. Call before you plan on coming and they will add your name to the list. When I called, there was an hour wait. By the time I actually got there, I only waited 10 minutes... pretty amazing. Second- I walked past this place at least 10 times in the past 4 months without knowing it was there...as other yelpers have stated (and thank you fellow yelpers for writing it in your reviews- don't know how I would have found it without you!), it's located directly left of the Row House Cinema. There was a teeny tiny menu hanging on the door and that was literally it. Once you walk in though.. you know exactly where you are. The bbq smokey smell smacks you in the face in such a pleasant way (lol). Third- CASH ONLY- bring some mula with you! Forth- BYOB! How amazing is that? What's REALLY cool, too, is that Atlas Bottle Shop is two doors down- directly to the right of Row House Cinema. I stopped there while I was waiting for my table, picked up a 6 pack, asked them to chill two of my beers and my mom and I were able to enjoy some delicious cold brews at our table. So awesome!

Now for the best part, of course.... The food! I ordered the chicken and apple taco with smoked jalapeno mayo, my dad ordered the brisket taco and my mom ordered the chicken taco without the hot sauce (she doesn't like spicy things). WOW. I just LOVED the chicken and apple taco. The smoked jalapeno mayo was amazing- it definitely had a smokey flavor and a really nice kick to it... sooo good. My mom loved her chicken taco as well. My dad literally took one bite of the brisket taco and ordered another... he loved it! 

We also ordered three sides- jalapeno apple coleslaw, smoked red cabbage and mac and cheese. The jalapeno coleslaw was very good, but it didn't blow me away. On the other hand... the smoked red cabbage did. It was my mom's idea to order it, I'm not too much of a red cabbage fan. Well, this changed things for me. It had a district smokey taste to it and was PACKED with flavor. There were thick chunks of bacon in it that took the cabbage to a whole new level. SO good. And the mac and cheese... do I really need to say? It was some of the best mac and cheese I have ever had. The garlic was pungent, which I really liked.  It was creamy, super cheesy and had a crunchy top. Perfect.

On top of all of that... the service was great too. My mom and dad LOVED it here and already planning their next trip. I loved it as well and CANNOT wait to return."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I visited Cinderlands for the 2nd time and thought I should update my review! We visited on a Sunday evening around 6:00 pm- it wasn't too busy at the time and we found a table easily. Last time I visited, I was a little disappointed that I didn't try more beers, so I made a point to try more this time! First and foremost, the descriptions for the beers are ON POINT. They perfectly describe the flavors of the beer and the magic that happens in your mouth. Although they don't have a large selection of beer, I am totally ok with that at a brewery, because they are actually making these beers from scratch. I was also personally excited to see they had two sours on tap, as sour beers are my current FAV. Here are the beers I tried:

Grizzled Canary: Lemony aroma with a sour and slightly sweet taste and a hint of herb in the back of your tongue. REALLY good. 4/5
Bog Whipper: Carbonated orange citrus goodness. Deliciously sour. 3.5/5
Midnight Ramble: Literally tastes like a dark chocolate and raspberry chocolate bar. Dark tartness and the raspberry is there at the end. Full bodied and robust. 4/5

I loved the beer. For food, the boyfriend went with the spicy fried chicken sandwich (bleu cheese dressing / iceberg lettuce / pickles / martin's potato roll / $14) without the blue cheese dressing. I went with the winter salad (radicchio / belgian endive / fennel / red onion / cara cara orange / quince sherry mustard vinaigrette / $8) and the ""sweet potato"" (parmesan tempura / muhamarra / aleppo sumac honey / pickled chiles / cilantro / mint / $12) which was basically steamed sweet potato that was then fried (so it was super soft on the inside and crispy on the outside), served with a spicy indian-like sauce, herbs, and drizzled with honey. The sweet potato dish was absolutely delicious, but it is really spicy, so be cautious when ordering! The winter salad was not very good- it was entirely too bitter. All of the veggies are essentially pretty bitter on their own and the dressing didn't really take any bitterness away. The cara cara orange was also pretty bitter. I wouldn't order that again. Bren liked his sandwich a lot, but wasn't a fan of the seasoning on the fries. 

Later in the evening, we met up with a group of friends here and I tried the spent grain chicharrones ($7) which are crispy and thin and I think it's so cool they make them with grains from their beer brewing process. What a cool way to re-purpose the grains! They were delicious and the beer cheese they were served with was good as well.

Overall, I had a great time at Cinderlands. I really want to come back and try more beers- especially when they do another collaboration with the Pittsburgh Juice Company!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"Visited Kaya for brunch for the first time on Sunday and was so excited! I have been meaning to come here for a while and I'm glad we decided to check it out! 

I left my place around 11:00, called Kaya and they put me in for a reservation for 11:45. Parking in the strip can be a major PAIN, so this worked out perfectly. I was disappointed to see that chicken and waffles were NOT on the menu! Apparently the waffle maker has been broken for a couple of weeks and they are waiting for the new one to come in. I was super disappointed because after reading reviews on yelp, I knew I had to try the chicken and waffles. After grieving for about a minute (lol), I started looking at the menu and decided on the ""huevos rancheros"" (spelling?). I asked for extra potatoes in place of black beans, which our server said wasn't a problem at all!

OMG. A grilled tortilla, three large pieces of peppered bacon, a heavy portion of fried potatoes with sautéed red onions and peppers, grilled pineapple, scrambled egg whites with salsa verde and guacamole. A perfect breakfast combo in my opinion! It was amazing! Packed with flavor- I LOVED the eggs with the salsa verde and the bacon was unbelievable. The guacamole tasted almost exactly like mine =]. I was a little disappointed in the grilled pineapple- I was expecting pineapple rings, not small chunks... but it was tasty none the less. My boyfriend ordered their breakfast burrito with waffle fries. He was given a breakfast burrito with hash browns- a little annoying, but he didn't mind. He loved his burrito. 

As we were eating, we couldn't help but observe the plates of a table next to us. It appeared as if most of the patrons had ordered the kaya burger and we could NOT believe how HUGE it was for only $11. I couldn't believe that mine was around that price as well- the portion was huge! I couldn't even finish all of the potatoes. Our meals and three non-alcoholic drinks totaled to $30, which was really reasonable for the quality we received! We were super impressed and can't wait to come back ESPECIALLY when the waffle maker is up and running!

One thing that disappointed us was the service. It was extremely slow at times and we almost felt as if we weren't viewed as important as the large table of patrons at the table next to us. You know it's a bad sign when you have to leave your card on the table for an extended period of time. Especially when your table is directly by the kitchen entrance and your server walked past about 5-7 times before noticing. Our server was very friendly, don't get me wrong, we were just disappointed in the amount of time it took to get our check. 

None the less- we will be back! I can't WAIT to check out their happy hour!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I heard from a friend that this place was the best BBQ joint in the burgh- so of course, I had to try it. When I looked at the menu online I noticed how insanely expensive everything was so I waited it out.. And what do you know? They went on groupon! Woo! 

We came here around 8pm on a Thursday night, the place was not very busy. The have four rather long picnic style tables that fill the dinning area on the first floor- pretty awesome and set the mood for some BBQ. There were also minimal decorations and no tv in sight- which I loved, the boyfriend did not. There was a party going on upstairs and the staff seemed pretty busy running up and down the stairs. 

We were served water and it took about eight minutes before a server came to the table. I ordered the heirloom tomato salad, coleslaw, Mac and cheese and half a rack of ribs. The boyfriend got baked beans, potato salad and their brisket sandwich. We waited 30 minutes for the food. Having said that- they seemed very busy with the upstairs party and short staffed. 

The food was delicious! I loved the coleslaw- slightly vinegary but with just the right amount of sweetness and there were little red onions in it (I love red onions). 

The Mac and cheese wasn't anything spectacular but it was pretty awesome as well- cheesy gooey goodness! 

The heirloom tomato salad was pretty good- cucumbers, fresh herbs, red onions and yellow, green and red heirlooms.. Nothing special but refreshing amongst all of the starches and fatty foods that were in front of me haha. 
The ribs had a crust on them like I have never seen before- which I loved.. But they did not fall apart in the way that I had hoped they would. My boyfriend said they were the best ribs he has ever had- I think they were average (especially after experiencing cowboy BBQ at rib fest this past weekend). 

The baked beans were very different. I honestly can't decide if I love them or not. They had such a unique smoky type flavor that I never had in baked beans before. Again, the boyfriend said they were the best baked beans he has ever had. 

The potato salad was good- mustard based with small scallions and dill. Nothing super crazy. 

The beef brisket sandwich was amazing- mustard, red onions and brisket- but that's all that was necessary. My boyfriend added coleslaw to the sandwich which was super tasty too! 

Overall, minus one star for the overpriced menu ($27 for $40 worth of food- the groupon was the way to go)! And minus one star for the longer wait for food. It was absolutely not the staffs fault - they were running around like crazy (the staff was awesome and very friendly). Despite not receiving 5 stars I would still return- with maybe more people to split the food. We didn't finish any of the sides and definitely  could have split them with more people. Overall- good experience :)."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"When I first came to Studio AM two weeks ago, they weren't on yelp! I was super excited to see they are on it now!

This place is AMAZING. In every single possible way! 

Studio AM is Baron Batch's studio, along with his crew. Baron creates incredible and unique artwork and John Malecki creates beautifully crafted furniture. This is their studio and work place, first and foremost. Every Sunday (or the Sundays they are available to do so), they host brunch! The hours are from 11-3 and it is currently RSVP only. You can check out their site to see how to rsvp, I did so by e-mail.

My boyfriend and I were incredibly excited about this brunch! We rsvped for 11 am and each paid $20 up front, for the brunch. Every single person who worked there was friendly, welcoming and made me feel right at home! The setting is not like a restaurant and is not meant. There are plenty of places to sit, but it is in a casual way, with sofas and some bar style seating. There aren't ""servers"" here, it's the crew of Studio AM, that casually walk around and take any orders that you have. There is also a buffet that consists of fresh fruit and various brunch items. When I went, there was a fruit salad, green beans with mushrooms, scalloped potatoes, smoked bacon and chicken stuffed with tomatoes and goat cheese. Everything was so good! I went up for seconds and had more green beans, bacon, fruit and potatoes. Everything was packed with flavor. They also had coffee, orange juice, cranberry juice and bloody mary mix for your taking, too. It's BYOB, so you can bring your own vodka for the bloody mary mix!

Besides the buffet, you can order off of their menu. My boyfriend and I tried a couple things. We asked John what he recommended and he told us that we HAD to try the French toast. I didn't want to order the same thing as my boyfriend, so I ordered chocolate banana pancakes. OMG! The French toast was literally the best I have ever had! It was so good... the drizzle on top made the dish completely. My pancakes were amazing as well, there was even melted chocolate chips on top! Mhm! Before leaving, I also ordered their breakfast club which was incredible! The garlic aioli just took it to a whole different level of amazing. 

Chef Steve is the one behind all of the magic! He was so friendly, shared a few tips with me on how to improve my French toast abilities AND he even took us to the basement to show us how they smoke their bacon and other meat, after my boyfriend asked him how they do it! How amazing is that?!

Baron was painting on canvas during the entire brunch. He was approachable, super friendly and even let us hang out at his work table to watch him paint. What an awesome experience! Everyone there was so laid back.

I plan on coming back and bringing my friends and family. This was honestly one of the absolute coolest experiences I have ever had. The food was amazing, the art is amazing, the people are amazing.. it's just all around an amazing time and I CANNOT recommend checking out Studio AM RIGHT NOW, any more!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I have visited Marty's Market on and off for the past year or so. If I ever want a unique and delicious sausage- this is where I go. Their selection changes often, but is always unique and delicious. Last time I purchased, I ordered an Asian inspired sausage with pork, cilantro, and other Asian flavors, as well as the ""thanksgiving"" sausage that consisted of turkey, potatoes, some fresh herbs, carrots and gravy. The thanksgiving one was insanely delicious, the Asian one was as well. The market itself isn't very large. That being said, they have all of the staples you might need (bread, eggs, pasta, etc) and a decent produce selection, most of which is organic. Most recently, I purchased a container of fresh organic alfalfa sprouts- at $2.50 it wasn't a bad price. They have tons of items that are local- from pretzels, pickles to ice cream. The market is definitely worth checking out.

Yesterday was the first time that I visited the café. There were 9 of us and I called about an hour ahead to reserve a table. They are on the ""no wait"" app, which made the process very easy. Service was good. Nothing super memorable but it was a positive experience and she separated our checks like a pro. I ordered two of the alcoholic beverages- the Pomegranate Peach Bellini and the Marty's Bloody Mary. The Pomegranate Peach Bellini was light, refreshing and delicious. The Marty's Bloody Mary was very good as well- although the beef stick was a little too chewy for me. It was a nice addition to the drink, though. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time and all of our orders were correct (which is always a good thing with a big party of people). I ordered the French toast sandwich. I knew from reading the description that it wasn't going to be actual French toast, but I was hoping it was going to have something a little more special about it. It was not very big, but it was filling. The bacon was really good- clearly fresh and it had an awesome flavor to it. The caramelized onions were weird. It seemed like they were either from some type of jar or were caramelized a few days before.. just didn't sit right or really go with the other flavors. The maple aioli was very good, although I do wish that the maple/cinnamon/sugar flavors were more present overall. Although this sandwich wasn't bad, I wouldn't order it if I visited again. I did try three other dishes that my friends had (one perk of going with a large group). The biscuits & gravy were tasty- the biscuit was crispy yet fluffy and the gravy had a delicious homemade taste to it. My friend loved it. The crab cake was really good- the apple, cucumber & pomegranates really added something unique to the dish & the crab cake tasted fresh. The shrimp & grits was incredible- I think that will be what I get next time. My boyfriend got the chicken sandwich and wasn't really impressed. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals. 

Overall, we had a positive experience and I would definitely return (for groceries and for a meal). 

*They validate parking (up to 2 hours) in the garage above the market!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"We were so obsessed with Smoke that we HAD to go back again for Father's day. This time, we brought the boyf's mom and dad as well. This experience- was a lot different than the first, unfortunately.

We started off with their queso- I had heard it was amazing and was super excited to try it. It definetly was a big bowl of cheese- the portion was pretty big and was enough to share with a larger group of people. But the flavor.. was lacking immensely. The cheese dip was almost completely flavorless besides the peppers and cilantro that were scarce throughout the dip. I took the leftover dip home and even doctoring it up didn't add much to it.. needless to say, I was very disappointed. The chips were homemade, which I greatly appreciated, but were also flavorless. My boyfriend's mom loved them though, so I gave her the remaining chips to take home.

One thing I don't like about this place that I didn't notice last time- they really don't have many drinks at all. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE that they are BYOB- it's completely awesome! But I didn't even think about their selection of non-alcoholic drinks. If I am not drinking alcohol at a restaurant, it's water for me, all of the time. But my boyfriend's parents always get pop and were a little disappointed that there were none available. They ordered their homemade lemonade and enjoyed it- but I do agree that some soda should be offered- even if it's only in glass bottle form. 

Our entire party ordered 4 orders of mac & cheese and almost everyone ordered a taco. I ordered the chicken and apple taco that I loved so much the first time I had it (I had been dreaming about that taco ever since). My boyfriend ordered that as well. My boyfriend loved his- I was disappointed in mine. It was drenched in the smoked jalapeno mayo. To the point where it was a little difficult to eat. The mayo is delicious, don't get me wrong... but sometimes too much of a good thing, makes it not so good anymore. It took away the other flavors and just overpowered the entire taco. The mac & cheese was different this time too! It wasn't as flavorful as it was the last time. My sister (who admittedly is a picky eater) had a couple bites and couldn't eat any more. My dad enjoyed his. The one thing I will say is the portion of the mac & cheese is awesome- and I love the crumb filled top. My mom and dad had to doctor up their mac & cheese leftovers by adding a lot more flavor, since it lacked so much in that department. I did the same thing with my leftovers, which made the mac & cheese bearable. My boyfriend's family liked their food, but weren't blown away either.

I do not want to give this place 3 stars, but I have to. The fact that the two experiences at Smoke were so drastically different is super disappointing. The food should be consistent- not different each time you go. 

I would like to return again, but I won't be running there anytime soon. Their desserts sound incredible and I have been too full each time I had visited to try any- so maybe dinner elsewhere and a drink and dessert at Smoke will be my next trip."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"Easter Sunday and my boyfriend takes me on a surprise brunch date. I was ECSTATIC when I realized we were going to Zenith. I have driven past this place, literally hundreds of times and probably every single time said ""I really want to go there!""

We waited in line for a minute and chose to seat with another group in order to be seated more quickly. No problem at all. We grabbed ourselves a coffee to start, had some water, ordered an iced tea and our entrees and headed over to the buffet. It was unbelievable how much food was there. With the $11.50 purchase you receive: a drink, the buffet and an entree. How cheap is that?! Here's a list of some of the items I had at the buffet and a description of how delicious they were:

Peanut Noodles- this was most definitely my favorite item on the buffet by far. The cold noodles were so tasty and I couldn't stop eating them. SO DELICIOUS.
Macaroni Salad- reallllllly good. 
Potatoes with a chimichurri sauce- SO GOOD
Broccoli with mushrooms- so good. the broccoli was crunchy and the mushrooms were juicy and packed with flavor
Veggie Orzo salad- YUM. Again, packed with flavor
Fruit salad- fresh and tasty
Spinach & Strawberry Salad- Amazing. 

Do you see a pattern here? Everything was incredible. It was all cold items, and all packed with flavor. I wasn't sure how my carnivorous boyfriend would react to this place, but he and I agreed on every item we tried. In addition to the cold salads at the buffet, they had different bread options, as well as a desert table with pies and tons of cakes. I tried a lemon mint rum pound cake, strawberry vanilla pound cake and a chocolate almond one. ALL of them were so delicious. 

Was that all we ate? Of course not. In addition to the incredible buffet, you get to pick an entree. The list of options weren't too big, about 8 options. I went with the vegan lemon pancakes with strawberry topping. My boyfriend went with the vegan bbq seitan sandwich. I really enjoyed my pancakes- they were SO tasty and moist and just insanely delicious. My boyfriend wasn't as crazy with his sandwich- he ate it and liked it but thought it was a little dry. Both of our meals came with a curried rice, which actually wasn't super good, but it didn't matter, because there were SO many buffet items to compensate for it. 

The most random insanely delicious item we had there? The ICED TEA. It was literally the best iced tea I have ever had. It was just black iced tea, but it was so tasty and bolder than other teas I've had. We were sad we couldn't take a pitcher home with us.

In addition to the food, I LOVED this place because of the experience of it. Chairs and other decor hanging above your head while you eat, different colored rugs on the floor, pictures and other items all over the walls- it was so entertaining to look at everything. After I ate, I walked around the store for a bit to look at the clothes, shoes, jewelry and everything else they had to offer. 

Basically, I'm obsessed with this place. The service was great, the food was unbelievable, the atmosphere was so fun... I am anxiously anticipating when I can return again! :)"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I've lived 5 minutes from Southside all of my life. I must have walked/ drove past this place at least one thousand times and finally had the opportunity to check it out! My friend had a living social for Ibiza, allowing me to try it out as well! 

The first thing I noticed was how gorgeous this place is. It's dim in the dining area and beautifully decorated. It takes you out of Pittsburgh for your time there and into a whole different world. 

Before I even mention the food, let me rave about our server. Unfortunately, I do recall her name, but WOW.. she KNEW her stuff. She described to us the wines on special and about 5 of the special dinners. I was impressed by how much she had memorized in regards to the specials. She was fantastic the entire evening and so were the other staff members as well. All around, perfect service.

We were given white bread with an herb and lemon butter upon our arrival to our table. The butter was delicious and so was the bread. Nothing completely out of the ordinary but it was very tasty.

Next- drinks! As the name states, Ibiza is a wine bar. Being a wine LOVER, I knew I had to try some of their selection! They have a variety of wine flights. Now, I adore going to breweries and am very familar with beer flights, but have never seen wine flights offered. Of course, I had to get one. I chose the South American Flight- $18. It was the only flight that offered 5 wines and I wanted to try a bunch! The flight came with a little bit of everything- rose colored, white and red wine, dry and sweet wines- each one was unique and different from the next. My two favorites were the Cros Rose Malbec and the Santa Carolina Chardonnay. The chardonnay was AMAZING and I am usually not a fan of chardonnay at all. 

When it came to ordering our meals, we decided to split multiple tapas. We chose two items from the section of the menu entitled, ""Tapas Caliente"" (hot tapas) which were: ""Al cachofas empanadas con ajo y aceite de oliva"" (artichoke fritters with garlic and olive oil) and ""Gambas al ajillo con pimenton, tomate y salsa picante"" (spicy shrimp with garlic, paprika, tomato and hot sauce). We also ordered an item from the ""Pasta"" section of the menu, ""Gnocchi con salsa albahaca e pinones"" (gnocchi with pesto sauce). 

I'll start with the artichokes- amazing. We received 4 in the order and a small garnish of spring greens were presented in the center. They were delicious- breaded and fried to perfection- not greasy or heavy. The sauce was incredible. I liked it so much, I ate the spring green garnish :x! Yummy!

The shrimp was also incredible. Large, fresh shrimp marinated in a sweet but spicy sauce. There were small garnishes of peppers and a fresh lemon on the plate as well. The shrimp was absolutely my favorite dish- it was made perfectly.

The gnocchi was also, incredible! The pesto sauce was sweet, slightly citrus tasting and very creamy. The gnocchi was filling, but not too heavy. So good!

Even with our living social discount, the bill was about $70. The high prices are the reason why I knocked off a star. Since most dishes are tapas and are small portions, I think the prices could be adjusted slightly. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my time at Ibiza and would love to return when I need a little escape."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"When visiting Ikea, know what to expect.

Don't expect the customer service to be fantastic. Don't expect that the item you have in mind will be in stock. Don't expect to be able to call them without being on the phone for at least 30 minutes. 

Expect it to be crowded. Expect to wait a while for help in the department you might have questions in. 

Take this place with a grain of salt.. that's the expression, right? 

Ikea is a great place to get affordable & nice looking furniture. Don't expect the instructions on how to build said furniture to be in English & or to even have the parts labeled. Expect it to be a hassle- but that's why you got a $60 tv unit that would cost $200 somewhere else.

Also- Expect the weekends to be a mad house. Expect to drive around the parking lot searching for a spot. Expect the store to be incredibly crowded. If you expect these things going in, you might not be disappointed. 

Since moving in to my new place, I have been to Ikea probably 10 times this year. I have learned to visit during weekdays & to check online (if I have something specific in mind) to see if that item is available BEFORE I visit. Trust me.. driving all the way to Robinson to find out the tv unit you want is not in stock & won't be for another month & all you can do is be on the waiting list where they are supposed to text you/e-mail you to tell you when it's in stock but then don't, so you have to call them & be on the phone with them for 40 minutes during your lunch... it's not fun. Also, putting the furniture together without any proper instructions is also not fun.

Some awesome items I have bought from Ikea at AMAZING prices include: ice cream scoop, plastic bag holders for the wall, potato masher, French press & a lamp. Our tv unit was a good price too- even with the difficult assembly.

My issue with Ikea is their customer service. Like I previously mentioned, we visited around October with a particular TV unit in mind. I should have checked the availability of the item first, but I didn't. When I arrived, I saw it was out of stock & asked what my options were. We were told we could we placed on their waiting list- I would receive a text &/or e-mail when the item was in stock. A month went by, I never received the text or e-mail. I decided to check online to see if it was in stock in this location & it was. I do not live near Ikea & therefore, called them to make sure they could hold it for me, so that I wouldn't make the drive there for nothing. I was on hold for 40 minutes. Finally, they were able to confirm they would hold the item for me until the weekend, but didn't have an answer as to why I never received a text/e-mail like I should have when the item was in stock. I was given an order # and was told to go to the living room department to tell the employees my order #. I did just that- but when I informed the gentleman working that I was there to pick up an order that was being held for me, he looked at me like I was insane & stated, ""What do you meeaann an order?"" I replied that I had an order number & he all of a sudden knew what I was talking about. 

So expect all of these things & you won't be disappointed. It's a good place for cheap, affordable, decent looking furniture & other home items. I will visit again, but never without checking availability online & only during the weekdays."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I had my first experience with Open Streets Pittsburgh this past Sunday. The route was from Market Square to the North Shore to the West End. My friend & I biked from Southside- it was literally the most perfect weather to go bike riding, it was about 75 degrees, sunny with a breeze. I couldn't believe how many people were in Market Square! We arrived around 10:00 am which is when Yoga was starting- it was packed. I recommend arriving early to find a good spot. What I enjoy the most about Open Streets is that there is something for everyone. Don't want to go on the route to walk, run, or bike? There was plenty to keep you active and entertained in Market Square alone. After yoga, they had Zumba classes scheduled and other exercise classes as well. They also had plenty of vendors out- I had the opportunity to try Blume Honey Waters, which was awesome and refreshing. We took advantage of the full route and had a lot of fun riding through the neighborhoods. Although the streets are blocked off, there are some areas where cars still need to cross and the organizers/volunteers did a great job of slowing down the participants and letting the cars go. The West End Bridge was completely closed off, which was pretty awesome. Of course, we had to stop and have a photo session there- the view of the city from the West End Bridge is just gorgeous. There were plenty of water stations and other vendors as well. There was something going on in each neighborhood- vendors, water, bathrooms, and additional exercise classes. There were also plenty of activities for children to do along the way and The Children's Museum even had free admission!

Although I did enjoy my experience and plan to return again, there are some things to keep in mind:
- do not expect to have the opportunity to ride your bike fast on this route. There are just simply too many people. Trails are meant for that purpose. You will have to ride slow, and you will need to ride with great cautiousness, as some bikers were seen stopping in their tracks and we even saw another biker run into someone because they had stopping suddenly. That can be really dangerous. Also- there are a lot of children participating in this with their parents. So you will need to keep an eye out for little riders and be mindful of their presence. 
- people will be walking along the route and many of them will be in the middle of the road. If you are riding your bike, you will have to be mindful of them and will need to either go around them or beep so they can let you pass. Which brings me to my one complaint- I do think that the organizers should try to encourage walkers to walk on the far right side of the route. I think that for their safety and for the safety of all participants, it makes the most sense. It simply doesn't make sense for every biker to need to go around the walkers, when they have side walks available to them. For walkers with dogs or children, this is especially important, as you are putting your dog or child at risk of being run over by a biker by walking in the middle of the route.  It would be awesome if this could be reinforced- it really is a safety concern.

Overall, I had a good time and look forward to going again. I am interested in seeing what other neighborhoods will be featured and I'm really happy that this will be an ongoing event throughout the Summer."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I'm SO sad that this beautiful restaurant has closed.

I heard so many wonderful things about Dish and had been meaning to come here for months. For Christmas, I purchased a gift card for my mom, which we had planned to use in May, but had to rush to use when we learned that they would be closing their doors at the end of April. My parents and I came here on April 14th (Good Friday). I arrived at 4:30 pm without a reservation and there was a hefty line out of the door. We were able to find 3 seats at the bar when the doors opened at 5:00 pm. The bartender was outstanding- she worked independently and was able to make everyone's drinks at the bar, in addition to the people waiting for seats, in addition to taking everyone's food orders and keeping track of tabs, etc. It was truly amazing seeing how fast and efficient she was. My mom ordered their specialty drink which had citrus and thyme in it. We then both ordered mojito's which were delicious (arguably the best mojito I've ever had!). For an appetizer, we started off with the Gamberi-
Sautéed wild Gulf shrimp in extra virgin olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, crushed red pepper and parsley. WOW. The shrimp was so juicy and so tasty. Our bread was next- again, unbelievable. It was so fresh, and tasted so good dipped into the olive oil and vinegar, as well as the sauce that came with the shrimp. For our entrees, we ordered:

Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare- Spaghetti with scallops, mussels, New Zealand cockles clams, calamari and wild Gulf shrimp in white wine, extra virgin, garlic, parsley, tomatoes and crushed red pepper. (my dad ordered)

Rigatoni alla Scamorza- Rigatoni with smoked mozzarella, prosciutto, peas, roasted and salted pistachio nuts in a cream sauce with Reggiano, fresh ground black pepper and parsley. (my mom ordered)

Pappardelle ai Funghi- House made pappardelle with Portobello, shiitake and cremini mushrooms. Brussel's sprouts shallots, garlic and extra virgin. Reggiano and basil. (my entree)

Wow, wow, and wow. I was so impressed with all of the entrees. The amount of seafood that came with my dad's entree was incredible. He loved it and thought everything was so fresh. My mom's was my favorite out of all three- the rigatoni pasta was the most perfect al dente pasta I've ever had and the sauce was SO good. It was a heavier sauce so she couldn't finish the meal, but it made for some pretty tasty leftovers the next day. My entree was light, but PACKED with flavor. All of the mushrooms and the brussel's made it so tasty- it almost was like a classier version of haluski, meaning, I adored it. Of course, we had to order a desert as well. My co-worker insisted that I try the panna cotta, which we did. It was the first time I have ever had panna cotta and let me tell you- I was not disappointed. It was creamy, thick, and so delicious. It wasn't too sweet, which I really loved. 

While we were waiting for our entrees, the executive chef/ owner, Michele Savoia, came over to us, introduced himself, shook our hands, and talked about his restaurant. What a special experience. He literally noticed that we haven't been there before and made an effort to introduce himself and thank us for coming. How genuine and thoughtful. He described that this restaurant is closing as a way to give himself a break, and that he is confident he will return to the Pittsburgh restaurant world someday. I am hopeful that is true, because if so, I will be first in line at the new spot. This place was incredible."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I never thought I would write a review for Walmart, because frankly- I avoid shopping there like the plague. I found myself having to go there to pick up an order my mom and I had placed for fried chicken, for a surprise party we were throwing for my dad. We ordered 200 pieces of fried chicken with Walmart, after checking prices with multiple other catering companies. Before calling Walmart to order the chicken, we checked online for prices. We found a PDF of the deli/catering menu and saw a ""party pack"" for 100 pc. Fried chicken for $58.98. When calling Walmart, they told us their price for 100 pcs of fried chicken was $70. We explained to them that the prices online were different and asked if we could receive the cheaper price that we had found online. The woman we spoke to did not act like this was a problem and told us to bring in a copy of the ""Party pack"" deal that we saw online.

Saturday afternoon rules around and I am the lucky one that has to retrieve the chicken from Walmart. My gut feeling told me that this wasn't going to be an easy task- I knew something would go wrong. Sure enough, I was right. The chicken was ready on time, which was the only positive from the experience. Before giving us the sheet with the prices for the chicken, I verified with the woman that the price would be $58.98 for 100 pcs (about $118 total). She told me that the price was $75 for 100 pieces. I explained to her what had happened when we placed the order and showed her the copy of the price online. She told me ""this isn't us"". I explained that it came directly from Walmart.com and I would be happy to pull the information up on my phone as well. She repeated to me ""No"" and ""This isn't us"" and even told me that I was wrong. What kind of customer service is that? She then proceeded to ask me what my mom's telephone number was, so that she could talk to her about the situation. I explained to her that we were having a surprise party for my dad and that she could not call her at that exact moment. It was clear that this woman did not care about me or my satisfaction with the order we placed. I wasn't getting anywhere with the conversation I was having with her, and therefore asked for her manager. Her first response was, ""I am the manager"", but after repeating myself, she went to look for her manager. This gentleman was also extremely unhelpful. He told me, ""This isn't us"" and did not explain what he meant by it. He also told me there was nothing he could do for us. I was so frustrated by this point in the conversation, that I told him I would not be returning because the customer service is atrocious.  

The chicken itself was fine, everyone enjoyed it at the party.

My mom visited a couple days later to discuss the situation with them, since she was the primary person who placed the order. She spoke to the same male manager that I had spoken to when picking up the order. He informed my mom that ""Walmart needs to update the PDF"" and that there was nothing he could do. At a MINIMUM, we should have been given a $10 gift card (the difference between the $70 for 100 pcs. We were quoted online, to the $75 it actually cost). Nothing. This billion dollar company could do absolutely nothing to accommodate their customers for their dissatisfaction in the service they received. 

I will never shop here again. Yes- they MIGHT have the cheapest options in terms of catering, but their customer service is terrible. It is not worth it whatsoever. Pay the extra money to be treated like a human being that matters."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"Considering Thai is my favorite food group (lol) I am on a mission to try all of the Thai that the Burgh has to offer. My mom is a Thai lover as well- so on a beautiful Fall Friday when I had the afternoon off work, we visited Noodlehead. There is some outside seating, but it was a little chilly so we sat indoors. 

Here are a couple things you need to know before visiting:
1. CASH ONLY
2. BYOB! (Only a 50 cents ""recycling"" fee per person)
3. Parking isn't the best- we paid to park at a meter outside of Noodlehead. There is residential parking but it's permit. 

Our server was nice & attentive to our table despite being very busy with a late lunch rush. She brought us glasses for our wine & a pitcher of water for the table shortly after our arrival. We ordered the pork belly steamed buns to start. I heard awesome things & had to try them. For our entrees, we ordered the chicken pad thai (spiciness at a 3), street noodles #1 (spiciness at a 3) with chicken & the beef soup (spiciness at a 1).

Pork belly steamed buns- I have always wanted to try these little adorable Thai sandwiches but wasn't sure where to find them before Noodlehead. They were good & very simple. Basically just BBQ pork in a steamed bun with some pickled cucumber on top. I added sriracha to mine to add some spicy flavor- they literally weren't spicy at all without it. At two per order for $6, there aren't a bad deal- just not as flavorful as I had hoped.

Street Noodles #1- The chicken was AWESOME in this. For $9, the portion of noodles I received was large & the amount of chicken I received was awesome as well. The chicken was fried but the batter was more fluffy than fried tasting. Really tasty. The noodles were disappointing. I understand that Fish Sauce is in A LOT of Thai. I'm not a fish person AT ALL, but I deal with it. In 99% of the Thai restaurants that I have been to, I can't taste the fish sauce in their food. Usually I can't even smell it. This dish was the exception. It had completely too much fish sauce in it. I tried to neutralize it by adding Sriracha- didn't work. I didn't eat much of this dish in the restaurant because I hoped I could ""doctor it up"" at home by adding sesame oil, soy sauce & chili oil, to make it less fishy. I couldn't even eat them then. I'm not sure if it was just a bad day or if these noodles are always this fishy but I wasn't impressed at all with this dish.

Beef Soup- My mom really liked this. I am not really a beef soup person, but the bite I tried was tasty. It had a slight spicy kick to it, which was nice. The portion was huge- what she didn't eat at the restaurant, she had for dinner the next day.

Chicken pad thai- Still fishy. Not as fishy as Street Noodles by ANY means, but it was still fishy. We added fresh lime juice & Sriracha & that seemed to do the trick of neutralizing the fish sauce. After adding those ingredients we really enjoyed it.

I don't want to give Noodlehead two stars- I love the décor of this place, it's rustic & modern, yet still Thai feeling, the presentation of the noodles were great & I am a fan of the prices & the fact that they are BYOB. But I can't give them a good rating considering two dishes we ordered were overpowered with fish sauce. If I have to take a dish home in order to make it better, then the restaurant didn't deliver like they should have. The pork belly steamed buns were also disappointing. I ended up ordering some to-go for the boyfriend & he thought they were bland as well.

I would be willing to return.. everyone seems to love this place, so maybe I just came on a bad day."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"My friend saw this place on Groupon & we knew we had to check it out. Anything with ""pints"" in the title intrigues me, haha. They also are new- only open a couple months, so we were excited to go. We went on a Monday night- found parking easily on the street & it wasn't very crowded inside. There were 5 of us & we found a spot easily on the second level of the restaurant. Our server was very nice & attentive to us the entire evening. Their draft list was decent in size- I went with a fruity IPA, it was delicious. They had beer cocktails, which was awesome. My friend ordered a beer that came with a smoked jalapeno inside (it was in the drink menu- the drink will be different depending on what porter they have on draft at the time). He loved it.

For appetizers we ordered the Spicy Sausage-Stuffed Apple, Spicy Chicken Nachos & Fried Pickle Chips. The Spicy Sausage-Stuffed Apple was our favorite. It was everything fall in a delicious appetizer. It wasn't too spicy but it was very flavorful & delicious. The Spicy Chicken Nachos were also a hit- they weren't super spicy but they were delicious. The fresh avocado on top was the perfect addition to the chips, chicken & cheese sauce with Pico. On their own, the chips were a little too salty, but overall we really liked this appetizer. The Fried Pickle Chips really weren't anything special. They were good- but not really memorable. My boyfriend & I weren't too crazy about the Guinness mustard that came with them- we enjoyed dipping them in ranch instead. 

Monday night is wing night- so three of us ordered some wings. For 50 cents each we couldn't pass up the chance to try some of their wing flavors! We ordered: 5 spicy dry rub, 5 hot pepper jam & 5 of the special that evening (honey spicy BBQ I believe?). The dry rub were good- definitely tasty. The hot pepper jam wings were a little disappointing. The jam didn't stick to the wings & therefore they were a little tasteless. They also weren't spicy at all- they were really sweet. The flavor that was on special that evening were the BEST. Super good.

For our sandwiches, our group ordered: the stuffed meatball burger, the city chicken sandwich, two grilled southwest chicken wraps and the roasted turkey club with house bacon.

My friend who ordered the stuff meatball burger LOVED it. Mozzarella cheese was literally dripping from the burger- it looked Awesome. I had the opportunity to try the city chicken sandwich (PORK for anyone who doesn't know what city chicken is)- it was definitely really yummy. It was also huge and my friend couldn't finish it. The two peeps that ordered the grilled southwest chicken wraps seemed to enjoy them as well. 

But I have to say that I ordered the best sandwich... the roasted turkey club with house candied bacon was IN-sane. It was HUGE. Thick slices of real turkey breast, thick slices of house candied delicious bacon LOADED high. This thing was a building basically. The flavor did not disappoint at all either. I was only able to eat 1/3 of it that evening. My boyfriend & I ended up splitting the remainder of the sandwich into two sandwiches & had that for dinner two days later.. so this one sandwich literally was 3 meals.. it's that big. 

One bummer about the sandwiches is that they all come with fries- they don't have other sides available. My friend did ask to switch her fries out for a salad- which was a $2 upcharge (not bad). The fries weren't super good- we ended up eating some for leftovers but then just throwing the rest out.

Overall this place was awesome- I would really like to return for the turkey club in the future, as well as a cold beer to go with it.

Check this place out asap!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"I needed to update my review, after coming to Lotus 4+ times in the past month. I am now officially OBSESSED with this place. 

Yes, Lotus is great for specific and hard to find Asian food items like dark soy sauce, sesame oil, chili paste and dumpling wrappers- but they are also great for other things as well.

Produce- Lotus has some of the freshest and cheapest produce around. You can't beat their prices on bok choy, and they have about 4-5 different types to choose from! Their scallions, peppers, eggplant and chives are also VERY affordable. I also love their selection of mushrooms- from shiitake to oyster to enoki mushrooms- they have it all. Their Japanese yams are WAY cheaper here than at Whole foods. They sell onions and lemons and limes individually, and they have thai basil which you can't find any where else! Chinese broccoli, snap/snow peas.. the list goes on and on and they are ALL affordable. They don't have a huge organic selection, but they do have some organic mushrooms. 

Spices- Lotus has AMAZING prices on spices. From whole fennel seeds to bay leaves to sesame seeds to whole cinnamon sticks- they have a pretty large selection throughout the entire store. Their cinnamon sticks are the cheapest I have ever seen- 5 of them for under $1.00. They sell fresh tumeric and fresh ginger here- again, wayyy cheaper than Whole Foods or Giant Eagle. They have fresh cilantro and again- their chives are VERY cheap and you get a TON of them in a package.  Even if you don't live Asian food, I would recommend coming here for the spices alone. You will be surprised. 

Kitchen supplies- Chopsticks, bamboo sticks, cheesecloth, wooden spatulas, strainers, bowls... they have SUCH an amazing selection of cheap but good quality kitchen supplies. I was looking for thick bamboo sticks for an appetizer I was making for Christmas and went on Amazon first to look. I found a pack of 100 for about $7. I thought that wasn't a bad price. I didn't purchase them, since I figured I would just check around at Lotus first and I found a pack of 100 for $.50.... 50 CENTS! Are you kidding? I couldn't believe it. I bought a little skimmer for taking fried foods out of hot oil- under $3 for a good sized one. I then went a block or two down to the kitchen store in the strip and saw the same size skimmer for over $20... insanity. 

Fun snacks- macadamia nut cookies- $2.50, little cookies that look like burgers and are insanely delicious and fun to eat- $2.00, pocky, gummy candy.. they have a great selection of unique and fun snacks. They are all VERY affordable too.

Other amazing items to try when you visit- the dark soy sauce is life changing. It's sweeter and more thicker than traditional soy sauce and is a real treat. They make their own tofu- it's the freshest around and is only 35 CENTS A BLOCK. It's unbelievably good, too. Their dumpling wrappers are in the freezer section and are under $2 for over 60 wrappers- SO cheap and SO easy to make delicious and fun food with them. They are a steal. You can't beat their prices for sushi rice ($2 for 1 lb.), sushi nori (about $2) and the mat to make the sushi with was under $2 as well. They have a great tea selection and if you are into seafood, they have a HUGE seafood selection. They have a great noodle selection and their ramen noodles are delicious. The one thing I was a little disappointed in is there selection of kimchi- they only had 1 kind to choose from the last couple of times that I visited.

This place is AMAZING and I highly suggest that you think about it not only when you are buying your specific Asian food items, but for your casual grocery shopping as well. You will not be disappointed."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"Wow. This place is amazing. As soon as Aj S. told me about this place, I KNEW I had to check it out ASAP! I finally had the chance to check it out and was blown away completely! First of all, I love that it is located in Braddock. Not only because it's an easy 15 minute drive from my house, but it's one of the many new businesses in Braddock that is helping to bring new light to the neighborhood. I was also excited to see that there was a parking lot as well- ALWAYS a plus!

I am absolutely in love with every single thing about this place. I love the atmosphere, the entire vibe you get when you walk in, the décor, the brick wall, the fact there was a dog just hanging out in the brewery, the idea of the bartenders wearing suits--it was all so unique and fun! 

They don't have a kitchen, but food trucks are there almost every single day. We went on an evening when the Pittsburgh Taco Truck was there- we just ordered them and took them right in the brewery, sat down and ate them before even ordering a beer (I didn't want the tacos affecting my taste buds while trying all of their beer for the first time, lol). What's so cool about this idea of food trucks- they have different food all of the time!! I checked out their site and saw that Blowfish BBQ often comes to The Brew Gentlemen, and sometimes they even have food truck round ups, where multiple food trucks come at one time. I am SO excited about coming back here to try more food trucks and drink AMAZING beer..

Now, about the beer... WOW. Every time I visit a brewery, or try multiple beers from the same brewery in general, there's typically always a few that I don't like and a few that I love. Every single beer that I tried at The Brew Gentlemen I LOVED. Here are the ones that were on tap when I visited that I had the opportunity to try: 
Overgrowth- this is one of their spring releases and I attended the day it was released officially. WOW. It was by far my favorite beer out of all of them. It basically tasted like a hoppy wheat ale and was PACKED with flavor. I had two samples of this one, it was the best! 5/5
Prototype 2- a blonde coffee ale. Let me start off by saying, I don't like coffee. The only way I will drink it is if it's iced and mixed with lots of sugar and cream. I LOVED this beer! It smelled and tasted like light coffee and was almost mocha tasting to me. It was so unique and just unbelievably good. 4.5/5
Nelson Saison Ale-  so refreshing and light yet packed with delicious flavor. There were hints of lemon and orange- perfect for summer! They had this in bottles, so I made sure to purchase one before I left! 5/5
White Sky- the chai wheat ale! I read tons of reviews about this one and could not wait to try this unique flavored beer! It did NOT disappoint! It was the PERFECT fall beer- perfect amount of spice and flavor. Super tasty and different. I really enjoyed it. 4.5/5
Build and Destroy- a really really dark wheat ale. What a crazy unique idea! Such a good flavor, this seemed to be my boyfriend's favorite. 4.5/5
General Braddock IPA- for an IPA, this was exceptionally smooth, the perfect combination of malt and hops. It was everything you could want in an IPA. 4.5/5

I loved that the screens above the bar not only displayed what beers they had on tap, but the glass it came in, what kind of beer it was and the percentage. It made choosing which beers I wanted to try super easy! The sample glasses were adorable, ranged from $2-2.50 a glass and each glass was 5 oz. Super reasonable!

The service was excellent, the beer was perfect, the bar is gorgeous... this place is awesome! I left with a bottle of beer to take home, two glasses and a t-shirt. 

I am in love with this place and cannot wait to come back!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"Boyfriend's birthday- trying to think of some place that will make him and his mom (who can be pretty picky) happy. I mentioned CBW and since it's been about 3 years since we last visited, we decided to check it out. It's a great place to take family who have never been there- the fact that it is a brewery in a church makes it a unique experience before you even order a drink or food item. Do not fret because it is in Lawrenceville- it's not in the hustle and bustle of Butler Street and they have their own parking lot. There is also straight parking available if need be. 

The church itself is huge and it's beautiful. I LOVE that they were able to save this building and use it in such a creative way. Upon arriving, you have a choice between sitting in the bar area or dining area. We chose the dining area, but did ask our server for the bar menu as well (the pizzas and sandwiches were listed only on this menu). Since it has been a while for me, I decided to order the sampler- which allowed me to try 6 different beers. One complaint is that their beer menu is a little confusing to read and the paper they place the beers on do not state each beer they have. Our server named off the beers she gave me, but by the time I made it to the seasonals, I could not remember the names of the beers. Next time, I know to drink the seasonals first, when the names have not disappeared from my brain. Not to mention, their samplers are expensive- $9-$10 for 6 little beers. Although, I do have to say that their beer was pretty decent! None of their regular brews were strong and they all were easy to drink. Although I appreciated those qualities, I would have appreciated a little more complexity in their taste. One of the seasonals I tried was their thunderhop, which REALLY impressed me. Anything with fruity notes and hops, I usually love and this one was no different! The flavors were perfect.

My boyfriend wanted the corn dog appetizer to start. Three huge, fresh corn dogs were presented to us- with a spicy ketchup and a honey mustard on the side. We really enjoyed them and could tell they were homemade by their quality. For our meals, I ordered the pierogi sauté (potato and cheese pierogis with garlic cream sauce, tomatoes, broccoli and fresh herbs), the boyf ordered a steak sandwich with fries and his mom ordered the traditional  appetizer size pierogi. My original choice was the Caribbean chicken wrap, so long as the chicken could be warm, instead of chilled. My server explained that could not be done- which led me to assume the wraps were premade, which turned me off. 

I was really impressed with my pierogis. The sauce was creamy and not overpowering with garlic, the pierogis were perfect and the broccoli and tomatoes were fresh and delicious. The fresh herbs brought all of the flavors together, making the entire dish absolutely delicious. The only odd thing was that the tomatoes were cold- which was a little offsetting. My boyf was not impressed with his steak sandwich and said it tasted like ""steak umms"". After looking at the steak, I would guess that he was right about that. He didn't hate it though and was able to eat it- but wouldn't order it again. His mom loved her traditional pierogis and raved about them the whole meal. 

Our waitress gave us two boxes for our meals and even wrote what our dishes were, CBW and the date on each box. I found that to be extremely awesome and helpful! 

Overall, I think this place is famous for their pierogis, pizzas and beer and I probably won't steer off of that path. Our service was great, the food was delicious and the beers were good- it was a very good experience.

PS--if you sign up for their e-mail mailing list, you get a free CBW pint glass! Pretty sweet deal!"
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"Three strikes, it's out for me.

The first time I came, I was with a big party and the wait for food was over 40 minutes. Since we were with a bigger party, I was completely understanding. The second time I visited, my boyfriend and I had dinner here. Again, longer wait, and I was a little annoyed at that point. However, when I saw a Facebook notification for their ""Jazzy Christmas Eve Brunch"", I thought it sounded wonderful and that we should give them one more try. I made our reservation for 1:00 pm, however, due to the nature of the busy Christmas holiday, I called around 11:00 am that morning to see if there was any possibility that we could arrive earlier. The woman on the phone was hesitant (although she did not explain why) but told us we could arrive at 12:15. We arrived a little early, as it literally only takes us around 6 minutes to drive here from our house. It wasn't that busy and we were sat right away and ordered our meals by 12:13. The jazz musician was wonderful- very friendly and he played wonderful music. Had it not been for him we wouldn't have been able to wait the 50 minutes it took for our food to come out. Again, the place wasn't that busy. I ordered a typical breakfast- two eggs, white toast, home fries, and turkey sausage. Brendan ordered the Eggs Benedict with home fries. We also both ordered drinks- Brendan had iced coffee (which tasted old) and I had a bloody mary (not bad- but nothing special at all- completely opposite of how the drink menu describes it). Now, it's not just the wait that is frustrating. If I had to wait 50 minutes for the best meal of my life, or close to it, ok. But waiting for 50 minutes for less than average food is a waste of time. The portion of home fries Brendan received was embarrassing- maybe 10 little pieces of fried potatoes. It looked like they were just dropped into a deep fryer, they were dry and there was no veggies like peppers or onions with them. The Eggs Benedict was even more embarrassing. I wish I had taken a photo, but frankly we were starving by the time our food came out and we were too disappointed in our experience to take a photo. The Eggs Benedict was served on English muffins- tiny piece of ham on each one, over done poached egg and barely any hollandaise sauce. It was the poorest excuse for Eggs Benedict that I have ever seen. My breakfast was below average as well- the white bread was so incredibly dry that I didn't even want to eat it, the home fries were bland and dry, the sausage was fine though and my over easy eggs were cooked correctly. We just wanted to get out of there, but I decided to talk to our server and inquire about the wait. The server was obviously disappointed in the establishment and informed me that this is a reoccurring problem. The kitchen here is too small to serve a large amount of people, yet the managers insist on booking many reservations. The result is incredibly long wait times on food and food not being prepared the way it should be. The server was great and attentive the entire time, as much as she could be, as she also had a table upstairs. Not one aspect of our below average experience has to do with the service we received. After paying, I decided to speak with a manager to express my disappointment in our visit. I talked about the 50 minute wait time, and the below average food. The manager was not surprised at the wait at all, and mentioned their small kitchen problem. I informed him that this should not be a reoccurring issue and should be taken as a learning experience for the restaurant. Especially on a holiday weekend, people should be warned about the long wait time before making a reservation or even being seated. Speaking to the manager did not change my feelings about this place at all. 

I really love the new business scene in Homestead and do my best to support these businesses as often as I can. However, I will not waste my time and come to Dorothy 6 again."
DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw,"My first trip to Ibiza was a great success, so when I saw this spot on Groupon again, I had to snag one! I took my mom & dad last Wednesday night- they had never been. We were sat right away. I told my mom allllll about the wine flights, so we decided to split one. We ordered ""Flight #2""- it was a white wine flight consisting of Salvemar Albarino, Ca'Donini Pinot Grigio, Santa Carolina Chardonnay & CK Mondavi Blonde 5. The chardonnay was my favorite last time & it was my favorite this time as well. We were pleased with the flight- $12 for 4 glasses of wine isn't bad. 

We were given bread to start. It was served with a VERY garlicy hummus. Dare I say it... the hummus was almost TOO garlicy for me & I NEVER say that about anything, I adore garlic. The bread was soft & delicious though. My mom ordered a Caesar salad without the anchovy's to start. She loved it- it was a decent portion & the dressing was light & the salad was fresh. 

One thing to note- there's a new menu. Only a couple weeks old. I wasn't prepared... I had just looked online & their old menu was still listed, so I had no idea what to order with the new menu. Our server was patient & helpful while I decided. We went with four items: the chicken spring roll, flat bread (with ham & pear), crab cakes & the garlic shrimp. As we waited, more people arrived & it was then that I noticed there was only one server working for all of the tables. I'm not sure if there was a call off or that is how they scheduled it, but it was obviously she was busy. There was also a bartender working, but for some reason she wasn't taking tables (although the bar was empty). 

Our food didn't take long, but it also did not arrive correctly the first time. The flatbread & chicken spring roll arrived, along with the crab cakes. We were also given spicy potatoes. I told our server that we didn't order the potatoes & she took them back without a problem & brought us the shrimp.

The flatbread- Unique, I had never had pears on a flatbread before. It was tasty- my mom & dad enjoyed it, but it didn't blow any of us away. 

The chicken spring roll- probably my favorite item of the evening. I wasn't too fond of the way it was cut- it wasn't practical for dipping, but it was really good. I wish they provided us with more chili sauce than the soy sauce though. The soy sauce on it's own was way too salty for the spring roll.

Crab cakes- I ordered these primarily for my dad. I don't really eat crab, but I decided that I should try them anyway. They were really good. The sauce that came with them went well with it. They weren't fishy & they clearly had a lot of crab in them. My dad liked them too, but again he wasn't blown away.

The garlic shrimp- This item came late to our table. As soon as she sat the shrimp down my family & I could smell a fishy smell... not what fresh shrimp should smell like. Despite the smell, we each decided to try one. They were tasteless. Literally. Which is a shame because it was one of my favorite items last time I came. I am NOT one to send food back... literally I have no idea when I last did so, but I didn't want us to pay $12 for shrimp we hated. I told our server we didn't like the shrimp & she took it off our bill without any issues.

While we were eating, the table next to us was sat & about 5 minutes later, they told the hostess they were leaving, considering they hadn't been greeted yet & felt as if the server was too busy. This was uncomfortable for me- I felt bad for the server, but also was overall confused as to why no one else was helping her with the tables.

Overall, I can see why this place gets such mixed reviews. I came here the first time & adored this place. The second time I came my experience was very different. My parents & I agreed that we probably won't return any time soon. It's a beautiful place with an awesome concept, but I think the management needs to step it up so that this place is more consistent."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"This is a tale of two hikes. I don't really like the actual ""La Madre Springs"" part of the trail. From Willow Springs Picnic Area, you take Rocky Gap Road and then turn right onto more dirt road (though it's bouldered off to prevent vehicles). The scenery during this section is nice, but I guess it just doesn't feel like much of a hike when you're walking on dirt road. Also, parts of the road are covered in large, loose rock, which can make the gradual ascent slightly more difficult (and annoying). On the other hand, because you're walking on wide road, you can look up more and take in the scenery.

The real fun begins when you reach the dam. From there, you take a much smaller trail up the hillside. The path closely follows the stream and crosses it several times. Some minor scrambling might be involved. When we went last weekend, there were several wet spots. On the way down, we came across a guy that said it was icy just a week or so ago. So I guess mud is better than ice.

To be honest, I had no idea where I was going. I just kept following the trail. I was with two of my cousins and they were getting tired. Just as they wanted to turn around, I went a little bit farther and spotted the old miner's cabin. It was quite serendipitous timing. It would have been a shame to turn around without any real end point to the hike.

You can actually keep going past the cabin up to the mines. I knew my cousins were ready to turn around, though, and I figured I'd save myself a reason to do the hike again. I'd also like to return now that I have my 10-stop neutral density filter - so I can capture some of the stream's mini-waterfalls.

On the way back, we spotted some bighorn sheep on the mountainside near Rocky Gap Road. That was a nice way to cap off a good hike."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"While my brother and I were waiting for my Skydiving DVD to be created, we decided to get some food in Boulder City. I must say that I really like the area. It has that old town vibe and nice street dining.

At the recommendation of one of the Skydive Las Vegas crew and one of my skydive meetup group members, we headed for Milo's. It was a great choice.

I opted for the Sunday special, which was Lamb Shanks. My brother went with the Southwestern Vegetarian Wrap. He described it as having a nice peppery ranch sauce that was flavorful, while not overpowering the taste of the earthy vegetables. Also, the avocado in the wrap had a good texture i.e. not too mushy. He sounds like a better Yelper than me.

My Lamb Shank dish exceeded my expectations. I went with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing for my salad. It was very flavorful and the perfect amount of dressing for the salad size. The dish also came with a couple of bread sticks and some vinaigrette/EVOO for dipping. As for the lamb, it was perfectly cooked - tender on the inside and very tasty. I thought the wine sauce was a tad strong, but not bad by any stretch. It complemented the lamb and mashed potatoes very nicely.

For dessert, my brother decided to order the cheesecake. I had some of it and it was pretty good. Definitely a good way to end the meal.

Some of the reviews mention slow service. Our server was very attentive and friendly. I also like their credit card system. He brought it out to our table and swiped my card right there. It even has an automatic tip system. Having to forgo the math is always a plus.

Incidentally, they have a great beer selection. Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale anyone? Too bad they don't have anything on tap.

Great location. Great street dining. This place gets my approval."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"To be honest, I was a little disappointed with The Lion King. I still enjoyed it, but it is not in my list of favorite musicals or favorite shows on the strip.

The show itself is well put together. The sets didn't blow me away, but they are creatively designed and serve their purpose well. The costumes and puppets are outstanding with their vibrant and playful colors. They really hold your attention. The performers are fantastic. I was impressed by the vocal talent presented on stage. The main roles are all played with charm and charisma. Timon and Pumbaa are as funny as you would expect. Mufasa is fatherly. Scar is sinister. Simba is youthful. The orchestra and background singers are also top notch.

My main disappointments are with the music and the overall emotion of the story. Outside of the main songs for which the film is known, the compositions fall a little short. Even the film's big hits don't quite hit. (Though I must admit, I currently have ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"" stuck in my head). The highlight for me was the opening ""Circle Of Life"" performance and the various African ensembles. They really capture the heart and soul of the setting.

As for the emotion of the story, it's just difficult to recreate what the film does so well. A great example is when Simba looks in the water and sees his reflection. That is an incredibly powerful scene that doesn't work as well on stage. It might be unfair to compare the musical to the film, but that is the perspective I'm coming from.

Having said all that, I've decided to give The Lion King four stars. The overall show is definitely worthy of more than three. I should also mention that I did not pay for tickets; I used houseseats. (I actually signed up for houseseats specifically because I heard tickets for The Lion King showed up last month)."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"So I guess I'll be the villain and be the first person to not give this place five stars. I take the star system literally. I'm definitely a fan of Rex and his new establishment. I just don't know if it's as good as it gets.

At RnR Wine Thursday night, Misti or Thao came up with the idea to get foot massages. We never did, so as I was driving home from the roller derby late last night, I decided to stop by. It was kind of funny. The three people there were lounging around watching TV and didn't notice me. When they finally did, they were uber-apologetic. I agree with My T. These people are incredibly nice and friendly. You can tell they are appreciative of your business.

Rex had me sit in one of the ""rooms"" with two chairs. I removed my shoes and he soaked them in a baby oil and lotion concoction. I told him I wanted 60 minutes and he got started. From head to toe, it was a great massage. He used quite a lot of pressure, which actually felt a little uncomfortable at times, but I didn't really want him to ease up.

The place overall is super relaxing. They had soothing music playing and the massage chairs are sleep-inducing. I may have been lucky in that there were no other customers around. I've read stories at other foot spas where the people running the place would just talk on the phone and be completely inconsiderate of the customer. Although Rex did answer his phone once, he whispered a quick conversation, hung up, and apologized.

There's currently special Yelp pricing. However, even though Rex knew I was there because of Yelp (and Misti and Bobby), he never mentioned it. Or maybe he forgot. I decided to not bring it up. The experience was worth the regular $38 price tag. It's like I gave him a little extra for the tip. Of course, when I return, I better start taking advantage of it. It's going to add up quickly."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"I first went to Bachi Burger last summer. My story seems to match everyone else's - good food but slow service. Shortly after my review, I received a message from Ehren stating that they had made improvements. I'm happy to report that this is indeed the case. Granted, I don't know how much faster the food came out. For sure, it didn't take 40 minutes this time. We had a large group of Yelpers and many ordered appetizers that trickled out at various times. Also, time isn't so much an issue when you're enjoying the company of a big group. Still, I noticed little things that demonstrate their attention to detail and I could tell that they've put in the work to improve.

So how was the food? The food quality at Bachi Burger has never been a concern. On this visit, I went with the Bachi Fish. I also went all out and added their Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries to my order. The Bachi Fish was out of this world. Easily one of the best fish sandwiches I've ever had, the cod was perfectly cooked and the flavors mingled together to create an enjoyable experience in each bite. As for the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, they were good. The thing is, they might as well have been regular Chili Cheese Fries. I could definitely see there was Oxtail in it. I just wish it was more prominent.

The advantage of being in a big group is in the sampling of other people's dishes. Elnino ordered the Chili flavored Edamame and they were delicious. Someone else passed around a plate of Bachi Chili Fried Chicken. They were tender, flavorful, and came with a great dipping sauce. For me, the huge surprise was the Bachi Pickles platter that Nelson ordered. In particular, those cloves of garlic were insanely good. I'm definitely ordering that next time.

Well done Bachi Burger. You've really changed my perception of your establishment. My only regret is that it took me so long to come back."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"I've been eating too much lately. Way too much. So what do I do when I get a text invite to do Tofu Hut AYCE at 11:30pm?

It was my first time there. I really didn't know about it. At $13.99, this place kills the $26 table-grilled item I ordered at Pho So 1 just a few nights ago. (Then again, you're probably supposed to share that one). For $13.99, you get to choose from everything but the last two items (short ribs and steamed egg); those are available at the $16.99 AYCE price, but we were happy with sticking to $13.99.

We started with Sliced Ribeye, Brisket, and Beef Tongue. The ribeye was the most flavorful, but I have a soft spot for beef tongue, nay, I freakin' heart beef tongue! The brisket was OK. We liked the ribeye so much, we ordered another plate. I also added Tripe Honeycomb to the mix. I love tripe too. It had a nice spice to it and charring it on the grill added nice flavor.

On our final round, we went with the Squid and Marinated Pork Belly. The squid was OK, but not a lot of flavor. The pork belly had good spice and went well with the steamed rice I had left (I wasn't eating much of it up to this point). Speaking of steamed rice, they bring out a plethora of side dishes to go with the meats - Kimchi, Pickled Cucumber, Pickled Radish, and other stuff I can't name. Everything that hit the table was delicious.

Oh yeah. My friend wanted to order OB, but they were out, so we settled for Hite. Not a bad beer, but nothing memorable.

Overall, I have to give them four stars. Granted, it was my first time at any place that does that style of AYCE, but I fully enjoyed it. It was a fun time with some photographer friends that I hadn't seen in a while. Jason put it best when he said, ""I don't know if I needed the giant meat fest, but I sure enjoyed it."" That's what she said?

One last thing: your clothes will definitely smell like food when you leave!"
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"We enjoyed a nice Valentine's dinner at Chart House before heading across the tracks to The Smith Center. I chose this place because of its proximity to our show and because the girlfriend used to eat at the Portland location all the time. I guess it's tough to top a view of the Willamette, but the gargantuan aquarium that anchors the Vegas spot is a sweet feature. We were at the end of the tank and with the way the glass curved, watching the fish sometimes felt like a 3D movie.

We started our evening with a couple of cocktails. I had their version of a Bold Manhattan. The girlfriend had the Downtowner. The Manhattan was enjoyable but very sweet. I preferred the Downtowner (and indeed ordered my own).

As for food, we thought everything we ate was great. We shared the Roasted Beet Salad to begin our meal. The fact that they split it up onto two plates was a nice touch. Not quite as spectacular as we've had before, but excellent nonetheless. For the main course, I ordered the Bronzed Swordfish while the girlfriend chose the Tour de Shrimp. We accompanied that with their Asian Green Beans and Gorgonzola Risotto. Everything was well-cooked and well-seasoned. No complaints whatsoever. And the plentiful leftovers were just as delicious the next day.

Ever since I saw Superman II as a kid, I always wanted to eat a soufflé but just never got around to it I guess. So it was a must that we tried their Chart House Soufflé. It was much too sweet for me, though the server did warn us about that. Luckily, the Grand Marnier Crème Anglaise complemented it perfectly. You're supposed to choose a sauce, but the server allowed us to have all three on the side. The raspberry had a nice tartness to it that also helped break up the sweetness of the soufflé.

A note on parking: It seems like you now need to stay at the hotel or dine at one of their restaurants in order to get validated."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"I do not enjoy giving bad reviews, but based on principle, I have to give Merkato one star.

First, I should state that the dining experience itself was good. We enjoyed the food. Being Filipino, we grew up eating with our hands. The prices are cheap. We went with a combination sampler plate for $15, which gave us a great introduction to their cuisine. We also ordered their whole fish dish for $10. It actually came with two nice sized fish and a large plate of rice with tasty sauce.

If you want, you can stop reading here and head on over to try their food. You'll probably enjoy it.

Everything was going well until it came time to settle the bill. I had a TownHog certificate for $30. I had mentioned it before we ordered, but suddenly the server said she didn't know what to do with it. She tried calling the owners but was unable to reach them after several attempts. Strangely enough, when she had me call using my phone, they picked up right away.

To cut to the chase, the owner said he would not honor the coupon. He said he had called the company back in June and told them he no longer wanted to participate. So after sitting there for a long time, we ended up paying and leaving with a very bitter taste in our mouths.

I just got off the phone with TownHog. The representative said that because Merkato has already been paid, she would have to call them to confirm that they refused the coupon before I can get a refund. They've already been paid? That just makes the situation worse. It's just not right. You agreed to sell these coupons in order to get people into your restaurant. That's exactly the reason I was even there in the first place. It's essentially marketing and it worked. It got me into your shop.

It's really a shame because we did enjoy the food. But there's no way I can return based on that ordeal. Luckily, there are other Ethiopian joints around town with similarly good reviews."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"I booked a room here for a place to crash after last weekend's beer festival. During check-in, I discovered that we were getting a room across the bridge in the Luna building. We drove around, parked in the underground lot, and took the convenient elevator to the top floor. Everything great so far.

The room surpassed my admittedly meager expectations. Not sure if we got lucky or if they are all like this. It was very spacious and clean. The kitchenette has everything you might need--fridge, dishwasher, microwave, stove. The separate bedroom is large for the single king bed it houses. Same thing for the bathroom--huge and bright with updated amenities. The balcony faced west and had a nice view of the lake. If there is one thing that needs attention, it's the outdated TVs. At least there was one in both the living room and the bedroom.

It later dawned on me that this building used to (or possibly still is) a condominium. The mailbox cluster out front was my first clue.

My girlfriend and I ended up on the sofa bed. At first contact, it seemed like it would be terribly uncomfortable. But we both woke up the next morning enjoying a great night's sleep. Perhaps that was the alcohol.

My one complaint? Why on Earth would you ever, EVER close the bridge? When we were walking from the room to the main village, we found that the bridge was closed until 6:30pm for a wedding. That's just a terrible idea. (1) It's very inconvenient for your guests. I admit that the walk around wasn't that bad in the end. But the idea that you're basically cutting your guests off from the majority of your resort is just silly. (2) The bridge is so unfinished. Why would you want to hold your wedding there? The security guy said it only happens a few times a year. How about never? It's dumb. Stop it.

So yes, I'm allowing that to bring my rating down. We definitely had a nice stay, but the bridge thing is just bad business."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"I must say, as much as Vegas changes and new hotels continue to pop up, I still have to hand it to the Bellagio as one of my favorites. Sure Steve Wynn went on to bigger and arguably better things at the Wynn and Encore. But when it comes to classic styling, the Bellagio takes the crown.

There are several reasons why the Bellagio still tops my list. One huge reason is the awesome fountain display out front. It's easily the best free entertainment we have on the strip. Whenever I have friends visit from out of town, I always recommend they catch a show or two. My favorite, hands down, is Con Te Partiro (Time to Say Goodbye), but anything from Frank Sinatra satiates my appetite for dancing water. Heck, I'll even take some Celine.

I have also stayed in one of their suites. This was years ago right after Ocean's 11 came out. Some friends were intent on experiencing the Vegas depicted in the film and pretty much showed up to the front desk and paid for the room. It's one of the nicest rooms I've ever stayed in. I've seen the suites at the Venetian and Palazzo and they are very nice too, but there's just something about the Bellagio.

Don't forget the always changing Conservatory and it's seasonal botanical garden display. They don't seem to change it out as often as they used to, but it's always worth checking out.

Of course, you also have the hand-blown glass flowers that adorn the ceiling of the foyer. I didn't fully appreciate them when I first saw them, but they've grown on me. Just the amount of work that went into all that art - it's truly amazing. In fact, that was the reason I went there today and consequently, that's pretty much the reason why I'm writing this review. I snapped a pic for my daily photo blog and I needed an excuse to share it here on Yelp.

Sure other strip hotels have outdone the Bellagio. Sure it's no longer the place to be on the strip. But class never goes out of style. And the Bellagio has plenty of it."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"Honestly, Steak 'n Shake isn't amazing. Sometimes we fall in love with an idea. Or a memory. SnS is a perfect example of this. Some people grew up with it in the Midwest and miss it. I've only had SnS a couple of times. But that first time, it was late, I was a little drunk, I had never heard of SnS before, and I thought it was the greatest sandwich I had ever eaten.

Fast forward to today. Based on that one memory, I had been anticipating SnS's opening for several months. I went on ""opening day"" (based on the press release anyway) and endured the 30-minute line. Did it live up to the hype? Yes and no. I mean, how could it? I still think the best items at SnS are pretty damn good. There are also items that are pretty meh (I experienced this blahness the second time I ate SnS).

On this visit, I ordered the A-1 Peppercorn Melt w/ Fries. For the heck of it, I decided to add one of their Steakburger shooters w/ Chipotle sauce. And of course, I had to get a shake. I went with a Banocolate - a combination of banana and chocolate.

The melt was very good. It was the kind of sandwich that reminded me of that first mythical time eating SnS. The shooter was an example of meh. Not ordering one of those again. As for the shake, just like its flavors, I'm a little mixed on it. For me, the novelty of the half and half shake has worn off. The banana strangely overpowered the neighboring chocolate. Next time, I think I'll get a straight malt. Speaking of which, my cousin got a Hershey's Special Dark Chocolate Malt. I tried it. It was good. But I was a little disappointed in its lack of ""maltiness.""

By the way, our server, Luciane, was attentive and very friendly. This is to be expected on opening day. She was perhaps a little too attentive. She kept asking how everything was before we had even tried.

If you're not a die hard SnS fan, you might want to wait a couple of weeks for the lines to die down. Bottom line: I'm still a fan and I'm glad they're here."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"""Spring"" Restaurant Week 2013 finally gave me the opportunity to check out le faux Tour Eiffel. In my OpenTable reservation, I mentioned RW and the fact that I would like a seat overlooking the Bellagio fountains.

Silly me. The fountains don't start up until 3pm. We did get our window seat, at least. Though I didn't check out the other side, I'm happy our table was along the window angled toward Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and the Paris balloon. The view was so enjoyable, we didn't miss the fountains at all.

I suppose I should talk about the food. In a word, it was outstanding. They started us out with the amuse-bouche of the day. It was some sort of sunchoke mousse and it certainly amused my bouche. But the star of the meal for me was the beet salad. Easily the best beet salad I've ever had, the RW menu description reads, ""Spring Greens, Smoked Candy Striped, Red And Golden Beets, Fromage Blanc."" Délicieux!

Not wanting to turn this into a novel, the main course (""Sauteed Veal Medallion, Green Pea Mousseline, Wild Forest Mushrooms"") and dessert (""Mixed Berry Pudding, Strawberry, Blueberry, Raspberry, Framboise, Creme Fraiche"") were also fantastic. Wait a second. Framboise means raspberry. Redundant!

The wonderful setting and the fabulous food would be diminished if the service wasn't also impeccable. Our waiter knew we were there for RW and he was very knowledgeable about our meal. I chose to do the $16 wine pairing and I enjoyed his tidbit about Willamette Valley being the same latitude as the best pinot regions in France. Sure made that glass of vin taste just that much better. It was also a nice finishing touch as he brought out a selection of chocolates and candy. My choice of passion fruit jelly was delectable.

Having been to la vraie Tour Eiffel, I've been skeptical about visiting the Vegas version. But this restaurant, with its romantic window tables, has made me a believer. I look forward to returning for dinner with the Bellagio fountains in full force."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"I'm a new fan of this place. I just wish it wasn't all the way on the other side of the valley. Hows about opening one on the west side?

I'm fairly new to the craft beer scene. In fact, I used to not care for beer at all. I'm really enjoying what I've discovered recently. My buddy is a beer snob and has been schooling me on the finer points of the brew. Honestly, it all goes over my head. I just know what I like.

We finally made it down to Aces & Ales because of a Deschutes-related event they had on Saturday night. My friend is all about this Oregon brewer and he didn't want to miss this opportunity.

As soon as we stepped in the door, we wasted no time. I asked the bartender about her favorite Deschutes. I put my trust in her and ordered the Jubel 10. It was probably a little strong for my first drink of the night. At 10%, it definitely got me going and I never looked back. It's not really my type of beer, but I still enjoyed it.

Next up on my itinerary was the Hop Henge, followed by the Hop Trip. I thoroughly enjoyed both beers, but I'd give the edge to the Hop Henge. It's a little sweeter and exactly what I hope a good IPA would taste like.

I took a break from the Deschutes and tried the Sah'Tea by Dogfish Head. It's supposedly infused with some chai tea. It was OK, but not really my cup of tea (pun intended). After that, I rounded out the night by switching back to the Hop Henge.

Somewhere in the midst of all this beeration, we ordered an interesting menu item - Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds. It just sounded intriguing on the menu and it was even better in real life! Those cheese curds were perfectly breaded and fried, and were incredibly light and delicious.

The down side to all this hoppy goodness is the price. We spent a good amount on the night, but you get what you pay for. We also got to meet the owner of Deschutes. He offered to give us a free round, but by that point, our ride had arrived so we had to bounce. Our consolation was a free Deschutes glass."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"We finally decided to check out Master Kim for the girlfriend's nephew's birthday. So basically we went to Master Kim's for Master Kim's birthday. We showed up at 4pm on a Saturday and only waited about 10 minutes. Hooray for that!

There are three levels of AYCE. Whatever option you select applies to the entire party. It's not readily obvious what the differences are among the price points. After figuring that out, we decided to go with the top tier (currently $33.95 with the kid being half price for being under 5 feet tall).

For our first order, we made sure to get all four portions of the beef items that are exclusive to the top tier. That would be the Black Angus Snow Boneless Short Rib, Black Angus Outside Skirt, and Black Angus Beef Tenderloin. In short, all three were fantastic and well worth the upgrade over the other price options. We could have stopped there and I would have been satisfied.

We didn't stop, of course. We continued with their black pork belly and black pork shoulder, as well as their Black Angus rib eye. The kid loves samgyeopsal but for me it's always a step down from good quality beef (especially the items we started with). The rib eye was also great but not on the same level as the first three meats.

We rounded out our meal with some corn cheese, the requisite gyeran jjim, doenjang jjigae, and a couple bowls of naengmyeon. Wait, you can order full bowls of naengmyeon and bibimbap! It's one per person, but still, that's quite the ""side dish.""

Finally, we had some of their ice cream/sorbet for dessert with a couple of hotteok (they ran out and could only give two). The pistachio ice cream reminded us of Thrifty but not in a bad way. We enjoyed the conclusion to our 2-hour meal. (I just now noticed that there is supposedly a 2-hour time limit).

I definitely walked away impressed with one of the best AYCE KBBQ meals I've had in recent memory. And for what it's worth, the kid from Korea declares that it's the best KBBQ he's ever had in Las Vegas."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"I'm giving this place four solid stars. My friend and I ate here during happy hour after seeing a movie at Red Rock. We stuck with the HH menu - some Garlic Knots, Chicken Tenders, and of course, their draught beer. The knots were delicious and definitely a HH crowd pleaser. The chicken was pretty good; they were tender fingers, but even though we ordered them hot, I could almost detect no spiciness.

To wash down the food, I had a Blonde Ale, while my friend started with their Hardway IPA and then switched to the Blonde Ale. I found the Blonde Ale to be quite tasty. At $2.50 for 22oz, it's definitely a steal. I tried a sample of the IPA and it tasted like a solid IPA! I wasn't in the mood for something that hoppy, but I can see myself ordering it next time. I also had a sample of their blueberry and vanilla wheat. I'm glad I did the sample first because it wasn't something of which I'd want a whole glass. It reminded me of another beer I've tried in the past that tastes like Fruity Pebbles!

What I truly appreciated about our visit today was the service that John provided us. It was just the little things he did to make sure we were happy. After all, it was happy hour. For example, when my friend ordered the IPA, he warned that it might be getting towards the bottom of the barrel, so he brought out a sample first. He also suggested that I get a sample of the blueberry and vanilla wheat first because other people have found it to be too strong in its fruitiness. I was actually going to ask for a sample, but he suggested it ahead of me. (And I'm really glad because I ended up not ordering it). He was also mindful of the fact that we were there for happy hour. He offered and came through by warning us when happy hour was almost over.

I can't speak for their entire menu, but this place is certainly on my list of good happy hours. Oh wait, I need to update my list! It's a little out of my way, but I will definitely return if I'm in the area, especially since I've now decided to see all my films at Red Rock."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"This place is a gem. It must be pretty new because it's right next to my optometrist and I've never seen it before. I guess I just opened myself up to vision jokes. Speaking of which, I should probably Yelp them too.

Anyway, I chose this place based on some strong reviews from Yelp friends. As soon as you walk in, you just sense something different about the place. It has nice decor for sure, but I think what stood out for me were the two old school arcade games sitting near the entrance and the bookshelf full of Manga. (At least I think it's Manga, since I didn't look that closely).

We were seated in a booth. The first thing I noticed was how nice the menus looked. I'm not sure why the word ""menu"" is in quotes, but I like it. The service is excellent. The guy that served us was very friendly and accommodating. On to the food.

* Beef Short Ribs with Korean BBQ Sauce - These were as good as any Kalbi I've had before i.e. yummy.

* Spicy Pork Ribs - These were a little tough, but good flavor and not too much spice.

* Kim Chi Fried Rice - I love any dish that incorporates egg. This was good, but if I had to compare, I would pick the next dish.

* Fried Rice with Smelt Egg in a Stone Pot - That probably isn't the exact name on the menu. I really enjoyed what the smelt egg added to the mix. I also enjoyed the crunchiness of the rice that hardened due to the hot stone pot. It reminded me of my Grandma's fried rice as a kid.

They also bring out complimentary small plates of side items like Kim Chi, Spinach, Pickled Daikon Radish, and Fish Triangle thingies (that's what they're called). Oh and also complimentary - they bring out a pitcher of Barley Iced Tea, complete with metal bowl cups for you to drink out of. Rustic and unique, the cups reminded me of Tournament of Kings. Huzzah!

For the three of us, there was plenty of food. We were all full by the end and we didn't even finish everything. The total only came out to about $40, so it's very affordable. I definitely want to return to try some more items."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"A couple of years ago, a friend of mine told me that this place has the best sushi and the freshest fish. Why the heck did it take me so long to finally try it?

Simply put, Yama Sushi is awesome. You wouldn't know it from the outside. It's in a typical Vegas strip mall near the corner of Flamingo and Maryland. Walk inside and it just automatically feels like you're in for a treat. The decor seems very traditional Japanese. It looked crowded, but we were seated immediately.

So how's the sushi? Amazing. It definitely lived up to expectations. We tried not to go too crazy, but I think we incurred some decent damage.

* Miso Soup
* Edamame
* Seaweed Salad
* Seafood Salad
* Soft-Shell Crab
* Salmon Kama
* Unagi
* Ikura with Quail Egg
* Yama Roll
* Roger Roger Roll
* Soft-Shell Crab Roll
* Dancing In The Sheet Roll
* Mochi (Strawberry, Mango, and Chocolate)

A definite must-order is the Seafood Salad (limit one per person). It's basically a plate of sashimi stirring in some mild or spicy dressing. I know of no other AYCE menu that offers sashimi. Pretty much everything we ordered was delicious. The only thing I won't order again is the Soft-Shell Crab appetizer. Breaded in Panko and deep-fried, it's just a little too oily and unnecessary. I'll stick with the sushi and salads next time.

I'm not sure if we got lucky, but the service is incredibly fast. Since we were only an hour out from closing time, we started marking things on our paper menu as soon as we sat down. I went out to get my camera from the car, and as soon as I got back, it seemed like items just kept coming at a rapid pace. Fortunately, I eat at a rapid pace!

By the way, at $22.95 for dinner, this is one of the cheaper AYCE sushi spots. Not by much, but it's worth mentioning.

I've said before that I'm really not that picky when it comes to sushi. Lately, I've been holding back on my five star ratings. Yama Sushi deserves a five. With fast service, delicious and fresh offerings, and a very competitive price, it just does the AYCE thing right."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"My cousin loves this place. We were actually seated at Steak N Shake and we had this epiphany that we should go get sushi instead. So we got up and drove all the way up the I-15 to Osaka.

When you enter, you're greeted by a blank wall. What is this - a Japanese Speakeasy? You then turn right and go through another door that takes you to a small sushi bar area. From this initial view, you'd think the place was tiny. If you continue to the back and left, though, you discover that the place can seat quite a lot of people. They have a Teppanyaki area and a surprising number of private booths and traditional looking Japanese sunken dining tables. The space is very aesthetically pleasing.

Unfortunately, when it came to the food, I was disappointed. I really wasn't that hungry, but I tried everything that my cousin ordered. We stuck to their late night special menu that is available 10pm-2am.

* Beef Tataki Salad - It looked amazing, but it lacked flavor. I think I've only ever had Beef Tataki at Ichiza and theirs runs circles around Osaka's.
* King Crab Tempura - This was easily the best thing we ordered. Delicious.
* Salmon Skin (half) Roll - This also lacked flavor. I'm kind of a purist in that I like to eat sushi exactly how the chef made it. I never use soy sauce or add wasabi. I stuck to my guns on this, despite the roll really needing the extra flavor.
* Screaming Orgasm (ahi sashimi on top of some salad) - This also looked amazing. It had better flavor than the Beef Tataki, but I wasn't blown away by it. The dressing was a little too vinegary.

On the plus side, the service was excellent. The two ladies that served us were extremely friendly and attentive to our needs. The green tea tasted great and was the perfect thing on my still recovering throat. Whenever I was running low on tea, the lady would come back and top it off promptly.

I really hate giving less than three stars, but I must stay true to the rating system. Indeed, I have experienced better. It's too bad because the service and decor of Osaka are top notch."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"Biaggio joins Bo from Yi Mei Champion Deli on the list of the absolute nicest owners you could ever meet. People like Biaggio are the precise reason why we need to support our local businesses. Great food. Personal service. Owners who aren't happy until you're happy.

It was New Year's Day and my friend and I were looking for a place to watch the Rose Bowl. I called Biaggio's to make sure they'd be open and he said they'd switch the channel to whatever we wanted to watch.

When we got there, Biaggio somehow recognized me from Yelp. He knew I was the one who ended up backing out of the CMYE. Wow! For someone who claims to not be all that internet-savvy, he sure does keep a finger on the pulse of social media.

Long story short, my friend ordered an Italian Stromboli and I had a Pastrami Stromboli. We didn't realize how huge they would be, so we added some Garlic Knots for good measure. The Garlic Knots were extremely moist and doughy on the inside. And they're huge! But nowhere near as huge as the Strombolis. Even with a 3-hour game, there was no way we'd be able to eat all that food. Oh and yes, the Strombolis were all they were hyped up to be. I personally like the Pastrami over the Italian and my friend concurs. So delicious.

With our Strombolis only half eaten, the food coma was setting in and we decided to leave at half time. Biaggio stops us and says we have some Fried Dough on the way. Um. OK. How can you turn down free food from such a generous man? Of course, the Fried Dough was awesome. It's basically pizza dough topped with butter, cinnamon, and powdered sugar. It smelled really sweet, but it was surprisingly mellow. We had a few pieces and added the rest to our to-go boxes.

It goes without saying that I'll be coming back. I need to try the Chicken Wings that everyone is raving about. Also, when I mentioned that my boss loves pastrami, he offered to send us a Pastrami Stromboli when I return to work on Monday. Now that is the epitome of generosity! (I'll be sure to supplement that with my own order of Chicken Wings).

YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"Time for me to weigh in on the so-called arrival of ""real sushi"" in Las Vegas. Long story short, Kabuto is phenomenal. If you're looking for traditional Edomaezushi, look no further. You want the freshest of sushi neta flown in from various parts of the world each day? Do you dream of meticulously constructed nigiri with just the right amount of real wasabi and a brush of aged shoyu? Your search has ended.

Every aspect of Kabuto oozes excellence. The exterior is very unassuming and elegant in its simplicity. No gaudy signs. No sign at all, in fact. Just a small window strip display lets you know you've arrived at the right place. This simple elegance continues with the interior decor. Nothing seems out of place. Do yourself a favor and sit at the beautiful cypress sushi bar. This is where the magic happens.

The quality of product is only half the story at Kabuto. There is something truly captivating about watching a highly skilled Itamae (that's probably redundant) prepare these edible works of art. Do yourself another favor--eat the nigiri with your hands. This is something I learned a long time ago, but Kabuto is the first place that I truly felt like it was the only way to go.

Now about this ""real sushi"" business, if I'm not mistaken, sushi refers to the vinegared rice. I hazard to say that the art of sushi has merely evolved. There is a place in this world for AYCE and unagi nigiri and Yum Yum Rolls. (Not that I've ever had a Yum Yum Roll, nor do I know what it even contains, but I like the fact that it seems to be the current Yelp running gag). I mean, as much as people romanticize sushi, it originated as street fast food! Then again, that sounds like fast food heaven to me.

I think I have The Avengers on the brain, but Kabuto is like Captain America. He's a little old fashioned. But as Agent Coulson states, sometimes we need a little old fashioned. Actually, Kabuto is like The Avengers film itself. No matter how elevated your expectations are, you won't walk away disappointed.

Jiro dreams of sushi. I daydream of returning to Kabuto."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"Vegas Hot! provides an interesting variation on the 26 asanas of the popular Bikram Yoga routine. There appear to be quite a lot of politics behind their conversion from Bikram, but I won't get into that.

I got to try a free class courtesy of houseseats. The location is easy to spot from Rainbow Blvd. Strangely enough, it's a little confusing to actually find the entrance. It's best if you park in the back. There are signs that then point you up some fire escape stairs and to the studio entrance.

The foyer area is large but minimally decorated. I can only compare to Bikram Yoga Summerlin, which has been my only other exposure to heat-intensified yoga. BYS is well-decorated and has the expected look and feel of a yoga studio. On the other hand, VH! has a larger locker room than BYS. I like their wooden lockers - very rustic.

Of course, what really matters is the class itself. I really like their large classroom. The floor is made of some sort of rubber/plastic compound. It seems like it would be much more sanitary than the carpeted flooring that Bikram Choudhury reportedly requires. My coworker is paranoid about athlete's foot and this is something he always mentioned about BYS. I also love the fact that VH! has lines running across the length of the classroom. The distance between the lines is the exact length of a standard yoga mat. This sounds like it would work perfectly for mat placement when the classes are full.

I'm not a yoga expert, so I can't comment too much on the routine. I was in their ""Venus"" class, which is supposedly good for beginners. I didn't get the instructor's name, but she was friendly and helpful. The thing is, BYS has probably the most friendly instructors I've ever met. From your very first class, they try to know everyone by name and really make you feel welcome. Not to say that VH! isn't as friendly. BYS just left me with a high water mark when it comes to instructor bubbliness.

Overall, I like this place. Their prices are cheaper and they are much closer to my house. The only thing is, I'm not really interested in getting into hot yoga right now."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"I've been to Imperial a couple of times. I'm a fan of the place, but I needed something to compare it to before reviewing. Now that I've experienced a Korean spa in LA, my appreciation for Imperial has increased.

You wouldn't expect something so nice in this part of town. The facilities are clean and well-maintained. Imperial Health Spa has everything you need in a Jjimjilbang. The gender-specific sauna areas provide lockers, towels, toiletries, showers, hot/cold tubs, and salt/steam/dry saunas. This is where you start and end your Korean spa experience. We typically just put our things in our lockers (your wristband is your locker key), take a quick shower, change into the provided shirt and shorts, and head up to the second floor.

The co-ed space upstairs is the ""hangout."" You can lounge around and watch Korean TV, get some surprisingly good food in the little restaurant (you charge everything to your wristband), and experience the various rooms. My favorites include the Bulgama room and the clay sauna. The Bulgama is the hottest of the saunas and features eight oven-like structures for you to lie inside. If you've ever wondered how a turkey feels at Thanksgiving, this is your chance. In the clay sauna, you immerse yourself in a bed of hot clay balls. It's awesome once you get used to it. We also enjoy cooling off in the ice sauna in between rounds.

When we're done relaxing upstairs, we split back up and go do our things in the naked areas. Oh, did I forget to mention that? In the shower/tub/sauna section downstairs, you're supposed to be clothless. I usually try to use both the steam and dry saunas, as well as the hot and maybe the cold tub. Once my skin is sufficiently tenderized, I do a little self-exfoliation scrubbing. They offer body scrub services (and I hear your skin feels amazing afterward), but I have yet to work that in during a visit.

Needless to say, I always feel uber-relaxed after spending a few hours at Imperial Health Spa. Just a word of caution. Don't go here expecting solitude and quiet. Jjimjilbangs are places for friends and families to hang out. It's the perfect place to bring a bunch of friends and just chill for several hours."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"My first experience at BAR is like the final Harry Potter film - it's a two-parter. My friends and I needed a spot to watch the UNLV vs Louisville game on Saturday morning. My coworker is always talking about BAR, so I figured we'd give it a shot. I even found a $25 Restaurant.com coupon that I purchased for only $2.

Apparently, this place has become quite the popular hangout in its short existence. It was packed with Rebel fans. Luckily, my friends had already snagged a table. But just like our team's second half woes, we had a pretty crappy experience. The service was nonexistent. My friends received their coffees and I asked for some water to start with; it never came. A server finally returned with about 7 minutes to go in the second half. By about half time, I figured I'd just finish the game and then go get some street food at the Hanshiktaco/Slider Truck throwdown.

I decided that I couldn't fairly rate BAR based on that one experience. It was early AM and I'm sure they're not usually that busy. Also, I still had a coupon to use. I returned that same evening with my cousin. This time, the place was empty and we received proper service.

Long story short, I ordered Linguini Con Scampi and my cousin got the Black Friday sliders (essentially Thanksgiving on a slider). My pasta dish was very good, had ample shrimp, and I couldn't get enough of that sauce. My cousin's sliders were decent, though slightly on the dry side. Speaking of which, BAR has an extensive slider menu. I heard the Slider Truck guys came here to give them all a try.

I like the decor of the place; it's pretty stylish for a bar. It has a big wall of TVs, as well as a scattering of TVs to catch your favorite sports. I also like the name of the place. It really captures the home grown aspect of the business. They even have a wall of local photos that are community-provided. Nice touch.

In the end, I'm giving BAR an A-OK based on my mixed experiences. While my linguini was good, I'm not sure it was worth $18 (hooray for coupons). The sliders are much more reasonable for $8-12. I wouldn't mind trying their Eggs Benedict ($9). I'm not in a rush to return, but I'd be OK with it should it be suggested."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"I've only been to Big Dog's twice. It's just so damn far and there's no good route for me to get there. Otherwise, I'd make my way out there more often.

The first time I went was for their War Dog tapping party. I actually had another anti-teetotalism gathering at the Freakin' Frog that night. But I had always wanted to try Big Dog's, so I did the mini-road trip from work (near McCarran) all the way up to the great northwest. I was hoping to get there in time for a free appetizer, but that didn't work out. I ended up just getting my free pint of War Dog and leaving. Let me just say that the War Dog IPA is delicious.

By the way, I then turned around and made another mini-road trip back down south to the Freakin' Frog to meet up with my friends. Ken M says I deserve a beer badge for making that beer venue combo in one night.

My second visit to Big Dog's was for their Winterfest. Great event. I went with the 30-token + tasting glass starter pack for $30. I really didn't drink that much beer. My 30 tokens got me the following:

* Half pour of Big Dog's Raspberry Brewbie SupPorter. Yeah this was more like a full pour. Very tasty and part of the proceeds went toward the Keep a Breast Foundation.
* Quarter pour of New Belgium's La Folie Sour Brown Ale. Despite it's supposed ""limited quantity,"" they gave me more like a half pour. Not complaining! This was extremely sour, kind of like Sour Warheads. It was worth trying, but not sure if I'd ever order it at a bar.
* Half pour of Big Dog's Doghouse Dunkelweizen. Didn't like this all that much.
* Half pour of Deschutes' Hop in the Dark Cascadian Pale Ale. Absolutely delicious! Probably my favorite beer of the afternoon.
* 2 bowls of Chicken and Shrimp Gumbo. Obviously delicious, since I went back for seconds.
* 1 bowl of Chile Verde. Good flavor and spice.
* 2 Oyster Shooters. Made with Black Lab Stout. Surprisingly delicious.

So I have yet to go to Big Dog's for a non-event. I definitely will return one day though. I still need to try their Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds (and compare them to Aces & Ales).

Oh and I love that it's a Packers bar. I'm not a huge Packers fan, but it would be fun to catch a game there maybe next season."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"It's been years since I've had hair on my head. So what am I doing inside a salon? Late on a Friday night, no less?

The answer involves three simple letters. BAO.

I've been wanting to check this place out for a while. I was in the area and found out via twitter that they were open late this Friday evening. (They've been staying open late on Friday nights for the past few weeks).

This cute little cafe is the epitome of random. Nestled within a pretty large salon, you will find Chef Sheridan Su and Jen Jen (it said that on her t-shirt) behind a small hole-in-the-wall counter. It's a very intimate setting and you get to watch them preparing your food. As such, I think I picked the perfect time to try this place for the first time. With no one else around, it felt like I was in their home and as they were fixing me a late night meal, we chatted back and forth getting to know one another.

With a couple as friendly and adorable as Sheridan and Jenny, I was immediately a fan of Great Bao, but how is their food?

I went with the ComBAO. This allows you to pick any three bao plus a drink for $10 (tax included). I opted for duck, pork, and chicken. The bread was so light and fluffy. I like theirs better than The Chairman truck. Each bao had something I liked and I fully enjoyed them all. But if I had to pick one, I'd probably go with duck. Honestly though, that's only ever-so-slightly ahead of pork, followed closely by chicken. According to Chef Su, I was the first to try a chicken wing version--the chicken bao is usually made with breast and thigh meat.

As for the drink, I went with a peach Italian soda with cream. It was surprisingly delicious. For some reason, it reminded me of a guava drink--very refreshing. After I was done with my three bao, Jenny asked me if I was ready for three more bao. What? I was so confused. Then she hands me a basket with three tiny balls of some sort of honey-biscuit-something-or-other. Funny and cute. Well played Jenny.

So a big thumbs up on the delicious food, the tasty beverage, the friendly service, the intimate atmosphere, and the quirky location inside a salon. Plus, I always love meeting awesome small business owners. Everything about Great Bao Asian Cafe is simply fantastic."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"I was recently having a conversation with some people about this place. For some reason, we were also talking about Groupons. I said that if a Groupon ever came up for Via Brasil, I'm jumping on it. Lo and behold, a Groupon appears days later. It was a sign.

I'm pretty sure Via Brasil takes up the space that was formerly (and quite briefly) a Makino's. It's a nice, large, and elegantly decorated restaurant. As soon as you step inside, you know you're in for a culinary treat.

After you're seated, they explain the red/green system - green of course meaning that you're ready for meat! My card stayed green for most of the night. To put it succinctly, Via Brasil serves up some of the most amazing cuts of meat I've ever eaten. Sure there were some items that weren't quite up to par, but most of it was absolutely awesome. To be honest, it's all quite a blur. They just kept coming and coming and coming. And I just kept saying yes yes yes!

Surprisingly, I didn't enjoy the bacon-wrapped tenderloin that much. It was the weirdest and most unexpected thing. I actually thought the bacon got in the way of the flavor! On the other end of the spectrum, the last cut I received was some sort of garlic-infused meat. Looking at their web site, I think it is the ""Noble Cut of Picanha in Garlic."" Wow. I was full by that point, but that didn't stop me from getting a second cut. It was the perfect ending.

If I ever go back, I think I know what strategy I would employ. I noticed that the cuts of meat I enjoyed most were light and very much on the rare side. The cuts I didn't enjoy as much tended to be dense, which caused them to be not as tender and way more filling.

Oh I should mention the salad bar. You might think one would ignore it. The reality is, you need something on your plate to balance out that meat. It's really much more than just a salad bar and the choices are mostly delicious, but definitely use that only as a complement to the meat. You are here for the meat!

One thing I didn't realize is that dessert is not included. I couldn't resist getting some of their Tiramisu. It was pretty good, but not sure it was worth the extra $8. I know it's a silly thing to mention since the Rodizio meal is $43, but it's good to know.

OK this is long enough. Way too long. FOUR STARS!"
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"It is high time that I update my review for Soyo. It's been almost exactly a year since I first reviewed it and I've been back quite a few times since. Along with a plethora of other Yelpers, I absolutely love this place. No doubt, the food is great. But what makes Soyo such a great spot to hang out is the atmosphere. This is definitely a place you want to hit up with a few friends.

Some of our faves...

* Budae Jjigae aka Korean Army Stew - I never really understood why people love this so much. The first couple of times I tried it, it was OK. But this past Monday, that stew was completely on point. It just hit that perfect amount of heat to make you want to keep eating it. And let's face it. As Anthony M and Tien N can attest, it's filled with all the bad things you love--sausages, bacon, SPAM. It's a great stew to share among three of four friends. Don't worry if you can't find it on the menu. I never can either.

* Fried Rice with Smelt Egg in a Stone Pot - I can never remember the exact name of this dish, but it's absolutely delicious. After they bring it out, make sure to let it sit for a few minutes to allow the bottom to crisp up. Then mix all that goodness up with a spoon before you dig in. It's worth the extra wait. The smelt egg really adds great flavor to this rice dish.

* Chicken Wings - I don't remember the exact name of this dish either. It doesn't matter. They're insanely good. Props to Misti Y for ordering them. I wouldn't have tried them otherwise. The wings are bursting with flavor and you even get whole cloves of garlic for good and tasty measure.

* Galbi Jjim (Korean Braised Short Ribs) - This is a dish I've only had once thanks to a recommendation from Jieun L. It's a bit on the pricey side at $15, but it was incredibly good. The ribs were flavorful and extremely tender.

* Very Spicy Chicken - The level of heat on this dish has been hit and miss. In fact, I don't think I've ever had it at its legendary spiciness level, which is fine with me. In any case, this is a great choice. The mozzarella cheese isn't something you would expect in a Korean dish, but it's a stroke of genius. Delicious!

I won't continue listing dishes ad nauseam. You get the point. As Jane K mentions in her review, Soyo is simply a fantastic place to hang out. A few hours with a few friends and perhaps a few bottles of soju. Now that's what I call a killer evening."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"I tried Johnny Smalls last night with a meetup group. While they were getting our table ready, a few of us sat at the bar and had a drink. I decided to ask the bartender for one of his personal specialties. He ended up giving me something he calls the Naughty Irishman. I didn't really watch him make it, but it looked like it was primarily Jameson and Bailey's with crushed ice. I give him props for hand crushing the ice. The drink was pretty good, but it came with the typical Vegas price tag of about $13.

Once seated, we did the AYCE tapas thing for $19.99 per person. Note that you technically need a Hard Rock player's card to get that price; otherwise, it's $23.99. Based on the prices of each item, I got my money's worth. On the other hand, if I disregard how much they list each item, I still probably got my money's worth. I'd say their tapas are a mixed bag. Most of them were decent to very good. Nothing was amazing. If I do this again, I have a few items I would skip.

The Good
* Poona Tuna - I started off with this because someone mentioned it on Yelp. The cherry limeade was an interesting sauce and the tuna was maybe slightly overcooked, but I enjoyed the dish.
* Jack & Coke - One of the better items. Very tasty.
* Lettuce Cups - Shrimp was slightly overcooked, but that's just being picky. This was quite tasty.
* Sea Bass - I only tried some of this from someone else's order. It was pretty good, but not my favorite.
* Tuna Sashimi - It's hard to mess up ahi tuna. This was simple and tasty.
* Surf & Turf - The vanilla butter added a strange flavor to the mix, but pretty good overall.
* Grilled PB&J - I found it a little strange that the jelly was on the side i.e. you had to add it yourself, but it was still good. Honestly, I prefer the Fried PB&J we had at the Elite event at Republic, but come on. It's Grilled PB&J!

The Bad
* Chicken & Waffles - Disappointing. The chicken was not tasty at all. I didn't like the breading and (once again) it was overcooked. The waffle fries were pretty good though.
* Octapussy - I don't like the tapioca batter that they use. Skip.

The Ugly
* Tater Tots - It might be the truffle oil, but these smelled and tasted like gasoline. They were nauseous.

You can view their entire tapas menu on their web site: http://bit.ly/jsmalls

I'm going with a rounded down A-OK on Johnny Smalls. I'd return if someone suggested it. The decor is trendy and there are definitely some tasty items here. $20 is a good price."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"The journey of 10,000 calories begins with a single bite.

Six crazy yelpers. Twelve grueling hours. Seven AYCE establishments. This is the story of the BoB.

9am Lago Buffet (Caesars Palace)
My strategy was to eat a single breakfast plate. I went with a smoked salmon made-to-order omelet, some Canadian bacon, and some strawberry yogurt. I also had a couple of mimosas. Good, conservative start to the long day ahead.

10:30am Paradise Garden Buffet (Flamingo)
This initially looked like a pretty crappy buffet, but hidden treasures awaited. First of all, there was another section that we didn't originally see, complete with a crepe station. Then, we discovered an entire Asian section that opens up at 11am. With a nice view of the flamingos outside and more champagne in our glasses, this turned out to be a good buffet. The highlight for me was the Asian food - chicken feet, shumai, and some sort of sake dessert.

12pm Emperor's Buffet (Imperial Palace)
Easily the worst buffet of the bunch. The iced tea tasted strange. I went with a very selective plate of tiny portions. The only positive was that the beef stroganoff was pretty not bad.

1:30pm Flavors Buffet (Harrah's)
Though I had tried to pace myself, the surprisingly good Flamingo buffet filled me up more than I had planned. Still, we powered on. Nice buffet with a good selection. I enjoyed the Churrasco Beef from the Brazilian area, some warm crab legs, and more shumai. Their dessert section was also pretty impressive.

3pm Carnival World Buffet (Rio)
You know you're getting full when the first thing you do is sit down for about five minutes. Don't everyone get up at once! This was the last buffet that treated us to complimentary champagne (but we were in the VIP section, so don't count on that). I forgot how huge the Rio buffet is. Nothing really stood out, but I enjoyed some cold crab legs, more shumai, some freshly served beef broccoli, and some duck.

5pm Le Village Buffet (Paris)
Home stretch! The first and last thing I ate here? Why Crème brûlée of course. Other than that, just your standard fare of prime rib with some asparagus and mushrooms. Surprisingly, the crab legs were not as good as Carnival and Flavors. At least the waiter brought those out to us as opposed to us having to get them.

7pm Spice Market Buffet (Planet Hollywood)
We made it! Diverse selection, featuring a Mid-Eastern section that you don't normally see. Highlights include roasted lamb, lamb stuffed tomatoes, and baklava. Crab legs were also available and sliced in half (length ways) for easy eating, but I was over crab legs by this point.

Dénouement:
All told, the BoB is a great deal. I would never do all seven again, but you would certainly get your money's worth with a couple of dinners and maybe a lunch or breakfast. If I had to pick two, I might go with Planet Hollywood and Harrah's for dinner, with Flamingo for a late breakfast / early lunch (so that you are there as soon as that Asian section opens up with its fresh offerings). The only problem is with lines. We were lucky in that we were hooked up with line passes.

Epilogue:
24 hours after my pre-BoB weigh-in yesterday morning, I'm actually only 1.5 pounds heavier. It helped that I swam some laps and did a few minutes in the wet sauna at the gym last night. Not bad. Not bad at all."
YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,"Our year of Cedar Fair continues with a visit to Carowinds! With first time trips to California's Great America, Cedar Point, and Kings Island, as well as some Knott's Boysenberry Festival mixed in, we've certainly made excellent use of our Platinum Passes.

We picked a great time to visit. I'm a roller coaster guy so that was the priority. On a Wednesday in late August, we were able to do a lap of the park and do everything we wanted in a few hours. We barely waited in line for anything. Upon entering, we decided to turn left and go clockwise. One of the reasons for this strategy was to leave the best ride for last.

Before I get into individual attraction thoughts, my overall impression is a little mixed. Carowinds is certainly a nice park. The areas are clean and well kept as you'd expect from Cedar Fair. I envisioned a little more southern charm being the place ""where the Carolinas come together,"" but this is definitely a corporate park. Not a bad thing; just an observation.

What makes it a must-visit for me is the amazing Fury 325. This is a destination roller coaster. I feel like you have Fury and then you have everything else (Afterburn and the Cirque show are great though). If you decide to stop reading here, the takeaway is that Carowinds is worth the visit just for Fury 325. I even came back the next morning for a few more laps before we checked out of our hotel.

Here are the attractions we hit in order.

* Nighthawk - I remember being intrigued by this protoype ride when it was announced as ""Project Stealth"" at California's Great America back in 2000. On a personal level, it's neat that I finally got to ride the original Vekoma Flying Dutchman. But it's pretty rough and not as enjoyable as Firehawk at Kings Island (a similar coaster).

* Intimidator - This is a pretty good B&M Hyper Coaster that could be more fun if there weren't trim brakes all over the place. Again, Diamondback at Kings Island is a similar coaster that is just much better overall.

* Flying Ace Aerial Chase - This looks pretty much identical to the Kings Island roller coaster of the same name. Unfortunately, the Carowinds version provides a lot of head banging, which is surprising for a family coaster.

* Afterburn - Great B&M inverted coaster with a fun layout and snappy inversions. I do prefer Banshee at Kings Island, but Afterburn is a solid ride and the second best coaster in the park.

* Plants vs Zombies - Kind of a weird shooting game based on the once popular mobile app. Not really worth it but it was on our path and provided a few minutes of A/C.

* Flying Cobras - I appreciate that they updated the restraints to be more comfortable (albeit a bit stinky). But it's still a Vekoma Boomerang and you can take it or leave it.

* Carolina Goldrusher - The park's requisite Arrow mine train coaster. One and done for me.

* Ricochet - This is a decent wild mouse that maintains good speed through the turns.

* Vortex - As one of the few remaining B&M stand-up coasters left in the world, this is surprisingly decent.

* Carolina Cyclone - Kind of your standard double loop, double corkscrew Arrow, but super rough. Ouch.

* Hurler - This is a rough ride. Not in a painful way, but it just shakes you a lot.

* Fury 325 - The main event! I'm glad we left this for last (not counting Woodstock Express that we missed). In a way, every previous roller coaster was like a chore that we had to endure before experiencing nirvana. Amazing first drop. High speed banked curves. Great airtime. Sideways airtime! Constant speed throughout. I personally love the back row in the far left seat.

* Cirque Imagine - Coming from Vegas with a plethora of Cirque Du Soleil, we loved this little show! It's not just an excuse to sit inside an air-conditioned building for 30 minutes. I recommend setting aside time for this.

* Woodstock Express - We missed this during our original lap. It's a somewhat rough kiddie coaster, but the young-ins love it!"
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Had a great time--all 12 of us! Owner Alissa has a new party barn that comfortably holds 12, but we had 14 ladies that fit fine. Outside was cold and rainy, but we were cozy inside with the kids (goats) doing GOAT YOGA. What a hoot. Our yoga instructor--Deanna--was fabulous. She was informative and lead us in positions and yoga poses. There was no stress, just little goats walking around that we petted and held. Alissa walked around tending the kids and keeping them from eating our purses, jackets, etc. LOL so we could do yoga. I took a lot of pictures of everyone. After a good hour we put on our boots and trudged up to the barn to see the other farm animals. Alissa hopes to train the alpacas and piglets to have in yoga sessions. We petted all, and held the two baby goats. Feels Like Home Farm makes you feel comfortable. Someday I'll try alpaca yoga and piglet yoga. Animal Yoga is offered for children's events, too."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Five stars tho service was very slow with one server working a few tables at lunch. I called ahead for a table for six and it was set and ready. Menu has a lot of better bar food. My girl friends eat salads, and the menu had several to choose from. Lots of sandwiches and wings are also offered. I got the beet and arugula salad, and it was one of the best beet salads ever with slices of large red and golden beets laying on a bed of arugula with a lovely raspberry vinaigrette. The Cobb salad looked delicious, and was full of goodies. But the lettuce was not iceberg. It was the spidery kind that's hard to eat and just doesn't go in a Cobb. The girls left most of the lettuce. The sandwiches we saw looked delicious. Homemade potato chips were a treat. I like this place. Tavern Six is a nice restaurant with a clean sports bar decor. A bar is in the middle of the dining room, and there are lots of windows. Clean bathrooms."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Owner Nick has a clientele that travels to savor his lamb gyros, award winning Black Angus burgers and cheesy fries. Many of the ingredients are locally produced/grown. The Tzaziki sauce is the best. Like vegan, vegetarian, GF? He has all kinds of meals for everyone. This small establishment is busy with carry out meals and sit-in customers. It's casual. Order at the counter where Nick will explain everything. If what you want isn't on the menu, ask. I knew at a previous store he had grilled octopus, so I asked. He had Mediterranean octopus which he prepared. It was so tasty!  Juices, water and specialty drinks are in the cooler. Help yourself to the pop machine. The baklava, I've heard, is wonderful. Currently, the shop is not opened on Sundays or Mondays or holidays. The Wednesday night we were there the shop closed at 8 p.m. Nick and his staff enjoy their family time. Read ""From the Business"".  The write-up is informative and right on."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"After walking around the IX Center we wanted lunch on the way home, and we thought of this place. I'm so glad we did!  We enjoyed it. Like a memorial honoring bomber pilots, the restaurant has pictures and mementos on the walls and display tables--hence the name. These guys did a lot for the U.S.A. The venue has several large dining rooms and a large bar area called The Lounge. Large windows face out toward the Cleveland Airport. We ate in The Lounge. Service was very pleasant. We both had the 1/2 salad and 1/2 sandwich for $12. The kale with onion, cranraisins, apples, grapes and cheese salad was adequate and tasty. The turkey club with a cranberry sauce was delicious. The pesto chicken sandwich was very good--breaded white meat with pesto. Bun was fresh and toasted. Both sandwiches had lettuce and a tomato slice. When we received the bill tax was included in the tip. Lots of parking. I would visit again, and check out the bar some evening."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Having read these reviews I was curious how this visit would be. I've been coming here for years, and I've had good experiences. I really like the large eye frame selection in the adjourning room. Entering, the lobby is big and warmly decorated. The one bathroom is not always adequate, but it's clean. The ladies at the window update your information. I've always experienced a reasonable wait time. When called to the back a technician checks your eyes with two machines, and makes notes for the doctor. Then she adds drops. The doctor checks the eyes and describes your eye issues. There are several doctors in the group. I have Dr. Bischoff. When telling me about my eyes he has been spot on to how I see. I have seen Dr. Bischoff for glasses, contact lenses and now I'm learning about my cataracts. Dr. Davis is the surgeon. He does all surgeries including LASIK. I will have a consultation with him next about removing the cataract on my reading eye."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Comfortably dressy decor with oval booths, tables and a bar. Noise level is very good having soft music. Our server was very knowledgeable and professional. She explained a variety of specials, but did not give the prices which would have been nice, especially the surf and turf market price. The beer list is ample and the wine list is extensive. We enjoyed the calamari, salads, ribs and chicken. One in our party, who is a French onion soup connoisseur, said the soup was lacking a large slice of cheese, tho the soup was tasty. The ladies got the trout and they were disappointed. The pretzel crust was not crispy and the goat cheese melted on it did not complement the fish, which was dry and tasteless. The couscous had no flavor. To make better add a crisp pretzel crust with rice pilaf or a green vegetable to add color to the drab dish, and lemon slices. Omit the salad greens. Despite not liking the fish dish, the restaurant is worth checking out."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Milos is top notch. It's high end Mediterranean with a Greek flair, and primarily seafood dishes with vegetarian options, being lots of vegetables and salads. The seafood is flown in from the Sea daily. The server spends time with you to explain the family style dishes, and show you the fish selection that is on ice. We ordered and shared the grilled octopus and crab cake, which looked too small to share, but tasted excellent. Our entree was the salted Black Sea bass. The server brought the cooked fish, covered in salt to hold the moisture, and filleted it in front of us. The fish was very moist and delicious with a nice flavor. It and the sides served the three of us. The sides were Swiss chard, and our choice, couscous. We chose shareable desserts baklava and the fried airy balls with ice cream. Both were delicious. We topped off dinner with a Greek espresso.  The bill and tip can equal a paycheck for your meal = four stars. It's worth coming."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Wowza. Wowza. The newly renovated arena with a new name is fabulous!   Wide open areas with new directional signs help the foot traffic. Interesting historical tidbits cover the main walls that include the champions, Cavs and Monsters. The championship floor has been replaced (yes, a new playing floor has been laid), and is now on a wall!Walk through the light tunnel and watch the lights constantly change to show Cavs pictures. Look for artwork by local artists. Food booths have names recognizable from Ohio City and Tremont. Loudville is still up high where sections of seats have been removed to open the wide space for social time with Buds and food. And the food is everywhere. I love an area that was hidden before is now dotted with tables and the window wall shows the baseball stadium. It is so cool!  And stand in the new Antrim. Look around. Everything is stunning. When leaving, look back at the Antrim glass and see the reflection of Cleveland."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Five stars. Almost perfect--The wait, the service, the food, the atmosphere.  Our server started us with the traditional veggies, cottage cheese, and warm bread. 
After telling us about the wonderful specials we decided on escargot, baked Brie, strawberry salad, and prime rib. Excellent choices.  The clam bake was also an option.  The waitress checked on us several times. Our water glasses were kept full. We declined dessert although the menu included many choices. 

Upon finishing we walked around the tavern that opened in1928. The dark woodwork was beautiful. The door to the men's lounge was the original entrance. The hall was lined with posters, photos, and early menus. The old bar was arch shape, and the adjourning rooms overlooked a creek. We counted five dining rooms, and four of them were quite full on this Friday evening. 
We eat out a lot, and we will drive again from the east side to the west side to enjoy the fine dining offered at White Oak."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"The food was very good--Six of us arrived and waited and waited for the table in the back to be cleared for us. That area was good and not too loud. We ordered the soup or salad and half sandwich for $13. We each took a bite of the white chocolate Key Lime pie. Yum!  The cheese grits, clam chowder, and wedge salad were delicious. 

But the staff were running crazy. No smiles or hellos.  Seemed unorganized, like they didn't have assigned duties.  The hostess disappeared. The AC was on blast and employees kept going out the side door without closing it. Girls were hauling ice up from the basement. Our waiter did everything right, but something was off...

I missed the beautiful Art Deco decor and artwork of the former restaurant. The warm old bar is gone. As usual the entry way and bar area is tight. The restaurant seems brighter and needs wall hanging for color and warmth. Hopefully this place gets organized and the manager makes an appearance to his patrons."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"This restaurant and venue is par!  So happy that Twinsburg has a nice venue named after the twin founders of the community. Love the windows that overlook the Glen Eagles Golf Course. When you walk in the front door walk straight back to Aaron and Moses. It's not big or small. The size is just right. Two tables are high tops with tall chairs that we put together for our group of twelve. Happy Hour!  From 4-6 p.m. a limited menu is available. Most items are $5. Beer and wine and some fancy drinks are $5. So $10 spent on a food item and drink is wonderful!  We enjoyed the fried zucchini wedges, the Jerk chicken soft tacos, and wings. A full menu with many GF options is available. On the side is a long full bar with lots of stools. This place is relaxing. Will try the patio after a golf game. In the front part of the building are conference/party/special occasion areas. Reservations are now being taken for Mother's Day brunch. Put this place on your list to visit."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Went on Cleveland's Take a Hike and was given a 10% off coupon for Chop. Being just down the street we decided to try it, tho we were wearing shorts. We went into the bar and took a booth. Everything was great. We were dressed fine for a late Wednesday evening. There is beautiful bar room and a large lovely dining room with a dining balcony. We had just missed Happy Hour which ends at 7, and those prices looked really good. We got service right away. The menu included pricy steaks, burgers and salads. There were a lot of really good sounding appetizers that could make a meal. The hamburger was big and tasty with blue cheese, arugula and fried onion sticks on top. The Brussels sprouts I chose for a side were crispy and delicious. The side salad was bigger than we expected with shredded cheese on top. And the crab cake was perfect in size and flavor. I was afraid the prices were going to be too high end, but there was a delicious meal for all sizes of wallets. Enjoy!"
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Been here several times. Service is always good and friendly. Last Saturday morning at 8:30 the two rooms were filling up. One room had a group of 10 and other customers. Only two waitresses were on duty, so they were way short of help. At 9 a.m. three more employees walked in. Thank goodness. The waitresses did tell us they'd get to everyone. They kept the cups filled. Once the orders were given the meals did come out quickly. 

I noticed that Denny's does take-out breakfast. One customer picking up said that the orange juice cup was not a large. (I thought it was plenty big. Juice isn't soda pop.)  The cashier lady said that juice comes in one size. Well, that wasn't explained on the phone, the lady said. (Would it had made a difference since she didn't like the large size? She could purchased a second or buy a carton at the store.) Anyway....

Kudos to the two waitresses working the floor at 8:30. They did their best. Customers also were patient. Just don't be in a hurry."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Good bar food awaited us after our visit to The Christmas Story house. Thank goodness for our reservation. This blue collar dive has been cleaned up as it is the only restaurant in the neighborhood unless you drive a few blocks north into Tremont shopping area. The food was excellent. Nine girlfriends sat at the bar. You read it here!  That was our reserved spot, and it was all right!  The bartender/servers were pleasant and had all orders spot on. We enjoyed the Southwestern salad with chicken and huge tortilla strips. The Reuben was huge and wonderful. The meatloaf entree had plenty of good loaf, green beans and yummy risotto. And the meatloaf sandwich on sourdough with crispy fries was delish!  The craft beer list was one of the best ever with Local brews. The Platform Caramelicious Stout on draft was really good. Check the small cooler by the bar for cans. Being a party of nine, gratuity was added to the bill. I like this place. Remember to call first to check the wait time."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Another delicious meal in this wonderful restaurant. This is a nice place with an almost psychedelic decor of a former coffee shop. The walls are completely painted with suns, swirls, people, interesting designs. It's wild, and is unique to anywhere else. There is an open kitchen that you can watch the chefs move around. We shared a bowl of lobster bisque. This is the best having a thick cream and chucks of lobster and lots of rich flavor. The menu is heavy on fish and seafood, hence the name, and includes chicken and pasta. Tonight, the pork chop was perfect on a bed of cheesy mashed potatoes and seasoned zucchini. The Pho was a large bowl of noodles, veggies and a choice of meats or fish. We chose the fish--salmon, haddock, and shrimp. Delicious. Wine and beer are on the menu, and you can byob for a $5 corkage charge.  Service is good. There are two rooms if you have a group of ten or so. The venue isn't big, it's just right. It has a lot of punch. Patio. Parking. Reservations suggestioned.  Check the website for dinner hours."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Four stars. Really. This upscale restaurant is rustic and unique in a special way. The decor is fabulous. You feel like you're dining in a cabin in the woods. Owls, snowy boughs of evergreens, and little white lights are so welcoming. Be sure to take in this scenery. My group sat in the front semi-private room. It was a happy place. The food was good, tho expensive, most items starting at $14 for a lunch portion.  I had the eggplant special. I received a lunch portion of thin eggplant slices rolled and filled with Italian cheeses covered in marinara. Where was the greenery? A small side of veggies would have topped off this dish for the $14. The server was pleasant and got the orders right, except for a delayed order of a glass of wine. Take a walk through the ""cabin."" It's made up of several rooms with the same decor.  Parking is off Garfield, or turn into the second drive for a large parking lot in the back and enter through the rear door. This is a perfect spot for romantic dinners and business dinners. Check the website for information."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Pleasantly surprised. We liked this restaurant!  Tho the front facade is under construction, the restaurant is open and doing well. I was the only one who hadn't been here. We were celebrating a birthday. The service and food was outstanding!  The decor is formal, and includes a full bar, perfect for a romantic moment. The prices were very good, and we all brought half our large dinners home. The veal Saltimbocca $22 was outstanding and the most expensive of what my family ordered. As I was served I could smell the wine sauce. The large mushrooms and escarole in the sauce over the lightly breaded veal was Wow. Other delicious entrees we had were veal Sinatra, chicken Oscar, chicken Sicilian, chicken Parmagiana. The wedding soup was good, as well as apps stuffed mushrooms and eggplant Rollatini. The red marinara is tangy, not sweet. Most entrees include a salad and side of pasta and bread with their signature spread. I substituted a cup of wedding soup for the salad. We were very pleased. This may be our new spot located on Mayfield Road, next to the Party Store."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"T-Bones is top drawer in all aspects. Reservations are suggested. Located in the casino just outside the Red Rock Resort doors, the restaurant is beautiful. High ceilings and windows open up the room. The bar is big with bottles displayed to the ceiling. The white table clothed dining area is large with a fire place in the center. Service is A+. The manager stopped by our table and chatted. Our servers were professional and pleasant, not stuffy. The menu has ""reasonably"" priced appetizers and side dishes. Steaks and fish dishes are pricey. Everything we had was perfect, therefore delicious. Following comments by Yelpers we chose the large meaty crab cakes to start--the best. Oysters were not salty. The French onion soup could have been a meal. The prime rib was large and red rare in the middle and medium on the outside. We all had a mouth-watering taste. We could have shared it. The Dover sole was reminiscent of many meals in Belgium. Outstanding. The sides to share that we chose were creamed spinach and roasted sweet potatoes. A perfect compliment to our meals. We finished with coffees from a nice selection."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"This is the third Round House I have been to, and I think they are spectacular.  These are working rail yards by railroad veterans that have a passion to preserve the past.  The buildings are from the turn of the century, and the train cars and locomotives are old, too.  Our guide, Charley, was very informative, and had a passion for this hobby.  He told us the history, stories of rail activity, and what happens with the rail yard's paranormal activity.  The round house has a huge locomotive in it that is being restored.  The wheels are 60 inches.  I had no idea that a 1943 engine could be so big.  We saw the turntable and learned that at one time there were 15 doors.  We sat in and learned about a caboose, a restored passenger car and a Pullman car which was beautiful in a vintage way. The area is rough.  The dirt and grime has been there for over one hundred years.  This is not a place for little kids, but others will certainly enjoy it.  Closed-toe shoes are a must.  Check the website for hours and special events and tours. There is a dirt/gravel parking lot in this working area below Tremont in the steel yards."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Been by this so many times that we decided to stop on a snowy Saturday around 2 p.m. Was pleasantly surprised. The venue is newer, and was the cleanest place I think I have ever been in.  Spotless!  Even the bathrooms. We started with a late lunch.  Wasn't busy so we got seated at a high-top right away. The server was professional and the food was delicious. We had checked the menu before we arrived, and it was spot on. The fried chicken sandwich with blue cheese was great....I substituted the fries for a nice salad.  The BBQ shredded pork sandwich was very good. My husband got the chicken Cobb salad, and said it was outstanding. Even the blueberry pie milk shake was delicious, but could have been a few ounces more for the price. We opted for no alcohol. Then we played the Arcade.  Fun! We were a middle age couple with our Millennial son, and we had a blast. Had a $20 game card that you slide--no tokens, and that's all we needed. Played skeet ball, basketball, drove race cars, played air hockey and a few other games. Lots of choices. And you can choose a prize. This place is perfect for a date night, or kids time, or just to eat, or just to play."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"We had to try this buffet because the reviews were all over the place. And having been to super large buffets before we knew that this one had to be good. We LIKED this one. We walked in on a Saturday at  4 p. m., and were seated right away. The area was clean. The staff was friendly. Long food stands contain all kinds of food including a few Mexican and Indian dishes. There is all the crab legs and shrimp. Prime rib and turkey were at the carving station.  These counters were clean. Food was refreshed when pans were low. The food was very good and tasty.  Of the foods the Mexican, being mostly tortillas wraps looked dry and needed to be refreshed with tomato sauce. I tried three small cake pieces and they too were dry. Other desserts included cookies, puddings and blue Hawaiian ice cream!  A special perk was that beer and wine came with the meal. You do get your own drinks. The tables are bussed regularly to keep the area clean. Be sure to get a free MGMLife card at the service desk for a meal discount and others. For the reviewers with negative comments, spend more money elsewhere and see if the food is a whole lot better. Vegas is a Casbah and a food Mecca."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"I finally experienced the talk of Chagrin Falls.  We walked around and looked at every piece of this gorgeous venue.  We called for a 4:30 reservation for Happy Hour, and were asked to come at 4. We did, tho when we left on a warm Tuesday evening, only a few tables had customers. More people were coming in when we departed at 6. We learned that HH is at the white porcelain bar only, which is long with lots of chairs. The menu foods were no different than the regular menu. Drinks were a few dollars less. We sat on the deck which was lovely. We all ordered ""shared"" dishes for our meals which are the appetizers. The Sapphire Burger is a salmon pattie on a bun with fries. The salmon looked over cooked, but tasted good. The ahi tuna tartar was creamy with avocado and served with delicate lotus chips. Very good. The chicken meatballs (5) were tasty with a light sweet-sour sauce. The king crab spring rolls were delicious.  The wine flights were very nice being three 2-oz pours. The beer on tap that day was Kentucky Bourbon Ale. The selection changes often. I like this venue. I'll need to try it again. Just wish there were HH reduced food prices on the apps, and allowed at the tables."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Update:  Went here on a rainy Friday night. Wanted to valet the truck for $10. There was only one runner, so we had to wait a while as there were several cars. He parked the truck on the street and gave us our keys since he would be gone before we finished. That was considerate. Upon entering I saw an open table by a window and we got it!  We ordered a delicious chocolate martini and another Young's Double Chocolate Stout--my favorite. Waiter was great. Flatbread, French onion soup and salad was very good. I like this venue. 

Went here after a walking tour of the Civic area. We were seated right away, and surprise!  Leon, who was our excellent waiter at last visit, was our waiter again!  Request him!  He made suggestions, answered our questions, was patient. My girl friend ordered her first ever chocolate martini after Leon told her about the top three favorites. I ordered Young's Double Chocolate stout which was, strangeserved cold in a warm glass which Leon explained. Both drinks were fabulous! The salad and flatbread were delicious. The prices are the best of anywhere for dinner. We split the bill, which was nicely divided in half. Chocolate Bar has become a favorite restaurant."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Decided to head out to the East Bank and check out the venue. I heard it was a fun place for events. We went for an early dinner before a concert, about  5:30 p.m. We walked around for a while seeing the games to play. We saw pinball, bowling, shuffle board and darts. Finally, we were seated. The whole experience took a while. We ordered drinks.  After ten minutes the waitress came over and told me that the bar had no coconut milk or coconut water. So I reordered. While waiting too long I decided to see what was upstairs. There is a 21 and over roof-top bar.  It's a full size bar with a few tables and chairs so it looked like a stand-up place. When I went back downstairs we still waited for our order. Our waitress kindly told us that we would receive our food soon. After 45-total minutes we were served. Surprisingly, at this point the chicken tacos were in a hand-size flour shell and were delicious. The cocoa dusted tacos were in small corn tortillas. They were very good, tho too small. We enjoyed the food. The service was fine. The organization of the bar, kitchen placement, the waitresses running a round, and the long wait for tacos at an early time we thought could be a management problem."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Very nice better family restaurant on Rt. 91, just north on Mayfield Rd. in the shopping center.  Check it out. It has a vibe of family gatherings and special celebrations. We went on a Thursday evening, and we were seated in the restaurant that was in full swing, and we didn't have a reservation. I saw a full bar. One lady brought our water right away, and explained the dinner specials. Our waitress brought menus and took our drink order. Then the bread and olive oil with Parmesan arrived. We ordered, and the wait was short to receive our meals. We were so hungry that I forgot to take pictures, but the food was delicious. The menu lists many substitutions for different salads, meats and pastas. Some were a few dollars more. House salads started the meal with apps of stuffed peppers and calamari. The calamari was okay. It could have been a bit crispier. One entree was the Cobb salad. This salad was the largest Cobb I've ever seen. The Penne Arrabiata was good. I had a Veal Parmesan in a marinara with pasta on the side. Lots of meals were pasta, but fish, chicken, shrimp, and other items were listed, including zucchini noodles. The meals were so large that we all took part of it home. So two meals for a reasonable price of one."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"I had been looking to my first dining experience in this old bank building. It's beautiful. But the acoustics are bad. If you're hard of hearing you'll have a difficult time. Four stars for slow service at the beginning, and we couldn't hear the waitress. 

We were a party of 14. That number of people should require two servers. Apparently there was a staff shortage, because our waitress seemed to be working a lot of tables. A male waiter saved the day. He kept the water glasses full, served the dishes and cleared the table appropriately. He was very friendly answering questions. But staffing is a manager's concern. We were there one hour too long. 

Despite a slow start, the food was delicious!  The popular short ribs were not a menu item, but the nightly special. Everyone seemed pleased. The tomato-basil soup was tasty. The beet salad was hardy. The tempura oyster app was good, tho I was expecting the rice batter, and I only tasted an oyster once or twice. The lobster agnolotti needed more lobster, but was good, I was told. The mushroom risotto was the best. So we liked the food. 

Kind of the manager to give us complimentary desserts due to the long wait time. Save room for all the cakes. They looked divine. I must say that the creme brûlée was the best I've ever had. Nice flavor."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"First time visit for lunch on a Friday. The place was busy as the parking was nearly full. If your party is more than four I would recommend making a reservation. Hours are 11:30 to 2:30. Then dinner hours are from 5 to 10 p.m. We were given a high-top, but took a table by the window. The atmosphere is fresh, modern and bright. This is a better Italian-American restaurant, and attire is nice casual or dressy. The lunch menu included salads, sandwiches, paninis and pizza. A variety of apps and soups, such as calamari, and white bean and tomato soups, could start the meal. Our wait staff was very good. Our main waiter explained the menu with a smile and gave the two specials. One was a salmon entree with veggies for $21. The other was a no-meat burger with truffle chips for $14. Then he brought out bread and olive oil. Our meals were delicious. One was a half panini and soup for $12. One was a pizza enough for two--$15. I tried the no-meat burger. The patty came out as a hamburger with everything on it. The patty had a nice grilled flavor and had a meat texture. I couldn't tell it was vegetarian. The truffle chips tasted homemade and were crisp and I ate all of them, even shared a few. This venue definitely competes with other nice restaurants from Chagrin Falls to Eton Mall. It's very nice."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Big, crowded, busy and loud!  We entered to the waiting room and went to the bar to do eight one-ounce wine tastings for $8. The wines are preselected. Instead of going back and forth through the crowd to get the next glass, I ordered a glass of a Prosecco so I could visit with friends. Hubby went to the other bar to get a beer. After 15 minutes I went looking for him. The walk-up crowd at the bar wasn't getting service. Perhaps the bar was understaffed for the busy place, or someone wasn't assigned to attend the walk-ups. We had placed our reservation weeks earlier for twenty of us. We got there at 6 to enjoy the tasting and were seated at 7. We had tables of 10, 6, and a booth of four. Because the place was super busy and we wanted to keep our waitress, we skipped the apps and ordered entrees when our drinks came. We are so glad we did.  We finished eating and visiting at 9 o'clock. One of the other tables hadn't been served apps let alone their entrees. They were very unhappy. I don't know if they had our waitress or if the group was unorganized. We had good service. The food was good, tho a few dollars expensive. 
This place is fun and different. This is one of those venues that you need the right people to work the large and loud crowd. Make your reservation a week early, and make an evening of it."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"Decided to eat Mediterranean on a cold rainy evening around 7 p.m. We walked in and chose our booth. The place didn't get busy until about 8 or so. Our waitress explained the menu. We got the two sampler platters for the four of us. The hummus, baba ganouj, and tabouli were fresh and delicious. The falafel was a bit dry, but still good. We ate by scooping with flat bread, and the waitress was nice to bring us forks. Tho smoothies are on the menu they were not available, so we drank bottled water for $1 each. Glasses of ice were brought to us. Then it was Hookah time!  One friend had smoked hookah in the Middle East so we all decided to try it. We were pleasantly surprised. We chose the lemon mint flavor coals, and the rest was easy. Disposable mouth pieces were given to us. You suck as vapor filled your mouth. We did not swallow, but opened our mouths to release the vapor. We laughed, since we were doing something new. The table next to ours was a group of guys playing cards with a hookah on the table. So all was good. The dining room is large with a large dance floor. The walls have a eclectic mixture of Middle Eastern decor. We met the owners who are a family from Jordan. There is a bakery connected next door. We got the baklava and a couple of veggie sandwiches for later. We enjoyed this cultural experience, and will definitely go back."
8g_iMtfSiwikVnbP2etR0A,"""Almost perfect"" sums up our dining experience at this quaint hideaway that you forget where you are.  There are no reservations unless there are six or more people. So we walked in at 5:30 on a cold evening and the small dining room was nearly full. We were seated at our choice of the two remaining tables. An hour later a few tables were ready for the second wave. Service was professional. We were offered to sample the wine before we purchased a glass. The blanc was too citrusy, and the Riesling was just right. When asked if we'd like bread, and was told that the butter contained blue cheese, we said, yes!  Was a good taste with the wine. Salad was not the favorite arugula like described, but the thin spiny lettuce leaves that are difficult to eat--disappointing. For entrees we both chose the ""seafood"" crepes--a hardy portion of fish, perhaps salmon, wrapped in crepes with a delicious béchamel sauce, a side of veggies al dente and an edible flower!  Mmm. Outstanding. Dessert was Madame Spring's lemon pie, tart and tasted like Key Lime, and Pot de crème--a demitasse cup of a chocolate mousse-like mixture with fresh crème on top. Taste buds were happy. Plus, the water glasses were kept full. Receipt and tip suggestions were on an iPad--I prefer to figure the tip. Be aware that tax is included in the tip amounts. Our dining experience was during the Chagrin Valley Restaurant week, an excellent way to enjoy fine dining for less. Check out Paris Room's live music starting Wednesdays, and happy hour is at the bar."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"Went here on Saturday night and had a really great meal!  I'll start with the negative to get it out of the way.  Really, the only critical thing that I can say about Fat Cats is that despite a reservation, we still had to wait 15 minutes. I guess it wouldn't have been so bad if a) we weren't starving, and b) I didn't have out-of-town in-laws that I wanted to impress.

But the experience only got better from the time we sat down. Everyone was great to us, even though it was majorly crowded at first. My mother-in-law is an extremely picky eater who really would always want to go to a chain restaurant in order to get her salad & soup combo, or something really small, or something meat-and-potatatoey that she can share with somebody. She was really happy here because of...what did she call it? The ""local flavor"" or something like that. She was surprised to see fare other than burgers and ""sammies"" on the menu.

Anyway, she was very happy with her alaskan halibut. The fact that she and my father-in-law shared it did not make the server flinch at all (unlike the way they gave them ""that look"" the previous night at another restaurant). 

I had the spinach and leek soup, which was creamy, tasty, and filling. It came with a crostini overflowing with the same olive tapenade that they bring to the table with olive oil & vinegar for the bread. Delicious - so much so that I could hardly eat my main course, the rigatoni with olives, onions, fresh tomato sauce, and lake erie creamery feta. So good!

My husband had the arugula salad and then the duck entree, which he really enjoyed. We also  shared some great egg rolls to start.

And oh, can't forget about dessert. If you come here and consider skipping it, DON'T. Get the fallen chocolate cake (served with vanilla ice cream and a port-wine sauce) or the peanut butter cheesecake (topped with grape jam and drizzled with chocolate sauce). Even my in-laws, who were gabbing about Weight Watchers all night, ate every bite.

I seem to remember the last time I came here (last summer) there wasn't a very large selection of beers on tap. Even though it's still not huge, they seem to have added a couple of good local choices.

Fat Cats is a great  mix of casual atmosphere with really delicious food. Everything I had surprised me, which is always good!"
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"Holy Foccacia, this food is great.

My husband kept showing off about going here for lunch with his work ""buddies."" However, he kept my snotty remarks at bay by always bringing me home his leftovers, including the eggplant and wild mushroom sandwich and a few slices of the thin-crust pizza (the ""Salumi"" with some kinds of Italian meats, sun-dried tomatoes, and some other stuff).

Today we decided to take an ""early bird dinner"" / ""late bird lunch"" trip over to the restaurant, because we were already in the area doing stuff. At first I thought I was underdressed - because the interior seems awfully nice for a place with ""Pizzeria"" in the name - but I quickly realized that we were just fine in our scrubby t-shirts and shorts.

Both the hostess and our waitress were extremely friendly, in a really genuine-seeming way.

The foccacia they bring you at the beginning is very good, with some sea salt sprinkled on there. We shared a full-size Caesar salad, and were able to get the dressing on the side, no problem. It was very refreshing and was served with chilled plates - a nice touch. Instead of croutons, there were thinly sliced crostini which were very crunchy and great dipped in the dressing.

I got the eggplant sandwich, which I'd enjoyed at home previously (and which is noted on their menu as a ""favorite"") and my husband got the spicy calamari. My sandwich was friggin' heavenly. It was crunchy, greasy in all the right places, and served with PIPING hot marinara (I'm telling you, this sauce did not stop steaming for ten minutes. I've never seen sauce stay hot that long!). The sandwich had fried eggplant slices, wild mushrooms, tomatoes, provolone cheese, and was served on what else...? Foccacia. Oh joy! Yet it didn't leave me feeling like I just ate a brick.

You can choose a side (like I really needed anything else?) of a cannelini bean salad; fries; or soup. I had the bean salad, which also had just the right amount of pesto as well as roasted red peppers. I was extremely happy with this.

We got some decadent-looking cupcakes for later, including one with a chocolate ganache atop marshmallow buttercream, as well as one with malted milk balls on top.

I might sound like a lunatic, but even the diet coke tasted great here.

Everything was affordable, and I can't wait to go back."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I'm a huge fan of Cerino's in Broadview Heights, and I also really enjoyed Eddie 'N Eddie. I had no doubts that Cerino's Casual Italian would be good at what it does. I guess I understand why Eddie 'N Eddie had to go. And aside from Peppers (and I guess Angelos, and some other small pizzerias), there isn't a lot of casual Italian in Lakewood. I'd consider Cerino's to be a little bit more elevated than just ""casual,"" in fact. There's something about the space that is more than just that old, mom & pop place. I love those types of places, I really do. But sometimes you just need a little bit of space and a modern touch. 

Anyway, that's all about the idea of this place and the reputation that Eddie holds. However, I was a little disappointed with my takeout experience. I know, it's not the same as dining in. But the baked ziti was very bland. I was surprised, actually. There was plenty of fresh basil, the cheese was good and the pasta was cooked well, but a little more salt & pepper could have brought this dish to another level. (**Edited to add ""duh realization moment"": I ordered it without the sausage. So obviously the sausage would have added more flavor. So, I guess my suggestion would be to do something to the vegetarian version of this dish to balance it out a bit.**)

My husband loved his cortini dish -- and so did I. This had pulled pork, ricotta, and other stuff. It was delicious. In contrast to the underseasoned ziti dish, the bread they provided with the order was overly salty. I'm usually a bread beast, but I only had once piece.

Also, I had ordered a salad, and even after confirming the order over the phone and again when I picked up, it wasn't in the bag. I called and they were unable to refund the charge for the salad on my credit card for some reason, so they gave me a ""credit"" for a salad next time I come in. I was like, ""So, you're just gonna write down my name, and you'll know?"" I guess we'll see how organized they are about this sort of thing. If I were them, I might have either a) sent someone out to deliver my salad (I live in Lakewood, 5 mins away), or b) I would have gotten my email address or home address and sent a gift card, just to ensure that it wouldn't be lost in the insanity that is a new(ish) restaurant.

Because I have always had a great experience at the other Cerino locations (and great feedback from Eddie himself), I'll certainly give this place another try soon."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I've been putting off writing this review, because I wanted to make sure that I was clear-headed (in other words, well- rested and not excessively cranky) enough to write it to the best of my ability. So, here goes.

Greenhouse Tavern provided me with one of the best dining experiences of my entire life! I can count on one hand the times I've had a truly memorable, delicious, well- rounded, eclectic meal with superb food and drink in a unique environment. (Other places in CLE that fit this description include the W.6th Crop, Dante, and the now-closed Bar Symon (R.I.P., pork cracklins).

Derek and I went here for our third wedding anniversary. A night off from the world of high chairs and smushed banana is a plus to begin with, but add to that a warm, beautifully decorated atmosphere, attentive staff, and mouth-watering food, and you've got me paying attention.

We decided to each get the tasting menu at $44 apiece. Soooo worth it, because we got a three courses as well as a choice of either a half or dessert. Although the Animal frites sounded remarkably heart- attack provoking, and therefore awesome, I decided to go for the dessert.

Here's what we got.

Me: beet salad, goat pasta, Ohio beef burger, Dobos torte.

Him: bacon-wrapped apples, duck pasta, and a WHOLE BEEF SHIN. Yes, it was ridiculous, and I'm including pictures. People were staring and laughing. (Possibly pointing too.) we ate that delectable, tender pot roast for a whole week. Did I mention they included the bone? Six pounds in all. And yes, we took the bone home too. To add insult to injury, he got the buttered popcorn pot du creme for dessert.

Everything was amazing. My only criticism was that the fries that came with my burger were way too salty. But everything else was great.

I love the extensive beer list, the kinda-casual, but still trendy, atmosphere (because there's only a handful of days out of the year when I can pretend to be trendy, and I kinda wanna fit in), and the bottle of water that remained on the table for us to refill our glasses, even though it wasn't really needed, because we got refills from the servers approximately once every eight minutes.but it was a nice thought.

I will fantasize about this meal for months, and when I return, I probably won't be as impressed, because I'm negative and cynical like that. But I'm glad that I have this memory in my mind of Greenhouse, and I'd like for it to stay there for quite some time."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"This was an unexpected (well, ok, kinda expected based on high reviews) treat and I am so glad I came!

Derek and I stopped in for an impromptu ""date lunch"" yesterday. We were in that very rare but coveted place in time where our daughter was at daycare but we both happened to be home because we were preparing to go out of town. So we decided to give this place a try because a) I had heard great things, and b) it seemed unassuming, fairly expedient, and low-maintenance (three things we were looking for out of our lunch yesterday).

When we saw the small interior and ""takeout' atmosphere, we thought, wrongly so, that we would have to place our order at the counter and bring it to a table. Nope! A really friendly guy came right over to us and asked if we were dining in, then offered us any available table. He came right over, went over the menu when we told him we were first-timers, and then quickly brought our drinks as we looked things over and decided what to order.

It was not an easy decision! But I went with the chicken arepa with regular seasoned fries, and my husband had the chorizo arepa with arepa fries. We decided not to get the cheesy corn, which I'm a little sad about, but as soon as all the food was brought to the table I realized there would have been no room for the cheesy corn (on the table or inside of us).

Everything was hot and wonderful. There was another very pleasant and cheerful waitress who brought us a variety of sauces and explained each one. I was a big fan of the ranchero, garlic, and the chimmichuri until I tasted the pineapple sauce. From that moment on, pineapple went on EVERYTHING. It was a big surprise because I don't usually go for pineapple with hot stuff (blame a particularly violent case of Montezuma's Revenge from eating a Hawaiian Pizza in Mexico). I tried not to finish everything .... it didn't work.

The fries were only ok. But the arepa is what stood out. The all-white corn tortilla was sturdy, crispy, and a welcome reprieve from either regular thin tortillas or regular bread. It was a great experience. Next time we come back, we're going to share an arepa and the cheesy corn. (Although I'd really be interested to try the empanadas as well...)

Note: to me, it wasn't a great place for kids because it was a bit cramped in there. However, they were friendly toward a couple who came in with a two-year old and they brought out a highchair for her. So, it is an option for those of you who are debating it."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"A cool, perfect summer night led me and my husband over to the Pub. We were in the area and I had never been there before, though he had on more than one occasion to watch World Cup and to get his beer on.

I like how there are three sort of disparate sections to this place. There's the swanky, carpeted, quiet dining area; the black-and-white checkered floor area with booths surrounding the (humongous) bar; and the lively, family-laden outdoor patio space. We were seated outside (our choice) by a tall blond guy in a kilt. Now that's service.

Being a Monday, there was this cool trivia quiz going on. We came too late to get involved, but it seemed pretty fun with questions that weren't obnoxiously obscure, yet not too easy either. Some examples were: What was Nemo's dad's name in Finding Nemo? A cynophobe is afraid of what animal? The Wailing Wall is in what city? etc. They also had a lightening round, where players had a list of oft-used quotes from old TV shows and had to identify which shows they came from, as well as a music round, where 10 snippets of semi-popular songs had to be identified along with their artists. I would like to drag a group of Yelpers here on a Monday because I am certain we would friggin' dominate.

The food was awesome. BUT we didn't order gourmet. I knew walking in to have very low expectations. This was going to be one of my last ""I'm pregnant; I am going to eat a crappy comfort food meal"" experiences. SO: fried pickles and fish and chips it was.

The fried pickles were just .. (sorry Brandon) AMAZING. And there were six spears! They were piping hot, crispy, and came with a great ranch-type sauce. Much better than those at Buckeye, although I like those too.

Now, I really should say that I only order fish and chips from a place like this..a ""British pub.""  However authentic or inauthentic that actually is for this place, it doesn't really matter. I knew the fish and chips were going to be great, and they were. Huge chunk of cod or whatever it was, with a thick batter. There was definitely a great proportion of fish to breading too - it wasn't overwhelmed by the batter, which is great. The chips were much less appealing than the fish. In fact, I hated the fries. Doesn't mean I didn't eat 'em, though!

My husband had the same meal as I did, and also enjoyed one of their MANY tapped beers (the bastard). I am certain that I will be adding the Pub to my ""Beer Buddies"" list just as soon as I can get a cold one down my gullet again."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I wasn't overly impressed with Sacred Hour.

I came recently to their newer location. First of all, it was impossible to even find the entrance and there's no rear entry (HE-llo), so I parked in the exact wrong spot for the building. Something that would have probably been nice to know when booking the appointment: the best place to park and/or enter the building.

Once inside, I almost laughed (-slash-vomited from claustrophobia). The ""lobby"" was seriously a box. There was another guy in there and if there were just one more person waiting, it would have been seriously uncomfortable. I will say that the woman at the front desk was very kind, offered to take my coat, etc. In fact, all of the staff at Sacred Hour were wonderful. It's just the space that was not so comfortable. In a place where you're going to be soothed, pampered and relaxed, the atmosphere didn't really help. I mean, it was decorated well. The lighting and music were nice. But it was tiny tiny tiny.

Once checked in, I was brought to the waiting area, which was also ridiculously cramped and small. There was a choice of two places to sit. When I chose the lounge-type chair, I soon realized that the fountain on the table next to me was splashing me with water, so I moved to the other couch. I was offered water, which was deliciously cucumber-esque, but there was nowhere to put it while trying to read one of the magazines they set out. A little bit frustrating.

The masseuse came to greet me after about five minutes, and brought me directly across the hall to a room that wasn't super small, but only because there were two beds inside. The room was closed off only by a curtain, which made me feel a bit self-conscious as I undressed, because I could see out of it through the side. (Not that anyone would be looking, but still, I like the comfort of a door.) I kind of wish that the lights were a little more dimmed than they were. The music was great though.

I had a 75-minute relaxation massage, but to tell you the truth, I'm wondering if this masseuse more regularly does deep tissue. It wasn't that it was too hard, per se, because I kept thinking, ""Should I tell her to ease up?"" It was just the way she was kneading the muscles that was quite uncomfortable at times. I guess I just didn't really enjoy it.

She was very nice, though, and you can tell that they try to make this studio look good and seem better than it actually is. Not to sound like a snob, but I guess I just like a spacious spa with lockers, showers, robes, and, I don't know ... room to walk."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"This was the first Mexican joint I went to upon moving to Cleveland.  I had high expectations after reading the menu online; plus, it came recommended.

The first half of this meal would have gotten a 5-star review; the second half, 1 star.

We were greeted instantly and seated outside without a wait, which is always a plus.  Our waiter came right away; he was a bit ""affected"" and disinterested, which always rubs me the wrong way in restaurants.

We ordered drinks (sangria and some fruit-blended margarita).  The sangria was, in my mind, not as sweet as at Farenheit, but not as dry as at Prosperity.  But, unilke other Goldilocks tales, this did not make it Just Right....instead, it was Just OK.  (My husband was drooling over his margarita, though.)

We ordered the guacamole sampler, which, as a previous review mentioned, was way too much food for two people, but all three varieties (original, goat cheese/tomato, and crab) tasted wonderful (we ignored the fact that we hadn't actually ordered the goat cheese/tomato but some other flavor.  Whatever.).  However, this is where it starts to go wrong.

You'd think that when the main focus of the table is the guacamole, they would pay attention to the refilling of the chips.  Nope.  After one basket, that was it.  We waited ten minutes before someone came over to even take the main order.  Then we also asked for more chips.  Nope.  Waiting, and more waiting.  It was like we were invisible...and it's not like the place got extremely crowded.  Finally, halfway through our main courses, a busboy noticed that we had stopped eating and brought us more chips.  We ended up taking them, and the remaining guacamole, home...although, who wants to eat day-old guacamole?

This wouldn't have been so bad, though, if the dinner itself wasn't really, really bad.  I got the tilapia tacos, and they were just unappealing: soggy, with slimy peppers and onions and a REALLY fishy taste that isn't usually present in tilapia I've eaten.  Even though there wasn't much food in the entree, I didn't finish it.  This is saying a lot for me, because I usually power through Mexican food like a bulldozer.  Oh well.

The waiter finally resurfaced to clear our plates and again took forever with the check.  I think that, despite all the food weirdness, the service is what really struck me about what's wrong with this place.  Unfriendly and ""too cool.""

But, because this was only our first visit, we've decided to go back another time...maybe just for guacamole?  Would it be tacky to bring our own bag of chips? ;)"
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I can't really explain my obsession with Milio's.  But I'll try.

By the way, if halfway through this, you realize that I am crazy and you don't want to hear any more, please feel free to stop reading.

I guess it's not only that I have this thing about cold sandwiches.  It's also the fact that there have been specific situations in which I had said sandwiches from Milio's that made them work for me.  By the way, this location in Monona is my favorite, because it was close to work (and Caribou coffee), but I have also had sandwiches from the ones on State Street as well as in Waunakee, and, not surprisingly, the results were almost identical.  It is a chain, after all.

The first time was when I was  at an all-day music recital with other teachers, and we were STARVING, and our boss was like, ""I'll order something.  Milio's?""  I didn't even have the wherewithal to disagree, because I was so deliriously hungry, but when that sandwich was delivered to me, on a whole wheat bun, with lettuce, tomato, turkey, provolone, and SPROUTS....NOM NOM!  I thought it was the best thing in the entire world.

The next time was after I had run a 20K race in Monona.  The only thing I could think about from miles 10-12 were a Vanilla Light Cooler from Caribou, and a Milio's sandwich.  Good thing they are right next door to each other.

The third time was when I was moving.  Moving sucks, packing sucks, finding food to eat when you've packed everything to cook with sucks.  To Milio's I went.  And it was glorious.

I can't believe that Milio's is only a Wisconsin thing.  (Well, they also have them in Iowa, Nebraska, and Minnesota.  Yeah, I checked the website.)  I am mad. Very mad.  Jimmy John's is not the same.  No whole-wheat bread unless you want a regular sandwich and not a sub.  Hell naw!  I guess they have sprouts, but...meh.  I will deal with it.  But it ain't Milio's.

My husband thinks I'm crazy.  He hates Milio's, Jimmy John's, Subway, and everything like it.  He'll only order a cold sandwich if he goes to a Little Italy neighborhood and gets one with all the Italian meats and cheeses. 

My husband likes Quiznos, which I think is because they toast their sandwiches.  I hate Quiznos.  I once went there because I couldn't get to Milio's, and asked for the sandwich cold...and....not a good sandwich.   The toasting totally masks the fact that their bread sucks!.  

He just doesn't understand my obsession with Milio's.  I don't blame him, really, because Milio's is like the cold version of McDonald's.  But I don't care.  Thank you for your time."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"This place is great.  It has an EXTENSIVE, eclectic menu with several different types of cuisine.  Its originality--from the steel clipboard menus to the long table in the middle of the room keeping your beverages chilled in large bowls of ice--is what makes it stand out.  The food is great, too.

The fact that it is literally on my street corner is not the best part about Parallax, but it's probably the best part about living where I do.

I've had a number of different appetizers: duck spring rolls (yummmmm), different salads (the seaweed/squid one is amazing), edamame (just the right amount of salt).  However, I know I might be lame in saying so, but I've only ever had their sushi as a main course, because I love sushi so much, and this is the only place around that does it decently (or maybe at all; haven't found any other Japanese restaurants here yet).  The maki combo (spicy tuna, cucumber, california) is plentiful and well worth the $13 price tag.  Other items on the menu might seem a bit expensive.

Other big hits from family include the grilled salmon with garlic crust and creamed corn, the arctic char with sesame seed crust and Japanese mayo, and the monkfish osso bucco.  

Desserts are, like the rest of the menu items, a bit avant-garde; cheescake (with grapefruit infused crust) was a small, but filling, disc sitting in a pool of sugary-sweet sauce; the Napoleon was a deconstructed, open-on-all-sides tower of airy wafers and rice cream.  The sorbet/ice cream helpings are very generous, and you can mix and match.  Haven't tried the Greek yogurt with honey and fresh berries, because that sounds more like breakfast food to me, but I might one day because it sounds so appetizing.

Even something as minor as the way my tea was served deserves mentioning: the waitress brought out a wooden box of specialty teas in silken pouches, and then, once I had chosen one, she brought out the hot water in a nice-sized pot alongside a variety of sugars (LOVE the fact that they have natural sugar lumps you can drop into your tea or coffee!).  The pot held enough water for 2 1/2 - 3 cups of tea.

Each time we have been here, we got treated exceptionally well by the hostesses, bussers/breadpeople (did I mention they keep refilling the bread?!?  And they have specialty sea salt?  Love it!), and servers.  We also went here once just for drinks and dessert, and were treated just as well.

Overall, a great experience for something a little out of the ordinary.  If family is visiting, and they've been talking smack about Cleveland, take them here to shut them up."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I have only ever wanted to lick my plate one other time in the past year.

This restaurant is awesome! It is beautiful, everyone is totally professional and wonderful, and the food is exquisite.

I had a great view of the open kitchen from my comfy, velvet bench seat.

Everything we had was great. The bread itself was ridiculously good (rosemary and cheese biscuits? Hello.) The salads were full of fruit and flavor. I had a mixed greens plate with blackberries, strawberries, and local Swiss cheese with a vanilla balsamic dressing. Wow! I usually don't like Swiss cheese that much because it is too pungent, but this was mild and creamy. My husband had the grilled melon salad with proscuitto and a honey-lime vinagrette. He admired the way the meat was trimmed just enough for it not to be fatty, but still left a lot of the flavor. Both salads had a good deal of parsley on them, which added an unexpected depth.

My husband got the chicken and waffles. If you're into this sort of thing, GO TRY IT NOW!  It was delicious. I had the daily ""pasta pile,"" which tonight was whole-wheat fettuccine with a whole mess of other ingredients that went very well together (including shrimp, artichokes, peppers, bacon, and asiago cheese. It also had cooked nectarines in there, adding an unconventional sweetness.) I could only finish half.

Dessert was...indescribable, really. It was called the ""Pretzel Un-logic"" and was a sort of chocolate cream cake on a crust of pretzels, with some pretzels on top for a garnish, and salted caramel sauce drizzled all over the plate.  Hence the desire to lick said plate clean.

I almost forgot the ""Cropsicle,"" a palate cleanser brought to us between our salads and our main courses. It was a tiny round frozen ball of mango and ginger in a shot glass. Wonderful!

Unlike other meals we've had at ""nice restaurants"" in the area, Crop does not skimp on portion sizes! We had more than enough on our plates.

Also, I should mention that at Crop, Bromance runs deep. Not only were most of the diners large groups of businessmen in suits and/or guys on man-dates, but there seemed to be a great deal of chef-diner camaraderie. Chefs were just walking in and out of the kitchen patting guys on the back and seeing how things were doing.  One of the chefs came up to a table next to us with a complimentary tuna appetizer. When met with a confused look, he said to the guest, ""You're a friend of _______?"" And handshakes ensued. Guys were just spreading the man-love ALL over this restaurant. But let's face it. Who wouldn't love to be here? We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves too."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"The most impressed I've been with a restaurant in a long time. 

I'd been looking forward to trying Eddie 'N Eddie ever since I heard of its opening over the summer. I am a HUGE fan of Pizzeria Cerino, and was very excited about this new place in Lakewood (because it's not too often that I'm in Seven Hills). 

Plus, it's always important for me to find great, reliable restaurants that are not cookie-cutter chains, nor are they too upscale because we have kids. Eddie 'N Eddie strikes this balance excellently. Along with Deagan's (which I've been having problems with for a long time) and Jammy Buggars, this place is a good go-to for a weeknight or weekend late afternoon where you can feel not too self-conscious about your little ones, because the environment is loud. Plus, they have way above average food and good beer (and I guess bourbon, though I wouldn't know how to judge that).

We were there with our infant, 2-year-old, and another couple who also had an infant. They could not have been more accommodating. They put us in a corner with more than enough room but which was out of the way. This was great for two reasons: one, we didn't disturb other patrons. Two, we didn't feel as though we had to keep dodging servers walking by and worrying that the kids were going to get in the way.

Now for the food. I had a half roasted beet salad, which was great and very generous for a half-salad. A whole one could have definitely filled me up for dinner. We also tried the lettuce wraps, which were fine but would have been even better with some dipping sauce(s), as well as the cornbread -- served piping hot in a skillet, with orange marmalade and butter.

I couldn't NOT have the chicken pot pie, which was quite possibly the BEST pot pie ever! Flaky, buttery, soft crust, with huge chunks of white meat chicken, vegetables (not frozen peas and carrots, but real fresh veggies), and a delicious gravy that tasted unfamiliar, yet delicious. It wasn't that usual cornstarchy gravy you get in a pot pie.

My husband tried a chicken burger and it was great, and our friends got the Kentuckyaki burger and the E 'n E  burger. They were both able to get a whole-wheat bun instead of a white one. Also, the sides include any number of delicious things, not just fries (although that is one side). I did the half salad (+3.5) for my side, my husband did the sweet potato croquettes, others had the Italian wedding soup. All amazing.

Anyway, the service was really outstanding. Our waitress' name was Teresa and she deserves props! I loved this place and will be making a habit of coming here. Not pretentious, but not a soulless chain restaurant."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I love love love Lago!

I've been there three times.  Each time, we received exceptional service, great advice on wine, and, most importantly, delicious food.

I love the inside.  It's kinda dark and swanky, but it doesn't feel oppressively so.  I enjoy the water glasses--trivial, sure, but for me, little things like this make a difference--in their icy blue shade.  They are also not too heavy or big.

Pear Martini is the frickin' BOMB.  So is most of the wine we've tried.

Waitstaff is so friendly and gives you time to make up your mind.  They also realize that you're probably going to want more bread, and they ask you if you'd like it before you have to track someone down to bring it to you.

One of the three times I was there (yesterday) was a Vegetarian Monday, as the other reviewer mentioned.  It was spectacular.  I, too, tried the vegan Caesar, just to give it a shot, and - wow.  I told my husband last night that it could have definitely been the best Caesar salad of my life.  The romaine was crisp and refreshing, and presented still in long stalks instead of already chopped, which I thought was a nice touch.  Also, the roasted tomatoes on the plate (not usually in a Caesar) were out of this world.  And the dressing....I don't know how they did that creamy deliciousness without milk or cheese, but, I gotta hand it to them.  Amazing.  My husband tried the bruschetta on polenta last night and was also wowed.  We've also had the vegetable cannelloni, a regular mixed salad (one recommendation:  order the dressing on the side; it can be a bit overpowering), and some fried mozzarella appetizer.

I have NEVER been disappointed in an entree from Lago; in fact, I always have quite the opposite reaction.  I have had the airline chicken--succulent! atop vegetable lasagna which could have been its own dish (in other, more ""chic"" cities, they would never consider pairing these, mostly because it's like you're getting two meals for the price of ONE!), the lobster gnocchi, the ravioli, the sundried tomato gnocchi with garlic cream sauce...all great.  Last night, though, was by far the best.  I got the pasta special--veal tortelloni with pancetta and peas in cream sauce--that had me almost licking the plate.  Apparently, this is a dish that constantly goes on and off the menu and came highly recommended.  I asked the waitress, ""Why do you ever take this OFF the menu?""  She replied, ""We gotta keep you guys wanting it.""  I guess that might be part of the appeal...but I haven't had an Italian dish that well done since I used to frequent Little Italy in NY.  I only wonder why Lago doesn't seem to get as much business as it deserves."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I think I might be the luckiest unlucky person ever.

My husband and I went to North Olmstead to the La-Z-Boy to pick up a chair we ordered last weekend, hoping to eat somewhere along the way.  I was craving barbecue like nobody's business, but my husband said there's no way he'd go to Famous Dave's nearby. Okay, whatever.

Our chair wasn't there.  They were about to put the wrong one into our car!  Arg. (Review of La-Z-Boy pending.)  They told us we could go to the Middleburg Heights location.  I wanted to bust a cap in someone's ass, I was so hungry.  But to Middleburg we went and got our damn chair.

Then I used my phone to Yelp for any restaurant in the area.  I wasn't even looking specifically for bbq, but the first item on the list was the Brew Kettle in Strongsville.  It was less than a mile from the La-Z-Boy store in Middleburg Heights.  A brewpub?  Hells yeah!  Then I saw what some yelpers said.  It features barbecue?!?!  WHAT WHAT!!  Like Miley Cyrus says, ""You've got the best of both worlds.""

I sampled five beers and so did my husband.  They let you circle the numbers on a paper menu and then they place them in front of you in numerical order so you know what you're drinking.  The beer menu was also cool because they lay out not only the alcohol content but also the ""bitterness factor"" (I forget the code they use for this).  High points of my sampler included a Dunkelweizen; the TBK (their own brewery) Winter Warmer - a great seasonal beer; and the Wyders Pear Cider.

Now onto the food.  My husband and I ordered a couple of appetizers, which included a buffalo ""dip"" which was totally gross in a good way (it was like a blended-up version of buffalo wings and cheese - and no bones, says the menu-gee thanks) served with tortilla chips.  We also had nachos, although we had no business eating more tortilla chips - with a MOUNTAIN of pulled pork on top.  It was so great because it was perfectly smoked without being overseasoned, greasy, or salty.  

The only bad thing is that I haven't eaten this terribly since I used to frequent TGI Friday's in high school.  We had to order some sides of broccoli just to feel better about ourselves.  It was, surprisingly, cooked perfectly despite the fact that it was drenched in butter sauce.  Oh well, when in Rome.

We didn't even have any room for a main course.  It's too bad.  I would love to come back to try the mac 'n' cheese with andouille or the barbecue spaghetti.

The staff wasn't what I would call friendly, but they were competent enough that it didn't matter.  It was hella crowded by the time we left -- therefore,taking advantage of the minimal crowds during early bird time (dinner at 4:30 bitches!) paid off yet again."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I've found the best pizza in Cleveland right here!!!

Combining the Neapolitan style of Crostada's with the helpful and passionate staff of Sweet Basil, Biga excels in all areas. Most impressive of all being the pizza.

There are so many things right with this place. The fact that it is about a 40-minute drive east didn't deter these West Siders from getting there within minutes of opening (5pm) yesterday. We'd called ahead (they take phone reservations via voicemail and will call back to confirm -- highly recommend you do this), and they had our cute table of four waiting for us, complete with high chair and two Etch-a-Sketches for the kids to play with.

Having read the reviews, we started off with the bread sticks. I could have made a meal of these alone. The bread was wonderful -- like an Italian version of Naan, but even better -- and the parmesan cheese and bright, flavorful tomato sauce made it sing. We also shared a salad of local greens (I think that was actually the name of the salad too). Very good, with fresh lettuce right from their own garden. (On the menu, by the way, an asterisk indicates which ingredients are grown right there in Biga's backyard.)

For the pizza, we tried three: the Margherita (because it's my favorite), the Spicy Pepperoni, and a seasonal white pie with bacon and asparagus. Holy hell...this was possibly one of the best selections of pizza I've ever eaten. The crust was from another planet. Unlike Crostata's, which falls a little limp and thin in the middle of the pie, Biga's was sturdy, yet chewy, throughout.  It passed the ""fold test"" yet you didn't really want to fold it because the aromatic flavors and textures more easily wafted to your nose if you left it open.

For dessert (how could we not?), we opted for the ""donuts"" (which were reminiscent of zeppoles from Italian street fairs, yet cut into thick strips), served with warm Nutella for dipping. Needless to say, we didn't leave any of those over (although we definitely could have -- there were enough donuts on that plate to feed the entire restaurant). The funny thing is that, even after feasting for an hour on all this delicious food, we didn't feel sick or stuffed on our way out. Perhaps it was because we boxed a good amount of pizza to go, but I can't help but think it's also due to the light, fresh ingredients that don't have added grease or sugar.

Knowing it was BYOB, we saved a bundle on not buying drinks and instead enjoyed our own beer in the chilled glasses they provided. And the bill came to just under $100 including a generous tip -- not bad for a family of four (yes, even the baby ate pizza and breadsticks!).

If you're in the Kirtland area -- or even if you're not -- pay a visit to Biga. You will not be sorry!!!"
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"Yeah, so far Las Vegas has a great track record with me! Giving out five-star reviews left and right. Well, I don't mean to sound like the girl who yelped wolf, but Rosemary's definitely, DEFINITELY deserves five stars.

It's in a strip mall about 15 minutes away from the strip (first plus). The windows are tinted, almost black even, and you can't see inside from the outside. You walk in and it's this amazingly cozy, warm atmosphere, with servers dancing (not literally) around tables making everyone's evening as pleasant as possible.

I came here with my husband, daughter, husband's boss and boss' family (wife and two kids, 17 and 7). While Rosemary's is by no means a ""family"" restaurant, they were extremely accommodating of our party. I've come to learn just how annoying it is to have babies in restaurants sometimes. Not like I didn't already know this...but I'm always more self-conscious of it now. The staff at Rosemary's acted like the kids were the guests of honor, which was so sweet. They even brought a silver cover for my meal so it wouldn't get cold when I had to tend to the little one away from the table. Very classy all around.

I should mention that the restaurant offers two different prix-fixe options nightly (app/app/entree or app/entree/dessert) in lieu of paying per item. There was also an amuse bouche, which, as I think back to all my dining experiences, I've only had a handful of times, and signals to me a special restaurant that's really got its shit together.

To start, I had the cauliflower soup. I know what you're thinking: what's the big deal? It was A BIG DEAL. Delicious, rich, like nobody ever thought cauliflower could be. Creamy, with a sprinkling of parmesan and a swirl of olive oil. Decadent, really!

Then I had the salmon on a bed of lentils. It was cooked PERFECTLY medium-rare (and the server mentioned this is how it is normally done and asked if that was ok). It had a flavorful, crunchy crust that was not overwhelming and didn't detract from the joy of the fish itself. The lentils were dressed lightly in some kind of lemony deliciousness. Yep, a real culinary vocabulary I've got. Anyway, they were great. I also got a really great white wine that the waiter suggested I pair with these dishes. (Pairing recommendations are offered on the menu for each dish.) 

For dessert, I decided not to order something else to eat, but rather, a ""fifth avenue"" dessert cocktail, consisting of cream, apricot brandy, and creme de cacao. Wowza! That was strong and delicious. There were a bunch of other drink options available, and the desserts looked wonderful too.

Overall, Rosemary's seems like a very well-kept secret, except that the word has apparently gotten out. Go for a special evening, go for a relaxed drink at the bar ... just go!"
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I've been really excited to try Istanbul Grill since its opening in July. It is located near the corner of Professor and Starkweather (near Lilly and Lucky's). 

We called ahead to make a reservation, which they said was unnecessary.  It was - we were seated right away (good to know for a Friday night at around 7).  

There are two main sections to the restaurant -  downstairs by the bar, with high-tops as well as low-tops, and another busier area up near the kitchen.  Unlike what I usually expect from areas near a bar, this one was very quiet, while the upstairs section (where we were seated) was stuffed with families with kids, couples, and friend-dates. It was animated up there, but not so loud that you couldn't hear your dining companions.

We were brought menus and drinks right away, but I can't say the same for some other groups, who kept giving each other ""that look"" as the only two waitresses for the whole restaurant kept passing them by without pouring them water or taking their orders. It wasn't a large place, but it's not like a one-room establishment either. The waitresses, while polite, seemed frantic. It didn't help that there were several large parties there demanding attention. 

We ordered the cacik (yogurt with cucumber, mint, dill, and spices) which was delicious. The bread it came with was heavenly and very warm. We were even given a free refill of the bread, which is great because you always seem to get more dip than bread but usually have to pay extra to get enough bread to actually finish your dip. You know what I mean.

Now here's where the service got quite slow. We waited about 45 minutes for our entrees. We did get a couple of check-ins by the waitress, as well as a couple of apologies, which was nice. It seems like everyone on the top floor got served at the exact same time, which is nice for all the other tables who hadn't been there for half the time we were, but annoying for us because we should have gotten our food sooner.

But everything tasted great. I got falafel on a Mediterranean salad. The falafels were big and rather soft on the inside, although nicely battered and fried on the outside. Also, they weren't too spicy.  My husband thinks that what he was brought wasn't actually what he ordered, because it didn't match the description at all.  But he didn't say anything and ate it anyway and said it was great, and full of flavor.

The host who seated us (and who might be the owner too, but I'm not sure) was very friendly and walked around to the tables chatting with guests. 

I liked this restaurant's food very much. I think that a lot of kinks have to be ironed out with regard to the service and am willing to wait a couple of months before trying it again to see if that element has improved. By then, it may have blown up, so I hope we can still get a table!"
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"Excellent!

Derek and I went here last Sunday night for our anniversary dinner. I would have to agree that the steak, atmosphere, and service were top-notch. The side dishes were okay. But then again, maybe my definition of ""okay"" is someone else's ""amazing.""

First, the space. It was old-fashioned and modern simultaneously. Very unique. I loved the little area it was tucked away in ... felt like a small town despite being off of Detroit Road in Suburbia, USA.

Our server was knowledgeable and thorough. A tad snarky, though: she called my husband out for ""not listening"" while she was announcing the specials. (To be fair, he WAS being a bit rude by checking the Tigers/Yankees score on his phone, but I'd like to think that I'm the only one irritated by this.)

I ordered a drink that was highly unnecessary, because it didn't really get me buzzed, but just kinda gave me a sugar rush. I forgot the name of it, but it had ginger liqueur, cranberry juice, and lime. Picture a Cosmo with no hard liquor and an undercurrent of ginger. They were out of the 90-minute IPA on draft, so my husband just ordered something out of the bottle.

We decided to get the dinner for two, which consists of 2 six-ounce filets, 2 sides, a soup or salad apiece, and a dessert to share. We ordered the Harvest salads and were very happy with them. The dressing is a little sweet, so be aware -- there's a lot of honey in it. Also, the nut clusters (almonds I think?) seemed to be roasted and coated in a cinnamon-sugar mixture.

The steaks were out of this world. Best I have ever had!

The sides. Okay. We decided to order one ""healthy"" side and one unhealthy side. We got the sauteed spinach, which came with (gag) whole mushrooms). Not my fave. The mac and cheese was the other one. I had such high hopes for it ... but I was not too impressed! First of all, there were way too many breadcrumbs on top. (Or was it parmesan cheese? Either way, too crumby and they weren't baked in enough.) Secondly, the concoction itself was odd. The sauce was waaaay too creamy/cheesy for the size of the pasta, which were basically mini-shells. If that same sauce had been on penne, or bigger shells, or rotini, or something, it would have been much better.

Also, the size of the sides was just obscene. We didn't make a dent in either of them. It was just a waste of food. (We did take some home, but reheated is not the same with spinach or even mac and cheese.)

The dessert (Twizzted) was phenomenal. So odd, but delicious. Cherry twizzler gelato with a hard chocolate shell atop a little chocolate cake with pop rocks around it. Need I say more?

Anyway, I would definitely recommend this place. It is the first steakhouse I've ever been to that has been innovative and modern while simultaneously maintaining traditional aspects of the dining experience. Great for out-of-towners, in-laws, and anyone wanting a great steak in a cool atmosphere."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I can understand how the cozy and intimate space has been, and will be, missed. But in my eyes, the new location is modern, innovative, and just beautiful. And, most importantly, the quality of most of the dishes has not skipped a beat.

Derek and I returned to Crop recently to partake of a Sunday supper. We did NOT have the kids! YAAAAAAY (um, can you tell I've been cooped up in the house too long with a newborn?). While I kinda wished I'd had the opportunity to linger over the regular menu and take forever to make my decision, it was fine to have just the options of the dishes they were serving that night for $30/person.

For a cocktail, I had the porch swing. Weeeeee! Drunk after 2 sips. We had the truffle popcorn which was a little weird in my opinion. The popcorn wasn't crunchy, just kind of chewy. Normal? I don't know; I'd never tried their balsamic popcorn either. 

We had a huge, colorful, tasty salad (they called it their ""Late Summer Salad""). It had golden and red beets, grapes, melon, arugula, and more. It was delicious and plentiful! My only criticism would be that it was a little overdressed with what the server referred to as ""Balsamic Vin"" -- LOL.

For our entrees, Derek had the cherry-braised short ribs served with cornbread and I had the pappardelle with a mushroom sauce.  Derek said that his was a bit vinegary, but overall he liked it a lot. I was in love with the pasta and the sauce's flavor, but the mushrooms in the dish were HUGE and I am not too down with that. I prefer my mushrooms chopped up a little more -- that is probably declasse. Whatever!

The sides were smashed potatoes and ratatouille. Both were fine. Nothing to write home about, and actually the potatoes needed a little seasoning.

Dessert was a pumpkin pie-type-thing, which was AWESOME and served with dried cranberries and some kind of sugared pecans or something of that nature. Mmm. The reason I enjoy this meal in general is that it allows you to try things you ordinarily wouldn't. I was so glad to be ""forced"" to eat this pumpkin dessert, because when given the chance I'd have probably gone with something chocolate in nature.

The only complaint I had about this was that we were never offered coffee with our dessert, and then the bill was just placed on the table before we could ask. Do they not serve coffee for Sunday Supper -- anybody know?

Service was great, as usual. The four star rating is just because we didn't ABSOLUTELY LOVE our meals this time like the other times. 

I don't really think that the space is too big. It's just that the sound isn't absorbed by the velvet couches, etc. anymore that makes it seem so vast in there. That, and the ridiculously tall ceiling, which is actually a great feature because of the artistic design of the ceiling. The space really is a work of art, as is the food. Instead of thinking of what has been, consider Crop Bistro to be a really great place right NOW. And it will probably only get better."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I am puzzled and intrigued by this Mexican restaurant. The kitchen area takes up at least half of the space, which is cool but also strange. You order at the counter, then find a seat among mismatched furniture and Latin-American knick-knacks, fake flowers, and fountains. You wait ... and wait ... and wait. And then you're brought your food, and it is good. REALLY good.

Quite a few negatives with this place. I'll get those out of the way first.

1. The aforementioned long wait, for .. what? A burrito. Well, two burritos. The guy with the cowboy hat apologized and said that they'd run out of rice. Huh? At a restaurant where rice is pretty much the common factor among all dishes? And at 6 pm on a Saturday, when you know you're going to have a high volume of customers? (Yet, another reason the wait threw us for such a loop was because we were one of only three parties in there, and one had already gotten their food by the time we'd ordered.)

2. The flies. Ugh. I hate bugs in general, and am actually afraid of them. I won't eat anything a fly has already landed on. So there were times that I was actually darting flies at the table and moving my plate around so that they wouldn't decide to pop a squat on my burrito.

3. Although the listing claims the restaurant is good for kids (and it very well may be, for older kids) there are no high chairs. So we had to hold a squirmy baby and attempt to feed her from that position. Kind of annoying and probably the major reason we won't be returning.

4. Bottled water only (not free). But actually, thinking of the overall skeeviness factor of the place, I'd probably better count that as a positive because I'm not sure I'd want to drink their tap water.

Now, onto the positives:

1. VERY GOOD FOOD! The burrito was ginormous and oh so tasty. I got the avocado-lime burrito with chicken. Everything tasted amazing. My only qualm? It was very, very wet. It came in just a tin foil wrapper plopped on a plate -- which is fine -- but we weren't given silverware and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to pick this monster up and put it into my mouth. Not to mention that it had something on the outside -- it almost seemed like some kind of liquid and then sprinkled with sugar, oddly enough -- so that it was completely impractical to try to use my hands for this. But it tasted great.

2. There were two young women who helped us -- one taking the order and another who stepped in after we'd been there for a bit who got us silverware and wrapped our leftovers. They were very kind and seemed like fun people. 

So, will I try El Tango again? Not to dine in again, probably ever. It just wasn't really worth it, in my opinion, because it wasn't an enjoyable atmosphere and wasn't appropriate for the baby. And it's not the type of place I'd want to waste on a date night, because it's not special enough. But the food was great, so I will definitely consider takeout in the future.

Although I really have to stop thinking about those flies."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"You know it's a good sign when you can hardly walk home after eating so much.

My husband and I tried the new(ish) Dante for his 30th birthday recently after hearing good things from a friend. It did not disappoint!

The menu is kind of unique (well, I know many restaurants do the ""small plate"" thing, but the layout seemed original). There were three rows, each sub-divided into smaller columns to differentiate themselves. I guess the top row was first courses, second courses below that, and third courses at the bottom. Throughout the menu the options ranged from salads, soups, shellfish, some raw dishes, specialty meats, a variety of pastas, risottos, and polenta; and the beef/fish/poultry section at the bottom. Each of these dishes (with the exception of the polenta) has the option of being served as a ""tasting,"" an ""appetizer,"" or as a ""main course"" size, so there's a lot of flexibility.  They also offered a chef's tasting menu of five courses, with an optional wine pairing.

The waiter made some suggestions to us about mixing and matching, or even sharing a main course which he said was not out of the ordinary. (By the way, our waiter was great and very attentive. PLUS I got the door to the ladies' room held open for me by one of the servers. Totally unnecessary, but a nice touch.)

My husband, wanting a special treat on his birthday, opted for the tasting menu. He was brought the meat plate, the tuna tartar, a pasta of his choice (he chose the papardelle bolognese), and the lamb chop. The fifth course, dessert, I'll discuss in a few.

 I decided to do my own variety: the pea soup, the spaghetti pesto, the three-cheese polenta, and the brown arborio risotto (all tasting sizes at about $4 each). I asked the waiter, ""Is this too much food?"" He said, ""No, it's perfect.""

It was too much food.

HOWEVER: it was some of the best-tasting food ever! Even though I was seriously on carb overload, and even though I had to box up half of each of the last two dishes, I was still glad I got to try everything. 

My favorite dish of the night was DEFINITELY the three-cheese polenta. The soup was good, but not exceptional and I definitely wouldn't have ordered it had I known what else I would be getting placed in front of me later. The pesto was soo rich and decadent. And the risotto had pretty good flavors, but was waaay too salty and the texture wasn't quite right - I think risotto is generally softer, creamier, and more ""silky"" if it's done right. But maybe the brown arborio changed things in this dish.

My husband loved each and every bite of his.

And for dessert - which automatically came with his tasting menu - he ordered the chocolate peanut parfait with toffee ice cream and caramel. HELLO! It was so gigantic and filling that we could barely finish it. They also apparently had some good drinks (my husband had a couple green apple mojitos, not to be confused with the ""pucker"" sour apple crap, but with actual fresh-cut apples in the drink.) We seriously stumbled out of there clutching our stomachs. It was great."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"If we had been greeted with a smile, served quickly (like you should be served in a diner), and been provided with a clean environment, The Coffee Pot would have gotten a full 5 stars.

But instead, we walk in and get stared at. Every table is full -- understandable, but no ""Can I help you?"" Instead, blank stares from everyone seated as well as the woman behind the counter. She says it'll be 15 minutes, so we said we'd wait right outside.

Well, it was only 5 minutes until the table right by the window clears out. Great! We go in and expect the usual: water, utensils/napkins, etc. Nope. After the table gets wiped off and we settle in, nobody comes to us for at least 10 minutes.

Finally, we get a drink order in. About five minutes later we are brought our coffees, but no cream or sugar (she took our orders and said she was going to bring it afterwards). But she doesn't, and we think they have forgotten about it. It's so sad to see a cup of STEAMING hot coffee go to waste because you can't put your stuff in it and drink it (and no, drinking it black was not an option). So I take matters into my own hands, grab sugar from an empty table and cream from the counter. But there are still no spoons to stir it with, so I kinda jiggle it back and forth.

And that's where we sit and wait ... and wait for over 30 minutes.

Mind you, it HAD been full when we walked in. But tables are leaving and no more people are coming in. So what gives?

It's while I'm sitting and waiting that we start to notice gross -- unacceptably gross -- things about this place. It is filthy. There is dirt and dust on every surface that is not a table. I don't think the underside of the tables, the chairs, and the floor have been given a good cleaning in ages. I see a wasp lazily crawling on the window ledge next to our table, and because it looks pretty drunk, I'm not too scared that it's going to fly over and sting me. But it is still a disgusting environment to be eating in.

So then what? The food comes. And boy, is it GOOD. So fucking delicious! I am having a total mindfuck. Was I just hungry before and pissed off that our daughter cannot sit in her high chair (which was, also, filthy and had cream of wheat on it from the last baby who sat in it) unless she is occupied? With food, I mean. We had Elmo, books, and her juice, but she had no interest in sitting down in this seat until her pancake was in front of her.  Again, there weren't that many people in the place at this point -- only 3 tables -- so I don't know what takes so long for a couple of scrambled eggs and hash out of can.

HOWEVER: Again. The food tasted like crack, it was so good. And there was a lot of it. And then the women started acting all nice to us.  So was my pre-food attitude just an overly sensitive one? I usually give places the benefit of the doubt, especially greasy spoons/locally owned holes-in-the-wall. But this was less of a greasy spoon and more of a dirty spoon.

So anyway. I don't think I will ever ever go here again because of the cleanliness factor and the fact that we spent an hour and a half in a fucking DINER. That should be against the law because the point of going to a diner is to get good coffee, good hot food served quickly .... and then to get the fuck out of there."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I think I'm entering Cleveland's desperation-proximity-value continuum.

At first, I thought that staying local was the way to go while getting to know what's around, even if it paid a little more.  Especially with something like car maintenance, where you're sort of eager to have it done right away no matter the cost.  I've reviewed Fairfield Gas & Auto three times now, and that's because each time I've gone there, I've walked out just a tad more skeptical if the work done was worth it, or even necessary.  Being an optimist in theory, I'd like to think the owner wasn't trying to take advantage of my knowing next to nothing about cars.  But as experience would show, people always have to take advantage of an opportunity to make more money.

In the past, I had this thought: I know it's pricey, but it's right down the street and I can walk home while I wait for it.  Now that I know some surrounding areas (as well as all of YOU NICE YELP PEOPLE who will give/have given me suggestions), I think I'm going to avoid this place.  I always leave having more done than I want, and paying MUCH more than you want.  Not just because you get ""talked into"" getting more, but because they throw it on you and say it's absolutely necessary or you could be asking for more trouble.  It's our only car, and I don't want it to break down.  

And while I used to think this cigarette-filled, teensy-weensy waiting area with one foldout chair was sort of charismatic and authentic, now I am just annoyed by the seeming lack of cleanliness in the place (and the fact that my car smells like smoke every time they work on it).

On Friday I went in for an oil change.  I also inquired about new windshield wipers.  I was told that I definitely needed new ones (big surprise there).  When I asked about price, of course they gave me that iffy ""anywhere from $13.99 to $39.99 each wiper depending on size"" stuff.  Okay, okay.

While I was waiting, the owner's wife (I think) was there make a loud ruckus (""Can you describe the ruckus, sir?"").  Let's just say she was teasing her kid by trying to steal his toy truck, while simultaneously ignoring calls on her cell phone and saying ""Fuck OFF!""  That, and she kept trying to include me in on her little conversations with herself.  It was super pleasant.

When the other mechanic was ""done,"" he brought the car around but when the owner asked him if he had put new washer fluid in, he said, ""Aw shit, no."" And then I had to wait another ten minutes.  And then of course they forgot about the windshield wipers.  And then there were none left, so they had to go to the back and get a new box....all in all, I could have just gone home and not dealt with this but since he told me it was only gonna be ten minutes, I waited.  I should have known that ""ten minutes"" means at least half an hour in auto-mechanic land.

This is the best part.  He said to me, ""usually an oil change is $29.99.  But you need V5 oil in your car, so it's ten dollars more.""  AFTER he already did it!  I didn't even have the energy to tell him that I have a receipt from him for a month earlier with the $29.99 charge.  I don't know if he thinks I'm dumb, but I guess I am for not fighting that.  Truth is, he seemed pretty out of sorts in general, and not very professional.  In any case, I am DEFINITELY going somewhere else next time.  Suggestions?"
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I was really excited to visit Cleveland's new aquarium. I took my mom and 1-year old there this afternoon, and honestly, it wasn't worth the money, hassle, or crowds.

As far as location, it's fine and not hard to get to. It was pretty exciting to drive over there and see how this new attraction might revitalize the Flats. But my excitement quickly soured when we waited in a line of cars in order to pay $5 for parking. Why? There was plenty of it, and no real reason to charge for it other than the fact that they could.

We knew in advance, from asking a friend who had gone the weekend prior, that the aquarium was entirely indoors and that no strollers were allowed inside (the latter of which made sense only after seeing the cramped, disorganized space). So we left our jackets in the car and brought a carrier for the baby so I could ""wear"" her through the exhibits. But I could see that people who had not been informed of this no-stroller rule were pretty annoyed that they had to lug their kids around. Not like it's really conducive to having kids roam around anyway, which was another problem. It was so crowded inside that any parent would be terrified to let their kid just run off in this environment. (Plus: for any short kid, there was hardly anything to see without being picked up, as the tanks were all about four feet off the ground.)

We opted to skip the fifty-person line and, instead, went through the ""express"" check-in, which consisted of us putting all of our personal information (including credit card #, address, phone - they wouldn't accept without the last two) on a piece of paper. We breezed through admission this way, where we handed our slip to a woman who we thought was going to enter the numbers into a computer and then destroy the slip. Instead, she blithely tossed the paper to the ground on top of a pile of others -- what's to stop someone from just slipping behind her and picking them up?

The exhibits themselves could hardly be counted as such. Instead, it was just like an endless, hot, claustrophobic tunnel of water tubes with boring fish. There were hokey ""characters"" throughout (some of whom sort of seemed fitting, such as a pirate, but others who just seemed odd, such as a man in a beret playing the accordion next to the Florida Keys exhibit). It seemed as though they thought these ""extra"" things were supposed to make it interesting or worth the 22 bucks. When I pay that much money for a museum or attraction, I'm expecting any of the following: a short movie/screening of some sort; a demonstration; interactive exhibits where kids can actually touch stuff or go on computers; and even the option of food. I know if there had been food, it would have been ridiculously overpriced, so that's probably a good thing that it wasn't offered. But there were hardly even places to sit down, and every chair there was was taken by hordes of families. My daughter had fun playing with some aquatic-themed toys in a common play area for children, and that was honestly probably the highlight of the visit.

We got out of there as soon as we could. When we got back to the car we realized we had spent less than an hour inside. Even the parking lot was a disaster; the aisles were way too narrow and I practically had to make a 5-point turn to get out without hitting a kid or the car behind me.

I don't consider myself a snob by any means, but this was so not worth my time."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"AAAUGUGAAAHHH! (That's code for ""I hate going out on New Year's Eve!"")

My husband and I decided to do the NYE meal at Fahrenheit.  This included 5 courses, and a glass of champagne, for $60/person.  I don't know if this was the perfect choice, but it was very good.  We love this restaurant.  The food is great.  It's walking distance from our apartment.  But maybe we should have just made dinner at home because we are both easily annoyed at crowds and the general hoopla that is New Year's Eve.  If I could, I would give this night 3.5 stars.

We chose the 6 pm seating because we're old and lame.  We were seated right away...in the worst possible table in the restaurant.  I know this can't be helped, but it was one of those tall tables scrunched up thisclose to another one.  The party in the adjacent table was already seated and I had about an inch of room to squeeze in without disturbing her.  Plus, we were right up against a (deep maroon colored) wall. Talk about claustrophobia.  I don't know about you, but I like to be comfortable when I eat.  It's just part of the experience.  Adding to the madness was a group seated nearby whose group had ALL ""loud talkers.""  You know how every restaurant has this ONE loud talker?  And sometimes each group has one?  Well this group had all the loud talkers in the restaurant put together.  Not the restaurant's fault, certainly!  But you can see how the cacophony detracted a bit from the experience tonight.

The waiter was good, and did everything quickly, but the service was kind of cold in general.  We tried the tuna tartar (my first time with this dish and I was VERY pleased) and the kobe beef short ribs.  Yum.  The second course (salad for me and lobster bisque for him) came out before we were through with the first course.  I majorly hate that.  I also majorly hated my salad, which had fried goat cheese (a high point) and sour cherry tapenade (making my mouth pucker unpleasantly when I think about it).  The greens were not dressed in the least, and the tapenade did not serve well as a dressing.  Failure.  The bisque was delicious, but my husband was full by the time he was done with that.

The third course brought me back up the roller coaster.  I had the lobster mac & cheese.  Ridiculously awesome.  My heart was beating extremely fast when I finished.   So rich.  And yes, I ate it all. 

We were almost going to tell our waiter to save himself the trouble of bringing the last two courses out (dessert and cheese), but that was too embarrassing.  So we ate what we could.  It was like Man vs. Food in there.  Even I couldn't finish anything else.  Our waiter offered us a box for the cheese plate (which, in addition to 5 different cheeses & crackers, featured berries, almonds, and some other jam-looking concoction).

As usual, the drinks were stupidly extravagant, but majorly alcoholic and good.  My husband had the Merry Mojito and the Light & Stormy (some light rum, ginger beer, and lime).  I had my usual standby, the InZinerator Zinfandel.

We rolled out of there stuffed to the brim.  Looking at our watches, we realized we had spent over 2 hours there, but it still seemed a bit rushed to me for 5 courses.  I don't know.  They had to get ready for another seating at 9:30, which I get.  I just think it might have worked a little bit in their favor if there was more time in between courses so we could digest a little bit...maybe drink a little more...etc.

I won't hold it against them too much, because this was the only time I have been less than satisfied with Fahrenheit.  I think it was just the nature of the holiday that had things a little outta sorts."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"This is now my new favorite Cleveland restaurant!

Went here last night after hearing so many good things about it (mostly from fellow Yelpers like yourselves).  The fact that pizza was featured was a plus, because I can't not eat pizza if given the option.  I also knew about the great wine selection here.  What I hadn't realized prior (but should have; I've passed by enough times) is that McNulty's Bier Markt (a Belgian beer bar) is the other half of this place, and that they feature their entire beer menu as well.  HELLO!  Wonderful.

I know absolutely nothing about architecture or design, so I will refrain from making any technical comments about the decor, but I LOVED it.  I really liked that there were a ton of different rooms, each with a different feel.  It seemed more open and airy in the front, and more warm and cozy toward the back.  We sat right across from the kitchen which we always think is fun because then we can see all the food coming out.  I also loved how the tables were set up in a low-key, but thoughtful way: a wine glass filled with extra water; a baby carafe of olive oil; little tin buckets holding paper towel napkins and silverware, and a brown-paper sack of rolls.  So cool.  We almost missed the rolls and weren't sure if the water was actually more olive oil because it was in a dark green bottle, but we liked how we had to sort of investigate more closely to find out.  (Good thing we didn't pour water all over our bread.)

I was in a beer mood, and went for the Avery White Rascal (it's sort of a blessing in disguise that the Blue Moon was kicked, because it gave me a chance to try a new beer).  My husband, over the course of our meal, tried three different beers, all of which came in delightfully awesome glasses of various heights and shapes.  Like they should. I love that!  He got an Oktoberfest, a beer that tasted like cherries, and the last one whose name I actually remember because it was so weird: Gulden Draak (10.5% alchohol!). 

But wait, the food!  I can't even explain to you the happiness I felt from start to finish.  Let me try.

-Meat Plate (Small): My husband had this, and it looked great, but I am not a meat plate type of gal.
-House Salad: Looked appetizing, tasted very good, although would have preferred a little more variety in the greens.  Nicely dressed, very light, with parmesan on top.
-STEAK FRIES.  Are you KIDDING ME?!??!?  I haven't had fries this good since....since.........get the point?  Thick sprigs of rosemary and whole crushed cloves of garlic tossed in.  The fries are served with a traditional paper cone on the plate (made from a menu) with ketchup and three different mayos: garlic aioli, curry, and chili.  The rosemary was intoxicating.  I have never had better fries.  Seriously!  They have single portions, but when you get them for the table, they call them ""Super Frites,"" which conjured up Rick James and therefore made me laugh.

-Pizza: We ordered only one, thank god, because after those fries (which were a meal in and of themselves) I couldn't eat much more.  We got the wild mushroom, which came with pancetta and thyme.  So crisp, just the right amount of cheese and oil....so good!

For dessert we got the ice cream sampler (very steep at $9; we didn't expect to only get 4 teeeny-weensy scoops).  I'd avoid this when the rest of the desserts were only $5.  Still, the ice cream flavors (root beer, salted caramel, smoked chocolate w/marshmallows, and goat cheese w/cherries) were innovative and delicious.

The fact that we ate like pigs, got 5 drinks between the two of us, AND had dessert was sooo worth the price tag of $72.  At any ""fancy"" place, we would have definitely been paying well over a hundred bucks.

We plan to take our families here when they visit!"
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"I'm not exactly sure what to say.

We needed a chair so that we wouldn't have to keep using patio furniture in our living room when people came over.  My in-laws very nicely offered to buy us a recliner for a Christmas present, and they highly recommended La-Z-Boy as a durable, comfortable brand that would last a long time.

We scouted a store out and found one in North Olmstead.  Now I should say that in any place like this you will get bombarded by salespeople as soon as you walk through the door. I hate that, but I understand.  It's just that I don't feel like having someone watch me sit on 15 different chairs.  It's uncomfortable.

Needless to say, that happened, and the woman who assigned herself to us was a quirky, friendly, helpful salesperson.  She did kind of go overboard in asking us some personal questions, but she wanted us to be prepared ""should we ever expand our family"" or ""should our animal ever emit bodily fluids on the material.""  Apparently, any bodily fluids, rips, tears, or stains are covered by warranty so long as you call within 2 days and you actually know what the stain is (if you don't, they won't cover it).  OK!  Maybe we'll just throw some plastic over the thing whenever we go near it.

She convinced us to buy a chair, but did NOT succeed in having us spend an additional $400 on a chair-side table (I'll take my $19 table from Target, thank you very much).  She was so hyped up by the end because she was trying to tell us when the chair would be in (it was out of stock and they had to order the specific design we wanted).  We told her there was no rush, especially because it is technically a Christmas present which is a while away.  No no no, she needed it there fast.  ""Hey! It can be there probably Thursday! And you don't need HIM (pointing to my husband) to come with ya.  You can just bring a friend.  It's not heavy.  Or the guys can put it in the car for ya.""  Etc. etc.  I was sooo on salesperson overload at this point that I kept eating jolly ranchers from the bowl on her counter and zoning out.

We got a call that it was in and we asked if we could pick up on Saturday.  Great!  But when we got there....nope, not our chair.  It was the same ""make"" but not the same design.  After explaining this to two different people in the garage who seemed clueless, we had the manager come out and talk to us, and then I had to walk through the back garage (holding the hatchback thingie of my car) and actually point to the chair in the store as well as the fabric itself that I had spent an hour doing the previous week.  And he still didn't seem to get it.

Then our saleswoman appeared.  She kept apologizing, which I guess was sincere, and she said ""My last day is Friday, and I think in the 2 years I've been working here this has only happened ONE OTHER TIME!""  I don't care!

She said there were two options that she saw.  One: we go pick up the chair from Middleburg Heights right then.  Or two: she goes ""on my time -- and I totally don't mind doing this"" to get it and bring it back to the North Olmstead store on Monday and we can pick it up there.

Now up until this point I was slightly amused and a bit aggravated, but now I was getting pissed.  Neither of those options really make things easier for us.  Either we'd have to drive out to Middleburg OR we'd have to drive BACK here next week.  Plus, what kind of a person would I be if I had actually said that I think she should go and get it when she's not working?  It would have made me the bad guy.  I should have just said, ""Or how about option three: you have it shipped to our apartment free of charge?""  It's times like this that I just wish I had a pair of cojones.

We decided to just get it ourselves.  We went to the other place and were out of there within 5 minutes.  I think I might just give the other place 5 stars that very reason.

By the way, the chair rocks.  Both literally and figuratively!"
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"It always takes me a couple of weeks to process a hotel stay. Here I go:

The Wynn hotel is way too nice of a hotel for me and my family. However, we lucked out because my husband was on a business trip for the ConExpo and his boss booked the rooms. Thank god we got reimbursed. 

However, even if we could afford to stay here normally, I'm not sure this is the place I'd choose. It was perfectly luxurious in every way, from the rooms to the lobby to the huge waterfall outside. But it was just sort of unnecessary. Not that I really wanted to stay at Circus Circus or anything. But there are nice hotels I've stayed in (the Mirage being one, or MGM) where it's nice without being overstated or gaudy. 

I realize Vegas is, by definition, over-the-top, but it wasn't needed here. We have a very young daughter and I probably would have been more comfortable at a place without an excess of nightclubs, lounges, and people giving me ""that look"" every time we walked around the casino to get outside. Not to mention the secondhand smoke. Someone else had mentioned they couldn't even tell, but I could, and it was really bad.

Now that I've got my pettiness out of the way, let me discuss the pros:

-FOOD. Amazing. There's a pizza place that tries to replicate NY pizza (and partially succeeds, in my opinion), a deli that wowed me, and a great little cafe to get snacks, breakfast, coffee, and so on. We didn't eat at any of the nicer places here, but I would have liked to had we not had a little one in tow.

-BUFFET: Didn't try it. For $35 per person, I'd rather get pizza and beer.

-SHOPPING. Not only are there designer shops in the lobby's esplanade, but there's also a huge mall right across the street with just about anything you could want. We spent three days just walking around and I only bought one thing (with the exception of food). But there's just so much to see that it's great to window shop, especially when you don't just want to walk up and down the strip and you don't have a car.

-ROOMS: This gets a plus and a minus. The room was ridonkulous. Great view of the strip, great bedding, controls for lights and window shades/sheers from your bedside, a couch, a desk, a table and chairs, a big flat-screen mounted to the wall, THOSE ROBES (you know the ones), and a bathroom superior to all others anywhere I've stayed. Warm lighting, jacuzzi tub, shower with glass doors, a great line of products (body wash, lotion, shampoo, etc.), tv/remote in the bathroom, lighted vanity mirror, and more towels than you could ever know what to do with.

On the bad side? On one night, there was this whirring sound that turned into a full-on shrill whistle that kept waking us up. After searching all over the place we finally concluded that it was coming from the door, which wasn't fully ""sealed"" when shut. If I pressed it closed more, the sound stopped, but when I let go, it would make that shrill noise every five minutes or so. I went in the hallway to see if any other doors were open slightly -- I thought maybe it was creating some sort of ""wind tunnel"" effect. Nope. I called downstairs and the guy's suggestion? ""Put a towel under the door."" Gee, thanks. I mean, it worked, but that's neither good customer service nor is it classy in the least. Nor should I have to do that for the noise to stop! I didn't insist someone come up, because it was late and we were all sleeping. But it was EXTREMELY annoying.

Also, you have to pay for wifi in the rooms. FML. $14 a day PER computer? No way. At least it's free in the cafe and in the pizza place.

-POOLS: there were five of them, all in the same outdoor area. No indoor pool is a minus in my book, because it was only in the 60s. Oh well.

-CASINO: I don't gamble, but it looked ok. Nothing special. On my last night there, I took a dollar from my wallet and gave it a go. I won seven bucks, then lost it all. Big surprise.

-STAFF: Other than the less than helpful guy at the front desk the night I called, the staff were courteous, professional, and helpful.

Would I stay there again? Probably not. Would I recommend it? Probably, depending on your personality and what you desired from your stay. It really is an ""adult"" hotel. But don't let the fancy decor fool you ... there were plenty of people walking around in scrubby clothes here too."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"An early Valentine's dinner brought me and my husband here last night for the first time.  We tried to go on the early side, to avoid a long wait.  Well, we arrived at 5, and the wait was ""30-40 minutes."" So we went to Barnes & Noble next door for 15 minutes, then came back to check on our table, and our name had already been called. I guess I would have found that a relief if I were standing there, but was slightly embarrassed about it being that we had left.

But apparently it had only been called recently, because our table was still open and we got seated immediately.  At the worst seat in the house!

No, seriously, it was a high-top RIGHT by the front door and across from the hostess station, so every two minutes we got blasted by cold air as parties patiently waited with the door half open to come inside (don't they realize what they are doing?). Plus we had our fill of families hogging the space around our table while we sat and ate. (I wouldn't have really guessed this would have been known as a ""family restaurant"" until I saw the overwhelming number of kids roaming around the place like they had no parents worrying about them.  Well, it IS in a mall, I guess!)

I was amused, but a little annoyed, by the snarky list of ""Symon Says"" ettiquette (see Amy L.'s review for more details). They really had to write it on the chalkboard AND have it at every table? They think we're really that obnoxious? (Well, ok, I guess customers are generally known to be guilty of being whiny and impossible to please.) The one that got me more than the others was the whole ""we can omit items, but we can't substitute or add them"" rule.  My husband explained to me that in order to promote efficiency in a place like this, they really need to stick to their menu and then things will happen much more quickly (to our satisfaction). If we start throwing extra things in the mix, it will throw their ""process"" off and cost them time and productivity.  I guess so...but they said something to the effect of ""we have carefully concocted our menu to suit ALL tastes, so you shouldn't have to change anything."" But what if I just wanted a cheeseburger with ONLY mushrooms? Guess I couldn't have it. This is one of the reasons I feel that B spot is a glorified fast-food restaurant with nicer decor.

The second thing that kinda irked me, but which I understood, is that they can't bring out one or two things before the others. ""If your [sic] interested in courses,"" says the diatribe, ""contact your caddie."" Well, fine.  But I kinda laughed when they forgot one of the things we ordered and had to bring it - gasp - separately! Take that, Symon! :)

Anyway, I realize I'm being really bitchy about B Spot.  But the reason I am giving it four stars is because when I started eating, I was in a trance. The burgers are REALLY good.  The fries are too. The onion rings were good for like 1or 2 and then I got a bit sick of them (but that's always how it is with me and onion rings).  The simple salad was actually cold, crisp, and delicious, although forgotten at first by the server. (One tip - add some balsamic vinegar, which is on every table - to the salad to add sweetness if desired.) 

Aside from the variety of dipping stuff at each table, there is also a ""bar"" of different condiments (not sure exactly what besides pickles) which I wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole, if not merely for the principle of not having to do this at a ""high end"" restaurant, then the ""fear of H1N1"" factor.

I had the Thin Lizzy, which was a cheeseburger with grilled onions, mayo, and pickles. DAY-um! It was awesome.  My husband had the Lola, which had fried egg and some other stuff I can't remember. He loved it.

For dessert we ordered shakes to go. They got not one, but BOTH of our orders wrong. We ordered a chocolate (for me) and a vanilla apple pie bacon (ew! for him). We got brought a chocolate and a chocolate/banana/marshmallow. Or that's what I thought, until I tried mine when we got home and it was actually another chocolate/banana/marshmallow. Well, it was still delicious, but it pissed me off a bit that in an establishment that is outwardly so thoughtful about its production process, and so condescending (even in a joking manner) to their customers about it, they made three mistakes with our order.

I'm not sure if we will return soon, but we probably will eventually."
Ytjon2aVUm09CMdfGJxZYg,"Fellow yelper Will S. told me once that he waits until visiting an establishment more than once to review it. I'm glad I waited to review Bac, because now I can give a bit of a broader review.

We went to Bac twice, once about a month ago, and once yesterday. Both were on a Saturday night. Both times, the crowd was vibrant, young, and hip. Usually, I stay away from places like this, but the feel was casual, and the food is REALLY good.

Here's a total list of what we ate, with some notes:

Appetizers: 
Green papaya salad with basil and cilantro - light, sweet, but not too filling (a negative if you are starving). A friend who also came here since Bac opened said she preferred how this salad tasted at the Taste of Tremont (they have made some changes to it since then).

Garden salad with romaine, pears, carrots, red onion, toasted almonds, and miso-soy vinagrette- the perfect salad! Ask for dressing on the side because it has a strong flavor.

Summer rolls- not worth it unless you are on some kind of weird raw food diet. Too squishy and had too much pasta inside. Kind of bland.

Edamame- par for the course. Very good.

Sandwiches:
-Bahn Mi sandwich with Sweet potato tempura fries - so not my cup of tea, but my husband loved every bite.

Main courses:
-Basil fried rice (with tofu)- really mild, great flavors, fresh vegetables, generous portion.

-Pad thai- really good, not outstanding, but better than some in the area, including Ty Fun. Really tasty, hot chicken in this dish, as well as some sweet cabbage on top- a nice touch. Carrots were also flavored in what I think is the same miso-soy dressing as they put on the salad. It's more of a ""wet,"" slippery pad thai than a dry/sticky one. I prefer the latter, but it was still very good (and EXTREMELY large).

-Pan-seared scallops and shitake mushrooms in a plum-wine reduction sauce, served with roasted asparagus and steamed rice - again, I would probably never order this, so I'm glad my husband likes different stuff than I do. He loved the flavor of the sauce, but thought the scallops were a bit stringy and hard to chew.

Dessert:
-Green Tea ice cream - AMAZING, and served on the house (see below for the reason why).

Drinks:
-Being a pregster, I was really really jealous of everyone drinking the two times we came. They have the perfect menu of summer drinks to enjoy in a slightly warm environment (or outside on the patio). Granted, most of the ones on the menu seem a bit ""girly"" (i.e., fruity), but my husband loved the one he got (can't remember the name, but it had lychee fruit in it). For those not partaking in alcohol, they have an INSANE amount of fruit juices, including obsure ones like guava, papaya, and coconut. I requested a mixture of orange and mango juices both times, and they honored my request at no additional charge.

Decor:
Really cool. Green accents and stuff. Ceiling fans. Loved the bathroom. (Obviously I am not too into interior design)

Service:
Here is where it gets strange. Everyone, from the hostesses to the wait staff to the chef himself, are really really nice. However, the service was spotty. The first time we went, we were in and out within an hour (but of course, we were not rushed out). But yesterday, it was just crazy. We arrived around 7:30 and didn't leave until almost 10. It did seem as though there were a lot of big parties there last night, but we did get seated right away (and there were a lot of empty tables left). We kept getting ""waited on,"" but not served our food. We got our salads in about 25 minutes and then had to wait an additional hour for our entrees. The waitress did apologize several times, and was very nice about it, but then didn't remember to bring me a fork when I asked for it (I'm a little bit chopstick-deficient - and they are slippery plastic, not wood).

We were totally pissed until the chef himself came out and apologized to us. He then proceeded to go around to every table and apologize for what was going on. He came by a second time to explain that everyone just came in at once and they got -and I quote - ""owned in the kitchen."" That made me smile. But the kicker was when he brought us each a service of the amazingly delicious green tea ice cream to make up for it.

So we left feeling really happy even though we were annoyed a bit earlier. I guess all's well that ends well...let's face it, we are easily won over by ice cream. We look forward to going back, because of the exceptionally kind and professional way the chef handled the situation. And because the food is really good!"
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"We celebrated a friend's promotion here last night.  If you're going to dine here, I would strongly suggest a reservation.  We had one and we still weren't seated on time.  

It's a unique experience as it's underground.  However, that does make for a pretty crowded space all around.   There seemed to be quite a few people that were there just to hang out in the bar and given the limited space and mild sense of claustrophobia, that is not something I would choose to do.  

The drinks were done well and they have a great selection of spirits at the bar.  The complimentary bread is tasty but the pieces are huge.  Our crab cake starter might well have been my favorite item.  It's super extra crabby and in this case, that is a plus!  

They have a case with ""live"" lobsters but I suspect these guys had at least one claw in the dish.  (That, or they all have a terrible case of the thorazine shuffle.)  My lobster was prepared well enough but it was fairly chewy.  My steak was delicious but it was prepared medium rare rather than the medium I requested.  (Thankfully, the lighting was low which made it difficult to see the clear evidence of murder on my plate.)  The amaretto cheesecake was tasty and you get a little glass of amaretto with it.  

It's hard for me to balk at prices because they're serving fish in the desert.  But know that it's going to be a pretty spendy evening.   

Given that some of our favorite restaurants are just down the road in Old Town, I would probably not choose to come here again.  It was a fun evening and I recommend coming at least once but for me, it won't be a repeat experience."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"This review for the pharmacy.  I think there are a few stand-out employees there but as a whole, they are terrible.  

I have several prescriptions that have co-pay assistance.  After repeated issues with having them run the script through my insurance first and the co-pay assistance second, they finally told me that I would have to call every single time I filled one of those scripts and have them manually run it through the co-pay assistance.  

This was unacceptable so I moved all of my regular scripts to an independent pharmacy (Valley of the Sun Pharmacy) and my experience there has been stellar.  

I've continued to fill one-off scripts there for convenience sake but service has still been terrible.  On Monday, I picked up two scripts.  They had run one through my insurance but not the other.  (WHY????).  Yesterday, I picked up two scripts and they had run NEITHER of them through my insurance.  

This morning, I had to pick up something else and I stood there visibly and passive aggressively jangling my keys while employees bustled behind the counter, helped drive through customers and did everything but look to see if a customer was waiting.  

I've also had several interactions with a pharm tech who was grossly inappropriate.  

*reading the name of the medication* ""What's this for?"" INAPPROPRIATE.  

""Wow, you have really good insurance.  What does that cost per month?""  INAPPROPRIATE. 

""This medication is for _____.  Is that what you take it for?  Does that help you?""  INAPPROPRIATE.  

After the most recent experiences, I think I might drive the half mile down the road to Albertson's.  Ridiculous."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"We are at the Esplanade frequently and this place has caught my eye a number of times.  When a coupon came up, I jumped on it and we went.  

The value of the coupon was terrific - appetizers, main dishes, desserts, and a bottle of wine for two people for $50.  I started with the cheese plate and it was an eyeful!  Much bigger than expected and I shared with my two dining companions.  My companions were also pleased with their choices of meatballs and pork belly.  I wanted the smoked risotto sans pork belly because I am a pig snob and they were happy to oblige.  They brought it on the side so the rest of my table could nosh on pig heaven.  The risotto was delicious and very interesting.  I don't know that I would have put those two flavors together but it worked very well.    

My only criticism of the food is the desserts.  My companions ordered the pumpkin budino.  I sampled a small bite and the caramel sauce tasted a bit grainy as if the sugar hadn't dissolved all the way.  My red velvet cake was a good start but was disappointing.  It was dense as red velvet cake should be (which can almost make it a bit dry) but that's why you have cream cheese icing.  It marries everything beautifully.  SOLO served it sans frosting but with mascarpone gelato and ""ganache"" which was a literal smear and didn't add anything.  Honestly, I just didn't care for the combination but I was way too codependent to tell the waiter. 

All in all, we enjoyed ourselves immensely.  The service was great, ambiance was nice and it was just a nice meal all around.  Truthfully, I don't crave Italian food very often but I would come here again."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"We attended the mixology class here yesterday and this review is for the class.  

Apparently it was supposed to be in the Jade bar and we were supposed to have the hands-on experience of making our own drinks.  Their website even states that class size is limited to 10.  Unfortunately, this is not what happened.  There were at least 20 people there and they moved us into a room adjacent to the restaurant.  We watched our host make drinks and waitresses brought us those same drinks that were pre-made in the kitchen.  

For me, part of the enjoyment of these kinds of events is learning something new.  I am much more likely to make things myself at home if I've done it in a class.  All we got to do was watch the guy make drinks and it honestly wasn't much different than the nights I've spent at The Merc Bar watching the bartenders make magic (and I have to say, their bartenders are TALENTED... this guy.. not so much). 

Our bartender seemed like a very nice guy but honestly, he wasn't a very good speaker and he didn't even really seem that knowledgeable about booze.  

The value of the class is pretty good - for $30, you get 4 drinks.  It would have been a superb deal had we been able to actually make the drinks.  And the drinks were delightful.  

Our tables had brochures with drink recipes that were in the same style of things being made in class but were not what we were served.  I found this confusing.  In other classes we've done, we received handouts with the recipes that were covered.  

The resort itself is beautiful and I thoroughly enjoyed the time we spent there.  I just don't feel like we got what we paid for.  :("
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"We checked out this House O' Seafood last night and here's what we thought...  

The interior is beautifully decorated and fancypants - check out the lighting!  

My husband noted that although the servers seem to have been well trained, there was a finesse that was missing... almost as if we know what we're doing but we're not quite comfortable doing it yet.  

The pre-dinner rolls they bring are a deliciously bougie version of Hungry Jack Biscuits.  Eat one or two and take the rest home.  

I live in Scottsdale and am used to the ""Scottsdale Premium"" of higher restaurant prices but I think Ocean 44 takes it a bit too far.  $18 for a mixed drink that has lots of ice feels like a gouge... even in Scottsdale.  A really good martini can justify (barely) $18 but a mixed drink?  Nope.  (I am an unbashed foodie and will happily drop coin on good food...  but it needs to feel worth it for me to do it again.) 

My Chilean Sea Bass was fresh, buttery and practically fell off the plate into my mouth.  For my preferences, it was a tad underseasoned BUT... BUT... BUT... Ocean 44 puts salt and pepper on the table so I can season to my heart's delight without looking like an asshole.  Husband and I shared a side of the scallop gnocchi.  Can't say I've had a fried scallop before the dish works as a whole.  

We also shared the warm caramel cake for dessert and it's just as good as it looks.  The cake is dense although it doesn't technically need a sauce, I kept wanting it to have one.    

We had a lovely experience and if you're jonesing for a fresh piece of fish, Ocean 44 will not steer you wrong.  That being said, I'm not sure it was enough to bring me back."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"We are long time fans of Kevin Binkley.  If he opened a restaurant in the men's bathroom at a Walmart, we would go.  If he served us pate swimming in deer urine, we would eat it.  We surrender our taste buds to his will as often as our wallets and waistlines will allow.  

Bink's Midtown in casual joint tucked away in an almost-residential area.  It's small, cozy, and intimate.  Parking is pretty much valet only (unless you want to get vehicularly creative) so bring a few bucks for a tip.  

The drinks were fantastic.  The Farmer's Market Margarita was possibly the most complex margarita I've ever tasted.  Magical tequila, cilantro, jalepeno, and other goodness in an unassuming glass - yes, please.  The Strawberry Basil Lemonade was good - dangerously good.  

My appetizer of beef risotto was delicious.  Served with a dollop of creme fraiche, it was interesting and untraditional.  My company raved about their octopus and plate of bone marrow.  

The sand dabs cooked with brown butter and almonds were out of this world.  Crispy on the outside and ridiculously tender on the inside... these folks know what to do with sea creatures.  

My husband enjoyed the bolognese (which he's had many times at Cafe Bink) but was not as fond of this iteration.  It was made with a garlic bread pudding and he felt there was just too much butter.  (Apparently, too much butter is a thing.)  My chocolate puddin' cake was tasty but not jaw droppingly interesting or delicious.  It felt like it was missing a little something.  

Our server was wonderful.  Friendly, present without hovering, and quick to offer a suggestion.  

We truly enjoyed ourselves and look forward to coming back."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"We've used Sparkle Tech three times and the first two experiences were superb - they did a great job, arrived on time, were polite and personable and offered a seven day rain guarantee.  (Which is why we continued to call them.)  This last time, they again arrived promptly, were polite and personable and it was consistent with our previous two experiences.  Shortly after our cleaning, we noticed large scratches on our picture windows that face east.  Those windows pretty much ""sell"" the house and having them scratched is unacceptable.  

We noticed these scratches shortly before departing on an extended trip and in order to address the matter promptly, I asked my best friend and house-sitter to contact them.  Their policy states they are not responsible for damage once they've left the property.  While I understand this from a legal perspective, it's not in the least advantageous to the consumer because you can't necessarily see issues immediately because of the sun's position (which was why we discovered the scratches in the morning).  

My best friend contacted the company who did come out to view the damage but they continued to insist that they didn't cause it.  As a satisfactory solution wasn't reached, my friend scheduled a phone call with the owner who adamantly denied their equipment couldn't have caused the scratches.  Honestly, I believe their equipment doesn't cause scratches but Arizona being windy and full of gravel, it's easy to imagine a piece getting caught in the equipment.  My friend has relayed that the owner told her never to contact his business again and hung up on her.  

Disappointing end to a previously positive business relationship."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"Let me disclose that I'm something of a professional patient and I have pretty high standards for my healthcare since I just have the one life.  :)  A neighbor recommended him and his online reviews (Vitals and Healthgrades) were off the charts.  

Dr. Vishteh spends much of time in trauma surgery and his private patient practice is rather small.  His is a small office which means there are less people to do things but the personal experience is overall better.  His assistant, Dana, is also a key component of his practice and she is fantastic.  He only sees patients on Wednesdays so he's not the easiest guy to see.  (Buuuut...  I needed neck surgery and since I have just the one neck...)   

Dr. Vishteh is personable, kind, compassionate and a great listener.  My hospital experience was everything he and Dana promised it would be.  He came to see me before surgery, after surgery and the following morning.  While I was in pre-op, the anesthesiologist leaned over and pointed to a scar on his neck.  He said ""Dr. Vishteh did my surgery and I don't know how you found him but you're in the best of hands.""  This was precisely the kind of thing I needed to hear before heading to the operating room.  

My surgery was two weeks ago today and I walked 3.5 miles this morning.  I would never have guessed I'd be so functional after cervical spine surgery.  It's going to be a long road with healing and recovery but I'm off to an amazing start.  

One bit of feedback for the office: Make some handouts for pre-op and post-op.  I felt a bit unprepared a few times and had the call the office with questions.  

If you're having a problem in your neck, I cannot recommend Dr. Vishteh enough.  He's truly a gem."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"A few friends and I have committed to trying a new place once a month or so.  This was our first field trip and it was a worthy destination.  

Up in the hills of north-north Scottsdale, Sassi is in the shadow of the Pinnacle Peak mountains.  The property itself is gorgeous and very much feels like a wedding venue (and it apparently is!).  

Enormous leather chairs and distinctive rooms give this place a very lodge-y homey feel.  

Drinks were fantastic.  If you're a fan of both tart and sweet, you can't go wrong with the limoncello martini.  The table shared a few apps...  the octopus (which I didn't have but am told it was excellent), the caprese salad and the meatballs.  

The caprese salad is possibly one of the best I've ever had.  Moist, flavorful mozzarella atop seasoned heirloom tomatoes, basil and fancy pants olive oil - yes, please.  

Although not touted as one of their ""specialties,"" my scallops were amazing.  Again, quite possibly some of the best scallops I've ever had. There was a delicate lemon flavor and when combined with the peppery greens, it was an intense and unique flavor combination.  

This is a destination meal.  Don't ""stop by"" for quick before a show or other engagement.  Make this your main event.  

There was one aspect of evening that was slightly off putting.  Our reservations indicated that we had one dairy-sensitive and one gluten-free person.  The menus were clearly designed to address food allergies and that was wonderful.  However, gregarious and friendly as our server was, he did not have a good grasp on what ""gluten free"" meant.  I think servers have a responsibility to educate themselves (or be educated) about what specific food allergies encompass so that they may make accurate menu suggestions."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"If I could add fireworks and shooting stars to this review, I would.  These guys saved the evening last night for my friend's birthday.  

After a scheduling snafu at The Blue Hound, The Arrogant Butcher graciously accepted our party of 20.  I was dubious about how the service would be due to the large group, but they exceeded my expectations.  We had a dedicated server who was extremely nice and resembled a cheery Christmas Hobbit.  Drinks came out fairly quickly and after a short wait at the bar, we were shown to a private dining room.  

The have a really adventurous cocktail menu so if you're feeling brave, give it a go.  Bring your smartphone as you may have to google many of the ingredients (I enjoy exposure to new things so this is definitely a plus for me).  

The pretzel fondue appetizer is heaven on earth encased in doughy salty cheesy goodness.  The chicken stroganoff was pretty fantastic as well and they get extra points for house made pasta.  I found it odd but charming that the menu listed ""frozen peas.""  (More points for honesty!)  My dining companions seemed very pleased with their meals and one person was especially enthusiastic about the mussels and oysters.  

Desserts were fantastic as well.  The warm peanut butter cup is nothing short of amazing.  It's the kind of thing you would say is ""just okay"" in order to avoid sharing.  The salted caramel pudding was delicious as well.  (And if you all could turn that salted caramel pudding into bread pudding, I will personally head up a new religion devoted to it.)  

I learned about this restaurant a couple of years ago at the Devoured event and it's been on my to-do list.  Although we didn't set out to dine here last night, I'm certainly glad we did.  Thank you Arrogant Butchers!"
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"I'm an avid concert-goer and have spent a LOT of money at the Marquee in both drinks and tickets.  The Marquee isn't a bad place to see a show - it's just not my favorite.  

However, this update is targeted to their new ""VIP"" section.  A month or two back, I received an email saying we could upgrade our concert tickets from GA to VIP for only $10.  The email promised a dedicated bathroom, bar and some seating.  We thought ""Why not?"" and forked over the extra funds for the VIP experience.  (The email also intimated that this was a special low price because it's a new offering and would likely be significantly more expensive in the future).  

The whole thing was a bust.  The bar was nice although I've never had an issue getting a drink downstairs.  Dedicated bathrooms were also nice but my friends still had to wait in line (usually the case downstairs too).  We spotted some booth bench seating  and headed towards it only to be stopped by security and told it was ""$100 a head"" to sit there.  Asssphincter says what?  $100 a head to sit on a freakin' bench?  Are you kidding me?  Apparently, we were important but not THAT important.    

At that point, our only option was to stand two people deep because the front standing spots were taken.  

So, we took our $10-extra-dollar-VIP-asses and went down to GA.  We were literally right next to the bar AND we had a much better view.  

Years ago, Marquee used to have a VIP section on the right as you walk in.  It was a roped off section on the floor with a dedicated bartender.  That was nice and worth paying for.  I was disappointed when they stopped doing it.   

Bottom line - don't waste your money on VIP.  Even for sold out shows (as last night was), you can STILL have a better experience on the floor."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"If allowed, I would give 3.5 stars.  We dined here Friday evening and had the tasting menu.  My feelings about the experience are mixed.  

As mentioned in a previous review, the place IS small.  If you're looking to discuss your upcoming wart removal, you may want to save that convo for a different venue.  However, as small as it is, it never got very loud which made it easy to chat with my companions.  

A previous reviewer mentioned the boxed Franzia wine in the kitchen.  I noted that as well but it seems like they're cooking with it and not serving it.  Our waiter made a wine suggestion that I quite enjoyed.  Two of my companions got the wine pairing and raved about the selections.  

The flavors and combinations of some of the dishes were inventive, experimental, and at times downright brilliant.  It is the sort of creativity that I have enjoyed at Binkley's many times.  There was one major stumble though - the awful pink and orange mess of the seafood dish with the shrimp and the clams.  I applaud the creativity in pairing strawberry mousse with seafood but visually, it doesn't work.  I didn't find that the flavors worked very well but truthfully, I was really distracted by the garish presentation.  I also did not care for the gelatin dessert but my dining companions quite enjoyed it.  

My major, major issue with our evening there was the silverware.  With each course, we were asked to keep our silverware which I think is tacky.  Where it went from bad to worse is when the dessert courses came and we were eating flourless chocolate cake with the same fork that had made sweet love to artichokes, mushrooms, cauliflower and duck.  Ewww.   

I honestly don't know if I'd come here again.  I'd say it's worth a visit but bring your own silverware.  ;)"
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"We came back for dinner on Friday evening and it was everything I hoped it would be. 

If you're an alcoholic...err... ""alcohol aficionado"", this is the place for you.  They offer barrel aged cocktails which is a truly unique experience.  They're a bit spendy at regular price but if you go during ""Social Hour"", they're half price and a steal (note to CPH: I appreciate not being forced to be happy.  Thanks for validating the preferences of pissy people everywhere.)  The term ""craft cocktails"" is starting to go the way of  sun-dried tomatoes (sad and overused), but currently there isn't a better description and this is definitely a destination for a twist on the sauce.  If my husband were granted full access to their bar and nifty ingredients, I might never see him again.  (But granted, it's been a good run.)  

We ordered the mac n' cheese, chicken and waffle, and crab cakes for appetizers.  All were fantastic.  I thought the chicken and waffle was a strange offering but an app but it works.  For din-din, our table had the short ribs, filet, duck, and meatloaf.  Six loud tipsy people were quiet for maybe an entire minute which should tell you something.  Desserts were an exercise in competitive eating but we managed.  Our table had the pumpkin bread pudding, apple pie and dream pudding.  YUM.  We then accomplished a gastronomic feat by indulging in their house-made egg nog.  It was a thick, creamy, delicious glass of shame.      

The service was fantastic.  Our waiter was friendly, funny and engaging.  They did a wonderful job of taking care of us without hovering.  

I'm not the biggest fan of Old Town thanks to the douche bag/Ax factor but this is definitely a compelling reason to make my way through guys in too tight t-shirts who say ""dude"" excessively."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"Parma is so, so close to being fantastic. It falls short in a few key areas that will (or should) be resolved with time.  

Note that if you're looking for a quiet little Italian joint, this is not where you want to be.  It was loud and hopping at 6 p.m. on a Friday night - standing room only in the bar.  The tables are WAY too close together and I'm tired of restaurants seating patrons in a consecutive line like sardines.  It wouldn't be as much of an issue if the tables weren't so close together.  Dessert or not, I had to shimmy to get in and out from my booth seat and I was thankful we didn't have a ""table neighbor"" or they might have lost a glass of wine.  

The charred broccolini was extremely well seasoned and the arrabiatta was fantastic but charred?  Can we talk about charred?  These little darlings were exposed to heat for but a short time.  I couldn't actually cut through them with my knife.  

Our server recommended the bread and she was on target - it was fantastic.  Although this isn't comped bread, it is worth it.  It comes with a generous serving of oil, vinegar and mascarpone cheese. 

My campanelle was almost perfection but alas, it was underseasoned and I had a heck of a time getting enough salt on it.  Husband's bolognase was also lovely but he too felt it was very much underseasoned.  

I can't drink right now and asked for a mocktail.  The bartender made me a ""strawberry flower"" served up in a martini glass - it was delicious and beautiful. 

I come from an Italian family and have a sense of ""home cooked"" Italian food.  Parma is definitely on track.  The pasta was a bit on the greasy side which subtracts from the elegance.  

The TakeAway: Remove a table or two, have a heavier hand with seasoning and scale back the fat a tiny bit...  This place will be absolute magic."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"I've been coming here for several years with no complaint... until recently.  My change in review comes not from a single incident but from multiple inconsistencies that simply have left me feeling uncomfortable pursuing long-term and expensive dental work with this practice. 

I have two bridges that are coming due for replacement and I've been talking to Dr. Cook about that since late last year.  The first time we spoke about bridge replacement, he said we would continue stick with the same type of bridges I have now.  The second time we spoke, he said that we would do a more conventional bridge.  We also discussed at length re-making my sleep apnea oral appliance because A) my current appliance is somewhat uncomfortable and B) the shape of bridges will almost certainly be different.  That same day,  I spoke with a patient coordinator who said she would send me an estimate.  I emphasized to her that the estimate would need to include remaking the sleep apnea appliance.  

I never got an estimate and had to call to request it.  I finally got the estimate but it didn't include the sleep apnea appliance.  When I contacted the patient coordinator, she said she spoke with Dr. Cook and he was planning to retro-fit it.  I was also told at that point they may or may not be able to submit the sleep apnea appliance through major medical because Dr. Cook was currently in training for sleep apnea appliances.  (Note to sleep apnea patients: most medical insurances WILL cover these appliances but it has to go through major medical - not dental.)  

This is going to be a long and expensive process and the recent inconsistencies prompted me to seek out another dental practice to do the bridge work.  For the amount of time and money this is going to require, I want to feel like everyone is on the same page."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"We tried to check this place out the weekend of ComiCon but it was packed and the hostess recommended a reservation.  So, we waited a few weeks and did exactly that.  I read the Yelp reviews and was ""ready"" for some issues.  The first half hour or so was fabulous and I was all set to write a those-people-are-whiny-bastards review.  And then things went downhill.  

The good: Drinks are fantastic.  The drink menu is a small novel and the first two pages are the owner's creations.  Between the five of us, we sampled nearly all of them.  Innovative, fresh and well balanced - a cocktail enthusiast's dream.  We ordered a number of things off the menu and overall, it was tasty but the food doesn't hold a candle to the cocktails.  

The bad: I'd say the ""service"" needs work but we were pretty sure it was just our server.  We ordered the corn dip without bread crumbs to accomodate a gluten-intolerant person in our party.  Literally, a half hour went by and the dip hadn't arrived and we asked the waitress who assured us she put the order in.  The dip came out about ten minutes later and it was obvious that she'd forgotten to put it in AND it had bread crumbs on it.  People make mistakes and that's totally cool.  But what bothered us most is that she didn't own up to it.  Her attitude changed after we asked about the corn dip and she seemed pissy and short.  She then proceeded to screw up a very simple bill split and we ended up having the manager fix it.      

We did speak to the manager about the above issues and he was extremely apologetic, appreciative of our feedback and very friendly.  

Will I go back?  If the ""need reservations"" thing is always, it's unlikely.  There are plenty of places to drink at CityScape that don't require reservations and I have not yet reached the point where I can justify (or want to justify) reservations just to have drinks."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"According to Yelp, I've checked in here 27 times.  Yesterday just might be my last.  As I've stated in previous reviews, we pretty much only come to Esplanade which is about a 40 minute drive from my house.  

Despite a few bad experiences, we've patronized the Esplanade theater since it opened.  We used to love to go there for dinner and drinks while enjoying a movie.  The food went downhill so we started skipping meals there and eating elsewhere before or after.  The drinks were never terribly good (way too sweet and stingy pours) so we started going elsewhere for that too.  (Beer and cider are safe but the cider never changes.)  

Yesterday, we arrived at our Cinema Suites theater to find our seats and seating area filthy.  There was popcorn in the cupholders.  The table area between the sets of two was full of crumbs.  The floor appeared to be dirty as well - I kept my purse in my lap during the movie.  I was tempted to contact a manager right then but the movie was starting and I didn't want to miss it.  

I also requested water and never got it. 

Additionally, two of our three purchased seats had tears and were taped over.  The theater is showing obvious signs of wear and tear which really detracts from the ""luxury experience"" of having recliners and no children.  

I did speak with a manager after the show and he seemed very disinterested.  I explained that I was a long time customer and explained the issues.  He clarified which theater it was and said he would have someone take a look at it.  No apology.  No contriteness.  Nothing. 

Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed in our experience and even more so at the lack of interest from the manager.  Everybody can have a bad day and maybe someone missed cleaning that theater... that's where the manager comes in.  An apology and a remote interest in keeping a customer would have gone a long way."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"They teach you that when you're about to give bad news, you should start with something positive, right?  Here's the good...

The chips and salsa were really good.  The chips were extra salty and I was happy they arrived that way rather than me pouring on salt like I'm waiting for a heart attack.  The margarita was delicious and at happy hour prices, it's a steal.  The queso and sopas were tasty as well.  The bread pudding was also yummy.

And the bad...  

Things were not terribly well seasoned and there were no salt shakers on the tables. Perhaps it's an oversight but tables with no salt shakers are a sign of arrogance.  This is acceptable at places with gourmet food...at your neighborhood Mexican joint?  Not so much.  

Where things really fell down for me was the service.  There seem to be general chaos where the servers were concerned.  Our waiter, although he was very, very nice, seemed extremely distracted.  I noticed other tables (all in the bar section) experiencing poor service as well.  Food went to the wrong table.  The wrong check went to the wrong table.  We waited an inexcusably long time for more tortilla chips and my husband had to ask for them twice.  Our drinks sat empty for a very long time.  We even pushed our empty glasses to the edge of the table to indicate that we were not finished medicating ourselves.  Everything took far longer than it should have.  

The other thing that bothered me were inconsistencies between what was on the menu/what our waiter described and what came out.  The menu stated the bread pudding came with rum raisin ice cream (yes, please!).  It arrived with vanilla bean ice cream.  The waiter stated that it came with a blueberry sauce but it arrived with what was clearly a raspberry sauce.  It was still a tasty dessert but I like things to arrive as advertised.    

I think this place has potential but they have some work to do."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"I am ex Wells Fargo customer.  Years ago, they started charging me for a billpay service that had previously been free.  I called to cancel the service only to find they charged me a fee for speaking to someone to cancel the service.  Needless to say, I took my money elsewhere and haven't looked back.  

On occasion, I have checks from Wells Fargo and as there is a location near my house, it is convenient to stop there and cash them.  Up until today, they have been cool about it and haven't harassed me too much about becoming a customer.  

They've followed suit with Chase and now make you go through this ridiculous ""check verification"" process.  The teller sends me over to another teller where I wait in line behind Cowboy Bob who is talking incessantly about his grandchildren.  I wait and I wait and I wait.  About 15 minutes go by and I start attempting to telekinetically staple the tellers to their desks.  One of the tellers notices that I am getting angry and may possibly have a gun in my purse so he sends another teller up to help me.  

As the guy is verifying the check, he asks me if this is a business check.  I say ""It's just a personal check.""  He says ""No, what I mean is did someone pay you for a service?""  

What I want to say: 

""Yes, I am a very expensive prostitute.""  

What I do say: 

""It's just a personal check.""  

He then asks me if I'm happy with my bank.  I say that I am and he proceeds to ask me why I didn't take my check there.  I reply, ""Because I felt like bringing it here.""  

We do have a local bank that we don't love.  I MIGHT have been open to coming back at some point but if this is how they treat their non-customers, I don't have a lot of hope for how they treat their actual customers.  I would hate to think that someone who has every right to cash a check that I wrote them would be put through this kind of hassle.  

I left before actually stapling a teller to a desk.  This is probably the best possible outcome."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"I started as a patient with Integrative Headache Care early this year in hopes of finding treatment for my migraines.  I found Dr. McCoy to be kind, compassionate and knowledgeable in her field.  She started me on a treatment regimen that I believe has helped me get a handle on my migraines.  

However, I recently decided to leave the practice as I don't honestly care for the way it's structured.  The ""migraine darlings"" right now are the biologic injections (Aimovig, Emgality, etc.).  Insurance companies are only grudgingly starting to cover them now which means that in nearly every case, a prior authorization will be have to be filed for the insurance.  The insurance usually denies it which qualifies the patient for the bridge program provided by the pharmaceutical company.  As a chronically sick person, I am very familiar with prior authorizations and deal with them all the time.  

IHC charges $35 to file prior authorization paperwork.  This is the first time I've ever been charged by a doctor's office to do a prior authorization form and it didn't sit well with me.  I am presently under care for a severe immune disease and chronic sinus disease - those specialists write prior auths constantly and have never charged me.  Additionally, those specialists do follow-up and there was no follow up here.  Essentially, they charged me $35 to get me on the Emgality bridge program which is free.  

I'm pretty certain they outsource all insurance filings which is the reason for the cost of the paperwork.  As a chronically sick person, I meet my deductible and out of patient by April of every calendar year.  They're sending me bills for a visit that is covered - they just need to refile it.  When I tried to talk to the front desk person about this, I was given a phone number to call.  

Those factors coupled with the utter hassle of seeing a doctor in Scottsdale Quarter (it's barely worth dealing with for fun reasons) have led me to seek a new provider."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"Getting my most recent prescription filled was one of the frustrating experiences I have ever had.  My doctor sent over a new prescription to put my medication in capsules.  I had a five minute conversation with a pharmacist who insisted that they had never ""in the entire history of the company"" done it that way.  I told him I had a bottle in my hands from Avella.  He insisted it must have come from a different pharmacy.  I read him the prescription number and what do you know... he found it AND they *had* put my medication for me in capsules - multiple times.  

The next step was convincing them I did not want six giant capsules to mix up a gallon at a time.  The whole point of having capsules is that they are much easier and convenient for travel.  

Once they finally understood that I wanted 60 capsules, they were unsure of the price.  I spoke with one pharmacist who said he would call me right back and received a call from a woman about 25 minutes later informing me I had a prescription in progress.  Clearly, the left hand isn't even aware that there's a right hand.  

I've been using Avella off and on for years and they've never charged me for delivery.  Today, they tell me there's now a $10 fee.  

On top of that, my interactions with the pharmacists were not pleasant.  They seemed annoyed at having to deal with me and customer service and satisfaction were sorely lacking.  

And additionally, the last two times they delivered to me, there were issues.  In December, they told me it would be delivered on a specific day.  I stayed home all day to wait for the prescription and it didn't arrive until the next day.  In November, a woman was trying to deliver my prescription at 10:00 p.m. at night!  Who does that?    

I deal with a myriad of doctors and pharmacies.  I just don't have the patience any more to fight over getting a freakin' prescription filled.  I'll be shopping for a new compounding pharmacy that places a higher importance on customer service and continuity."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"We came here last weekend for a friend's birthday.  We had a lovely experience but I think there are a few things that could use some tweaking.  

Husband loved the bourbon flights as it's his favorite spirit.  They certainly have an impressive list and many which we'd not heard of it.  On the menu, the mention of the flight was in a relatively small box that I happened to see (husband did not).  Advertise this more - it's in your name!  :) 

The cocktails were delicious.  I managed to get two WTFs down - very yummy.  We did find it curious that they use actual honey (which doesn't dissolve well unless the beverage is warm) instead of honey syrup.  It coagulated at the bottom which didn't detract at all - it was just an odd choice.  

Despite being warned that our entrees would come with a deviled egg, we ordered them as appetizers and they were outstanding.  (I was happy to eat my ""garnish"" egg when it arrived too.)  

We were served an amuse bouche of potato croquette that they called a ""hush puppy"".  I appreciate the gesture but collectively, we found the faux puppies bland.  

I sampled a friend's crab cake and it was fabulous.  I also sampled a friend's lobster mac n' cheese and it was delicious as well. 

I ordered the grouper and it certainly tasted like this sucker had been alive only moments ago.  It was extraordinarily fresh (and I've eaten grouper just plucked out of the gulf).  Definitely high quality fish but could use a little more seasoning.  (Or I probably should have asked for salt and pepper.)  After asking about a gluten issue, we learned that the fries are pan fried with each order and they are fabulous.  I don't generally recommend getting fries at higher end places but that goes out the window here - get them.  

I have no words for the desserts.  I would come here just for the desserts.  For my friend's birthday, they brought some kind of bar with salted caramel on it that was amazing.  We also ordered the chocolate rum cake which was fabulous as well. 
 
We look forward to returning!"
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"As long time fans of Binkley's in Cave Creek, Kevin Binkley has nailed the part of that experience that I longed for more of.  He's taken the joy of eating his incredible creations and paired that with a ""dinner party"" setting where each part of the evening takes place in a different area of the house.  

On several jaunts to Cave Creek, we sat at the bar mostly to be able to watch him work through the pass window.  We also had a few chats with him this way and that was always one of the most special parts of those evenings.  The ""new"" Binkley's capitalizes on this as guests have unfettered access to him, the kitchen and pretty much anywhere in the house.  Guests are invited to wander through the kitchen, ask questions and and geek out to their hearts' desires.  

Our meal was pure Binkley's perfection.  Each course was presented beautifully and although everything was not necessarily to my tastes, I recognize the thought, precision and love that went into every bite.  

Even more impressive was the accommodation of our hard-to-feed group with one pescatarian, one dairy-free person and one gluten-nut-nightshade-free person.  He did an absolutely beautiful job bringing out similar versions that jibbed with our nutritional issues.  He mentioned how he hated when someone had an allergy or a preference, that person's dish was often radically different than what others received.  Not so here - not only do they accomodate any and everything, they seem to welcome the challenge. 

There was a moment in the evening when I was nearly brought to tears by being able to witness Binkley's passion, dedication and creativity to his art.  He makes every guest feel like a longtime friend and his enthusiasm for ingredients and cooking is contagious.  

One possible recommendation: it's a LOT of food and although I'm not a big wine person, I opted to do the sommelier pairing (which was fantastic and totally worth it).  However, unless you're a professional competitive eater, you may want to consider splitting the wine pairing with a friend.  Several glasses went unfinished and I felt terrible about this given that there are sober people in the world...  

I cannot wait to come back."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"I'm a hotel whore.  Incidentally in Vegas once or twice a year, I delight in trying new hotels.  I have no loyalty to any hotel, brand or amenity.  

This may have all changed.  Meeting a girlfriend in Vegas to celebrate my birthday, she chose to stay at The Aria so I stayed there too to make things easier. 

Oh, the joys of a modern hotel.  Visible and easily accessible plugs on the nightstand for my phone and Kindle.  A nightstand safe for laptops that is super easy to operate.  A nightstand control panel for damn near everything in my room. Lots of nooks and crannies for storage, suitcases, etc.  Curtains that open and close at the touch of a switch.  No more fumbling with the privacy card as it's just a push of a button.  The complimentary toiletries are NICE (nicer than the ones I brought so I may be squirreling them away for home use).   

I got a fantastic summer rate, they gave me a birthday room upgrade and they hotel delivered a lovely box of macarons to my room.

The room of beautifully decorated and the bed.. oh, the bed... it will swallow you whole.  I don't have plans until this afternoon so I sit cheerfully on my comfy bed, doing a bit of work and enjoying the gorgeous view.  

My room is quiet and the blackout curtains do a wonderful job of letting me sleep when I want to sleep.  

There are a couple areas they could improve:  

Check-in was dreadfully slow.  I probably waited in line for a half hour.  (To be fair, it was exacerbated by a five hour plane delay...I was quite tired of waiting by that point.)

As it hasn't been convenient to go shopping and buy bottled water, I've been drinking water out of the tap and it's akin to Phoenix water.  I'm reluctantly staying hydrated.  

The mini-fridge that is stocked to the gills with room for nothing else is irritating (although standard Vegas).  You can request another fridge be delivered to your room but that seems silly.  Just leave me a shelf.     

The disinfectant they use distinctly reminds me of my great grandmother's nursing home.  It's a little off putting but only because I have that association. 

I'm here one more night and it's been a lovely, lovely stay so far.  I'm trying to decide if my family would miss me if I didn't come home..."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"I understand that with a first year event there are always kinks to work out.  I certainly don't expect everything to run smoothly.  But REALLY!?!?!  This event was a disaster from start to finish.  

The parking was ridiculous.  Attendees were directed to a dirt lot but if you were approaching from the west (as we were), getting into the lot was via green yield.  Which meant that things backed up.  At some point, we turned around and approached from the other direction which was slightly better.  While waiting in the hellish line, one person went on ahead (on foot) to grab the will-call tickets.  

Eventually, we gave up and parked on 1st street.  Wish we'd done this from the beginning as there was tons of space and it was just a short walk.  

In general, I avoid will-call because it's just one more line to stand in.  But, this event gave us no other option.  The will call lines were crazy long and I was thankful that we had the foresight to send someone ahead.  

Upon getting our bracelets, we learned that there is a limit on alcohol samples - we had eight tickets with our bracelets.  This was never disclosed pre-event.  Unlimited should mean unlimited.  

The lines for samples were ridiculously long.  To add insult to injury, some of the samples were just downright sad.  And waiting in a very long line for two swallows of wine is just not my idea of a good time.  

We happened to note that one restaurant (I forget which one) literally brought a small Weber grill.  Did the organizers not give the restaurants a heads-up on expected attendance or were these guys strangely optimistic? We'll never know.  

When all was said and done, the part that bothered us most of all was that we really didn't feel like we got the value out of our tickets.  If we'd each gone to a restaurant and spent $60, we would have had a really nice meal, a cocktail or two and not been cooking for two hours in the Arizona sun.

The event itself was only three hours long and if you ""wasted"" any event time on signing up for one of many giveaways, watching the band or the cooking demonstrations, or going to the bathroom, that's time you're not standing in line for the next morsel of food.  

The Taste in Tempe is literally just that...  a taste."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"We stayed here recently during the Amazon Web Services conference.  

Husband booked a Tower Suites room and I have to say, I loved having our own private check-in area, lobby, concierge and valet.  It made checking in much more pleasant and getting the car was a breeze.  

The room was beautiful.  Gorgeous floor to ceiling windows with automated open/close buttons for the drapes.  

I saw a review where someone mentioned the toiletries and I have to agree - this hotel was THE best stocked in terms of toiletries that I've seen.  Soap, shower gel, conditioner, shampoo, cotton balls, files, q-tips, shoe polish, shoe polishing cloth, loofah, hairspray, shaving cream... and I know I'm forgetting some.  

I think the Encore restaurants are just okay.  Wasuzu was just okay and Jardin was pretty good.  We meant to make it to Sinatra but never did.    

Every day when we left the room for the first time (whether it was at the crack of dawn or late afternoon), the room was made up by the time we got back.  The cleaning staff was wonderful about organizing my things without moving them.  

The downsides:  

Our room came with a $30 in-room food credit.  This seems like a nice spiff but the reality is that there's an $8 room service charge, plus tax plus a gratuity which leaves you with about 10 actual dollars to spend.  

The room did not have coffee and ordering it from room service was $12.  

It wasn't until I ordered breakfast the first morning that I discovered all of the ""extra"" charges that eat up the $30 room credit and to not disclose that at the get-go feels scammy.  Also, I had happened to see on the website that our room had a room service credit but nothing was ever mentioned to us.  We had to seek someone out and find out what that meant.  

When I did order that first fateful breakfast, she asked what kind of juice I wanted as the coffee came with tea or juice.  On the receipt, my juice was added separately.  My breakfast of a bagel, coffee and green juice came to $47.  I know Vegas is spendy but come on.  I didn't dispute the charge but if the menu says ""juice"", honor that.  And if you're offering me juice that is beyond what the coffee package covers, say so.    

I believe that Wynn guests had a $30 credit at Tableau as well as access to a private lounge serving coffee and pastries.  That seems like a much better deal to me."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"I hired this company to do a move-in/move-out clean for my rental property.  Initial contact was great and I was able to schedule the clean right before my new tenant moved in.  

I explained that I would not be present for the clean and that I would send instructions and photos as to where the crew could find the key.  One business day prior to our appointment, I sent over photos and instructions and was told that they would be added to the work order.  Over the weekend, I had a serious phone malfunction and emailed them with my husband's contact information.  I received a response promptly and I thought we were good to go.  

On the day of the clean, the crew contacted my husband regarding access to the property.  He told them I had provided instructions.  About an hour later, I received a message from an office representative regarding access to the property (receipt of this message was delayed as my phone was malfunctioning).  They wanted to know how to get in the property.  I called them back and again explained that I had sent instructions and photos how to access the property.  

I spent a significant time at the property prior to our appointment and was acutely aware of the shape of the property.  My former tenant was perhaps on the cusp of OCD and the property was in extremely good shape after a three-year occupancy.  There was certainly detail work that needed to be done but I was doubtful the final price would be at the high end of the quote I was given.  I had also inquired about the Yelp discount when scheduling.  

When all was said and done (and my Yelp discount applied), I was pretty much to the dollar at the high end of the quote.  I wondered whether they had charged me for the hour+ the crew sat around *not* cleaning because they didn't have access instructions.  Frankly, it wasn't worth my time to investigate as I had other things to do.  And, full disclosure, I did not end up making it over to the property to check out how they did.  Maybe it was amazing.  Maybe they discovered another dimension in a closet.  I don't know.  

Next time, I will probably try another company.

Edited to respond to owner's comment: I did not recall receiving any GPS reports so I just looked through my mail from your company again and I did not in fact receive a GPS report.  I received an invoice and credit card receipt but no GPS reports."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"This past summer, I was on the hunt for two things: a dentist to redo my bridges and a dentist or orthodontist to make a new sleep apnea oral appliance.  I secured a dentist for the bridges and made an appointment with Dr. Sara for a consult on the oral appliance.  

I was so impressed with Dr. Sara on my appliance consult that I opted to do *everything* (bridges and appliance) with her office.  She is incredibly detail-oriented (mind boggling, actually and if you're a medical geek as I am, it's really cool) and it becomes apparent very quickly that she understands the nuances of how jaw issues can extend throughout the entire body.  I also appreciated that she spoke me with correct medical terms once she realized that I'm pretty well versed with medical technology. 

My bridge consult was similar to my oral appliance consult - the detail and ""reach"" of such a procedure was impressive.  It's very clear that Dr. Sara is concerned equally about teeth function as well as visual appearance.  I was a tough case and my new bridges look absolutely beautiful (they feel good too!).  I am also extremely pleased with my new oral appliance.  It's worlds more comfortable than my old appliance.  

Dr. Sara alone is worth coming to this practice.  Be aware that the level of detail means the appointments tend to run long.  I would rather have a long appointment and have a medical provider get in depth with me rather than a fast-food style in-and-out approach.  Her dental staff are also extraordinarily lovely.  Bridge replacement day was a LONG day and they were so kind and accommodating.  (And there are TVs above to help distract you - yay!)  

There are a couple of areas that could use improvement:  

She has two sides to her practice - the dental side and the TMJ side.  Each side operates as a ""separate"" practice which requires filling out two different medical profiles online.  That was a little annoying but no big deal... except that on both consults, my information was not in the system and one of the assistants had to go through all of it with me again...twice.  

The other issue is that there were promises of phone calls and getting back to me that were never realized.  I had to follow up multiple times to get appointments scheduled and updates on delivery. 

Those issues aside, if you want comprehensive dental care and a killer smile, Dr. Sara and her staff are the best."
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"I saw Justin Beckett speak at the local Ted conference in 2011 so his restaurant has been on my radar for a while.  Finally got the chance to try it last night and I have to say, it's a winner!  

They have a lovely menu of craft cocktails which I'm loving more and more these days.  There's an art to bar-tending but there's a magical art to craft cocktails.

My companion ordered The Farmhand and I ordered The Palmaire.  Both were delicious but The Farmhand was really something special, particularly if you like gin.  

We started with the mac n' cheese.  Definitely get the pancetta on it.  Without it, I daresay it might be underseasoned.  It was delicious!  Definitely not your mom's bowl o' Kraft.  Creamy bechamel sauce and house-made pasta.  

I rarely order pasta when I'm eating out but our waiter assured us that theirs is house-made so I ordered the sausage pasta.  I rarely voluntarily consume sausage but for some reason, this dish kept calling out to me and I'm so glad it did.  The pasta was fantastic and the sausage was outstanding.  I am generally dubious of tube-meat but there was not a tube in sight!  They source their sausage locally and it lacks the round Stepford shape of most sausages (which I admittedly find mildly disturbing).  It came with a rich tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes and whole cloves of roasted garlic.   

My companion ordered the special which was Shepard's pie and he enjoyed it immensely.  

For dessert, he ordered the fig/pecan pie with the ice cream on the side (he is lactose intolerant which is sad for him but happy for me as I often inherit his dairy castaways).  He said the pie was wonderful and I can personally attest to the fact that this ice cream might have been the best ice cream I've ever eaten.  If ice cream and cream cheese had a really shady tryst in an expensive hotel, this would be the love child.  It was ridiculous.  Thankfully, there was only one scoop because I would have kept eating it, warning messages from my stomach be damned.  

I ordered the bacon s'mores which were fantastic.  The bacon is chocolate covered and well done = WIN.  (Recent forays into bacon-dessert have left me disappointed.  Chewy bacon with sweetness is no bueno.)  The marshmallow is clearly home-made and the additions of caramel and peanut butter were yummy.  

The service was great.  The level of service was a little surprising given the casual-ness of the restaurant.  Our water glasses were constantly refilled, silverware quickly replaced, plates immediately taken away - pretty fabulous.  

The menu is gluten-free and vegetarian friendly.  

Great dinner out and I can wait to go back!"
zTK1nPD2Hpa-ksSXsE-JzQ,"Here's a novel idea: Open a comedy club with food that doesn't come from the freezer section of Costco.  Anyone?  Anyone?  Bueller?  

I had high hopes for the ""new and improved"" Tempe Improv.  I love love love stand-up comedy but always found it hard to justify what is bound to be a rather expensive evening.  Unfortunately, the new policies have made it that much harder.  

They automatically add an 18% gratuity to EVERY CHECK.  Had our service not been terrible, I wouldn't have minded this nearly as much.  Our waitress was nice but it took absolutely forever to get anything.  We asked for water when we were seated (which was 45 minutes before the start time of the show) and didn't actually receive water until halfway through the show.  Long before this though, two in our party physically walked up to the bar and brought back waters for the table.  

They've changed the ""two item minimum"" to a ""two drink minimum"" thus making the entire experience even rape-ier.  

The menu looks very much the same as the old menu.  The food quality is, overall, poor.  My husband's quesadilla was TINY.  It looked like a child's plate.  My buffalo chicken salad was mostly lettuce and the chicken had possibly been hot the day before.  It had clearly been around a while.  It wasn't even warm and was tough to cut.  The pretzel appetizer was okay but I am spoiled for pretzels thanks to Claim Jumper and Arrogant Butcher.  These were slightly better than the Super Pretzels you bake at home. 

The drink situation is highway robbery, prison sex and food poisoning all at the same time.  My friend and I ordered standard cosmos.  They arrived and my glass was nowhere near full and it tasted like cherry koolaid.  They were so bad we asked to send them back and get something else.  The waitress accommodated us (which was nice) and the drinks sat on our table.  Upon reviewing the check, she did take off the cosmo but I noticed that it was $11 plus a $2 upgrade for SMIRNOFF.  Smirnoff.  Are you kidding?  She even asked us if we wanted to upgrade vodka and we said no.  Smirnoff being an upgrade still boggles my mind.  What do you get without an upgrade?  Harry's Toilet Vodka?  We all tried each other's drinks and everything was weak and watered down.  

The one thing they've done right is rearrange the club so there is less seating and you are not accidentally creating a child with your neighbor.  Admittedly, it was nice not to be so crammed in.  

Despite these issues, we enjoyed the comic immensely (we saw Michael McDonald).  As I said earlier, I love stand-up but the current practices at the Improv are going to make it very difficult for me to come back."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Bonchon

Arrived for lunch around 12:30 pm, ordered combo of wings and drumsticks in soy garlic sauce along with an order of Bulgogi.

Restaurant was pretty full for a Monday lunch time, took our order right away and then waited and waited for our food. If you are on lunch from work the wait for food will kill your hour lunch and then some. Took 45 minutes to get the chicken, Bulgogi was 55 minutes. Then waited for our bill, total time from sitting down to leaving - 1 hour 25 minutes, for 2 entrees!! I understand that this is a newly opened restaurant, but one of the workers  was working his tail off, while ours was just over whelmed.

Good size variety of dishes and a big size menu.

The garlic soy chicken is very good, wings are good size, drumsticks are very big

The Bulgogi is bland and would not recommend, need some Bulgogi 
marination sauce on the meat. Says it is marinated in a homemade sauce, must of missed marination on this skillet. Even though it came on a metal skillet, I swear it seemed like it was boiled or steamed, probably the worst tasteless Bulgogi I have ever had! Seriously, did not want to eat anymore, made a doggie bag with the remaining rice, took it home and fed it to my dog.

Overall, I really liked the Korean Soy Garlic chicken, stay away from the Bulgogi and they were either under staffed or the help was horrible. Come on 1.5 hours to eat here is unacceptable."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Afternoon Tea at the Phoenician 

You are seated in the lobby area over looking the pools and the city.

Let me start off by saying 5 stars.
Our server Wanda is 5 stars and would highly recommend requesting  her and she will give you the 5 star treatment as she says ""my friend"".

Started off ordering our teas to your taste and each person can order their own and later order or switch to other teas.

It is actually a 3 course meal where you start off with ""Finger Sandwiches"": English Cucumber, Hickory Smoked Salmon,, Classic Egg Salad, Phoenician's Lemon and Thyme Chicken Salad and Crisp Asparagus & Garlic Herb Mousse. My favorite  were the Classic Egg Salad and Phoenician's Lemon & Thyme Chicken Salad.

Next was the ""Fresh Baked Scones"", there are 2 different scones, Buttermilk and Cranberry. Recommend asking for more.

Lastly came the ""Tea Pastries"",  they are bite size, eclair, coffee opera, Scottish shortbread, mango dome, fruit tartar, milk chocolate bavarois, chocolate dipped strawberries  and brandied cherry pomponette. You have to try them all and reorder the ones you prefer.

Would highly recommend over ordering and you can take home what you can not finish, so try everything at least once.

Would highly recommend for a nice formal celebration for women's birthdays or even sweet 16 with moms. 

The food served are small and you would not think it would fill you up but it is actually filling."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Went for lunch on a Saturday from the recommendation from friends that have had their all you can eat for $11.99.

Big selection from appetizers to entrée to Ramen or Udon Noodles to Sushi to desserts.

All orders are small like tapas but you can order as many as you like.

It is good to order in small quantities so you know if it is something you really want or like and then go back and order in ""mass quantity"".

I started with the appetizer and got the tempera shrimp, deep fried scallops and gyoza. All 3 were prepared very well so I reordered in larger quantities. 

Also ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and Teriyaki Salmon. Both were excellent so I asked for another order of each. Keep in mind all orders are small.

I also tried the shrimp tempura sushi which was also very good.

I ordered the seafood Ramen which comes in a very small bowl and was probably one of the least favorite dishes.

The best dish was the teriyaki salmon which had a good consistency while having that crispy edge.

The soda drinks were also endless. 

That people waiting on us were very good however some of the dishes took some time where we could not remember whether we ordered them or not. 

Now keep in mind the restaurant states any uneaten food will be charged on top of your regular buffet bill.

Overall I was impressed with the overall concept and $11.99 lunch price.

I look forward to returning to eat here again.

Arigato!!"
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Kwik's Chinese Bistro

Ordered family style which started off with a little something from the restaurant - Deep Fried Won Ton which you generally see with egg drop soup.
Our order were for appetizers, the Pot Stickers which in an order came with 8 good size jewels. They were good size pan fried nicely with a dipping sauce.
We ordered family style and had the Singapore Noodles, Orange Chicken, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Mongolian Beef and Half Duck. Would recommend the Singapore Noodles, which had shrimp, beef and chicken in a thin Noodle which was very tasty, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, which was probably the best dish as the Shrimp were medium size, shelled and a light crisp sauce applied mixed in a chopped array of vegetables of a stir fried blend. The Orange Chicken was also a nicely prepared dish with a generous serving.

The Mongolian Beef was flavorful but was okay and as for the Duck, once you have had the traditional roast duck, you don't want it prepared any other way and it came pan fried or something other than the traditional way and was more bone than meat.

Overall it seemed as though this restaurant may better serve the Buffet style crowd during lunch time rather than the old traditional Chinese people looking for old style Cantonese food.

I will say again, the Pot Stickers, Singapore Noodles and the Salt and Pepper Shrimp was something I would recommend you try.

Honestly not my first choice for Traditional Chinese Food, but will keep them in mind."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Country style building and decor, at the entrance there is the ticket counter along with a huge bar and an area for snacks which includes popcorn, gelato, sorbet, gourmet desserts, beverages and coffees. 

All seats are recliners with a tray, Reserved seats, not too many seats total in the theatre. Our theatre had 5 rows of maybe 8 to 10 seats per row.

We ordered the Fish and Chips, Deep Dish Pizza called the Predator and the other the Rocky. The Fish and Chips came with about four small strip and average amount of fries. The pizzettes were filled with items but almost reminded me of a frozen totinos pizza. It was not bad but I have have better.

Would suggest purchasing a Groupon or getting the gift card at Costco $79 for $100 worth of food and snacks.

I liked the theatre and the seats that recline, the food was okay with a wide variety, would suggest shrinking down the menu and improving the quality of the food.

I liked the snack bar and the bar that was offered. 

Our service was slow getting the food, but still received the popcorn quickly which almost made us full before we received the meals.

The Groupon has a couple different selections, one with drinks and popcorn and one with just popcorn, the website says they offer endless refills of popcorn with full purchase, not sure if that is with the Groupon purchase. 

Would say the theatre and seats are superior to most dinner theatres, but the food quality is lacking.

Had a good time and will be back only with a Groupon and or the Gift Card from Costco."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Made reservations for birthday dinner for a Friday night. The restaurant was very busy.

First time to this restaurant since it was cork and cleaver. A few changes and updated decor for steak 44 compared to cork and cleaver. I liked the entrance where it had many of the cleaver menus from the previous restaurant hung on the wall.

The first noticeable thing as we sat down at a table was the loud talking from the restaurants where you could barely hear the other person sitting across the table. Almost to the point where it was becoming annoying that the people were so loud.

The fresh bread that started the meal was hot and fresh and delicious. Ordered the bone in ribeye, loaded baked potatoes and asparagus. The ribeye came out sizzling and stay that way for at least 10 minutes into the meal. The baked potato came with two potatoes in the order and was fully loaded like it said it would be. The ribeye was perfectly prepared juicy and tender. One of the better rib eye steaks that I've had in quite some time.

A few very nice touches in detail at the restaurant were that they used crumb blade to clean off the table many times and after the meal brought hot warm towels to clean your hands.

Since we were there celebrating my birthday they comped a dessert which we chose the red velvet bread pudding. This was exceptional and would recommend  this dessert.

Overall I would rank this restaurant in the new hot business category. Highly recommend this restaurant if you have not been there food service atmosphere and overall customer satisfaction is at it's highest."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Zen Culinary 

Let be preface this by saying ""Lo Fon"", some of you will understand. 

Walked in to a confusing entrance that led us walking right in front of a Live Band of 2 playing some pretty good music.

The menu Entrées were Expensive, wow the steaks were around $48.

Large dining area than expected,
Bar area with high tables, Back part has normal height dining tables.

Ordered the appetizer Shumai, Dinner Banh Mi Sandwich, Dinner Yellow Curry with Chicken and Dinner Zen Fried Rice with Chicken.

All entrees were of good portion as we shared among the three of us.

The Shumai arrived in a steamed basket with six in the order, not of quality we are used to from other dim sum places. The skin peel of the Shumai was on the hard side while the meat was not real tasty.

The Zen  Fried Rice was on a large dish and a good portion to share, 
Although it was sparse with items in the rice and the flavor was okay, but not to what we are use to.

The Yellow Curry with Chicken was pretty good, like I prefer, base was on the watery side but good which came in a big round bowl and a bowl size amount of rice, if it was a little bit more thick would have been perfect.

The Banh Mi Sandwich was huge and came with a good portion of perfectly crisp tater tots. Although the sandwich was huge, the bread is not the fresh baked baugette that I would prefer. 

Arrived on a Wednesday around 8:00 pm and there were almost just as many people performing in the band than customers in the restaurant. 

We mainly went because we had a $50 gift card, if we did come back, not sure if it will be there."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Small family owned restaurant in a strip mall tucked away.

Mainly decided to come here because we were looking for a place and in the area with good Yelp reviews.

Not to be racist, all I have to say is beware of white people giving ratings for Asian Food, it is just a different standard.

I would recommend the sandwiches which come on a fresh baguette that doesn't break your teeth when you bite into it. 

We ordered the #18 sandwich - Korean Bulgoki Meat Sandwich and #20 - Spicy Pork Sandwich. I liked the Bulgoki Sandwich which had great flavor but could of used a little bit more meat. Would be nice if you could order double meat like Lee's Sandwiches. The Spicy Pork Sandwich was a bit tangy for me but I am not into spicy dishes.

We also tried the Teriyaki Chicken Bowl and the meat did not resemble chicken, looked more like a processed meat. Don't know if i would recommend the Teriyaki Chicken.

We also ordered some french fries to go along with the sandwiches which was pretty good.

Through some of the reviews people were raving about the Spicy Asian Fusion Ramen so we tried it and when it was placed on the table I started laughing because it looked like the Top Ramen Noodles from the grocery store that you can buy 10 for a $1.  So when we ordered the Spicy Asian Fusion Ramen we asked to tone down the spice,  appearantly they did not add the spice pack that comes with the Noodle package.

If you go, order the sandwiches, the bread is very good , I enjoyed the Bulgoki Sandwich and would recommend.  

Wanted to support small business and especially a family owned restaurant, but you can not serve that type of Ramen Noodle."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Love Lo Lo's and have been dining with them for a long time when they were in their original location before they upgraded the new downtown location and expanded to the 2nd location in Scottsdale. 

Tonight's experience was a little disappointing with the entire experience. First, Do not like the valet parking, the server was kidding but did not care for his sense of humor and most of all the Waffles and syrup was way below par.

The waffles were not as firm as would like, they were under cooked and almost soggy but the most disappointing thing was the obvious watering down of the syrup where there was hardly any syrup taste and no substance where it was the thickness of water.

When I asked the server what type of chicken I could get, he said ""fried"" in a smart a$$ way which pissed me off because I did not want white meat and just wanted to assure that I could get dark meat. Bruce then started to go on how he loved his job which I did not get the impression that he did.

The last item I did not care for was the valet which our car was parked right by the door, the valet asked me if I just wanted to pull it out myself and I said sure, but when I went to get in the other valet car was parked so close there was no way I could even open the door. Was not happy to see the other car parked so close and I tried to check if there were any scratches or dents but it was too dark.

Let me give Lo Lo's some feedback, your new restaurants are beautiful and impressive but your food is not living up to where it used to be, I would rather have the ghetto buildings and great quality food than the Foo Foo new nice buildings and the crap food and service that you have now."

Ramen Restaurant finally in North Scottsdale! 

Unfortunately, did not meet any expectations what so ever.

Ordered the Ramen Goma House Specialty with Onsen Egg and Pork Gyoza.

When I have Ramen, the broth is the first thing that has to impress, the broth was filled with pepper where it was difficult to savor any flavor. Generally the soup broth could almost live by properly prepared Char Sui Pork and Bok Choy. The Char Sui had no taste and there was one small piece of Bok Choy.  All you could taste is a salty broth filled with pepper that makes you cough with every spoon of broth. 

We also had the Pork Gyozas and the taste of the pork was almost ransid. Their were 5 gyozas to the order and the size were average to small.

The ordering as you come in on the IPad is different , innovative and impersonal. As a service business to put an iPad in front to greet you is not the type of people personal touch I expect in a restaurant, in fact who are you tipping for service when at the end of the iPad gives you a choice of what percent tip you want to add? I may just go to the vending machines in Walmart to get dinner.

I really wanted to like this restaurant and hope that finally there is a Ramen Restaurant in North Scottsdale, there is, but it is not for me. 

Bottom line is when your restaurant is based on Ramen, you would think they have a product that is going to back it up. Don't believe the Asians are going to flock to this place, maybe the pretty people will endure for a little bit but my wife said ""This place is not going to last"" which I give it less than a year if changes are not made.

I will travel to Chandler 20 miles away to have Ramen than come here again."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Came here tonight the night before Super Bowl 49 at around 7;30 pm. With Super Bowl Central Downtown I was going to give up on eating downtown but noticed there was not a line to get in which should have been a sign.

Only had to wait 5 minutes and were seated as far from the entrance as possible and I thought this is going to be bad because we were tucked in a corner away from everyone else. We sat there for over 10 minutes  with no one that ever came to our table to even acknowledge us. My wife asked one of the people if there was some one to take our order and a nice person came over to get our drinks. The sad thing was we found out our real waitress walked by us a number of times without even talking to us. Her name was Merideth. The other person who was to setup the beer garden took our order and was the one who got our drinks, when she got our order she told us today was her first day. After we got our food and we were almost done eating Merideth came by to finally acknowledge us and then asked us about our drinks. I told my wife Merideth did not deserve a penny and a the tip should have gone to the other peraon.

As for the food, the menu consists of wings, one burger, pulled pork sandwich and 2 pizzas.

I ordered the burger medium and came out well, the fries were good and the bun was too big for the burger patty. It came with lettuce tomato and onions.

The pulled pork sliders were good and topped with a tasty bbq sauce.

We also had the cheese pizza which the top was half burnt.

The wings were meaty.

Should have not eaten here and the service did not exist.

Will not come back and hope you don't either. Service absolutely  was terrible except the new girl. She gives this place one star."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Small restaurant tucked in the shopping plaza with Walmart. Went in with low expectations and Groupon. Left very surprised and impressed by rhe food and service. 

We both ordered a 2 Meat Dank Plate at $12.49 which comes with one side. One Dank Plate had the Fatty Brisket along with the Sausage and the other had the Smoked Fried Drums and Pulled Pork which both came with a cupcake size cornbread. Our sides were the Pork Belly Pit Beans and the other were the French Fries. 

Would highly recommend the Smoked Fried Drums (Drumsticks) and the Fatty Brisket. The Smoked Fried Drums are excellent with a crisp skin that is smoked which was a good combination of taste and crisp skin, while they asked what kind of brisket we preferred,  lean or fatty and we chose the tender juicy fatty type which was an excellent decision. The Sausage was also good and would recommend as a 1A choice, the pulled pork was the LEAST favorite of the four entrées. I think the pulled pork would have been better with bread as a sandwich rather than by itself.

As for the sides, I really enjoyed the Pork Belly Pit Beans with a solid taste and flavor. The French Fries were a little on the soggy side where I prefer a little bit more on the crispy side.

The Dank Plates come out on a cooking sheet with a kind of lining paper and a fairly nice amount of each item you order.

The restaurant is small which has around 3 tables that can sit 8 people and 3 tables that can sit 4.

The staff were all friendly and helpful with helping you order and making sure you are taken care of.

Enjoyed the total experience and was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant and will be back again.

One reminder tip, if you can get a Groupon for Dankys,  go for it to save some $$"
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"This had been one of my bucket list restaurants to try and it did not disappoint. 

Came here for my wedding anniversary on a Friday night at 6:30 pm and was worried that we would have to wait. I tried to call twice and got the answering machine. We had a half hour drive so we decided to go for it. As we were on our way my wife was able to call them and they said about a half hour wait so I thought let's do it.

As we got there I saw an empty table and were seated right away. Bonus!

Nothing fancy for the decor but a home feeling and nice and casual.

Was brought to our table and quickly had a basket of bread and salsa. The bread was so soft and the salsa was an olive base salsa which was awesome. 

We started with the Fresh Guacamole with Pomegranate Seeds which was prepared on a cart in front of our table. The waiter asked which ingredients we would like to add in and then he mixed the guacamole in front of us. Excellent and fresh! Would highly recommend. 

Wanted to order some of the traditional mexican food such as the street tacos but ended up going with what the waiter recommended and was not sorry for what we ordered on recommendation. 

We shared the Pescado Del Mar and the Filete Mignon Tita. 

The Pescado Del Mar was a filet of Halibut topped with shrimp, scallops and crab, and a shallot of white wine cream sauce finished with longaniza chorizo sausage and Carmelized onion.

The Filete Mignon Tita was prepared as requested and was one of the most tendor filets I have ever had. Also came with a chipotle mash potatoes that was excellent. 

We finished with the Churros Rellenos which were 2 churros with a large scoop of ice cream topped with caramel and candied pecans.

What a great evening of dining and celebrating a special occasion."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"CVS Pharmacy

First of all I want to start by saying how unprofessional and rude tonight's staff with and including the Pharmacist Betty Mah. They are the worst pharmacist group and customer service people that I have ever dealt with.

Pharmacist Betty Mah and her staff should all be replaced, I have been trying to get my prescription for over a week from CVS Caremark with no results, so I requested from my doctor 7 days worth of medication until my prescription arrives. Generally my 90 day prescription cost $0.00 after insurance. The CVS Pharmacy crew told me that CVS Caremark had sent the prescription 3 days ago and then could not give me the 7 day prescription under insurance that my doctor sent to CVS Pharmacy. CVS Pharmacy wanted to charge $21.59 for 7 pills because they said my insurance would not cover the temporary filler prescription, since it was sent 3 days ago. After going home to check online, the order had never been sent and was put on hold as CVS Pharmacy said and then I had CVS Caremark release and send the 90 prescription and approve the insurance on the 7 day prescription which they did right away.

Even when I went back to CVS Pharmacy they still have me a hard time picking up the 7 day prescription for no charge after insurance. The male tech who is Hispanic had such an attitude and wanted to argue with me about why they would not release the 7 day prescription. After he looked up the updated prescription and walks by me giving me this attitude shrugg and makes this groaning frustration sound and I yelled at him and told him to just give me the 7 pills.

What a group of misfits, please transfer your prescription away from this branch as I will not deal with these people again.

Please forward to Corporate CVS Pharmacy to get rid of the unprofessional and rude people."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"We arrived off the plane from Dallas from an early flight back home around lunch time thinking what to eat for lunch. As we walked through terminal four we saw a small billboard sign for Gino's East Pizza.

Straight from the airport to Gino's and we ordered, from our exceptional waitress Regina, a large Meaty Legend Deep Dish Pizza. 45 minutes later, time taken to cook deep dish pizza, we were served our first slice.

We ate at the Gino's East Pizza Restaurant in Chicago off of Michigan Avenue a few years ago and was not a real fan after that experience, so when Gino's East opened in the Arcadia area I was not real excited about the opening.

I have to say this experience at the Arcadia location was impressive, the pizza was very good, hot out of the oven, the meats were excellent, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Canadian Bacon and Bacon along with the Pizza Crust was awesome.

Have to give props to our awesome waitress Regina, she was probably one of the best waitress that I have ever had. She asked us if we were a member of Gino's East Club and we said no, so she encouraged us to join and noted that we would receive instantly $5 off our pizza. We were intending on ordering a small size pizza but with the discount we decided to upsize to a large size. Regina explained all the options very thoroughly and specifically told us the deep dish pizza would take about 45 minutes to cook so she recommended some appetizers to keep our time in the meanwhile and also gave us sharpies to write on the wall. After taking care of us and wrapping up our leftovers, she writes the date on the box and includes a smile also which we would have done later.

Previously I was not a big fan of Gino's East but after this visit I am now. I would give this review of 4 Stars, but Regina our waitress moved it to a definite 5 Stars.

This location has set a high standard!"
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Called in an order on the way from work to home and asked for prices and when I go there one of the pizzas was different. 

Ordered a large deep dish sausage and mushroom was quoted $26 and a medium margherita and was told $9 on the phone. When I got there they rang up the bill and said $47. I said how much were each pizza and was told $26 and  $17 and I said I was told $9 for the medium. 

The 2 females there were pretty rude about the price discussion and I thought whatever.if this pizza does not wow me I will never come back mainly because of their attitude. 

When I got the pizzas I lifted them and they must of weighed over 5 lbs. The deep dish is a monster of a pizza definitely weighing in over 5 lbs.

When I tried the deep dish sausage and mushroom it is prepared by putting the ingredients on first then the cheese and topped with the sauce covering everything. It makes the pizza very saucy. The pizza had little bits of sausage and a good amount of mushrooms. My opinion it was a little skimpy on the sausage which you could hardly taste any sausage. 

My daughter really liked the thin crust margherita pizza and thought it was very good. 

Some of the other reviews claimed this was the best deep dish in AZ and rivaled any Chicago Deep Dish Pizza was in my opinion very wrong. 

First of all it is in my opinion not even the best in AZ let alone even be compared to any Chicago Deep Dish. My favorite deep dish pizza is Rosatis on Shea and Scottsdale Road (The other Rosatis are not as good). Thus pizza does not even compare to the Chicago Pizza of Lou Malnati's or Giordanos.

If you like quantity over quality and over priced thin crust pizza this is for you.

I think starting off with the price in question was a horrible first impression and the 2 females were terrible to deal with.

Overall was not impressed by the deep dish and will not come back because of the customer service. 

Rosatis here I come."

Made reservations through Open Table for the Friday before Mother's Day at 8:00 pm. Unbelievable how busy it was as we walked in.

Waited at the entry for about 10 minutes as we waited by the V Lounge with great live music.

The atmosphere is very nice with low lighting to add to your experience. 

We started off with the Point Judith Calamari which was prepared in a Kung Pao Style with Roasted Cashews and Crisp Noodles. We had the sauce on the side to ensure we did not get our mouth flamed out. Portion was pretty good to share and not too hot.

We ordered the Chilean Seabass which was steamed in a Hong Kong Style Light Soy Broth which was so tender that it just melted in your mouth. This was a nice choice and would recommend.

We also ordered the 34 oz Porterhouse Steak that we shared, that was a monster of a steak and my son and I could not finish. This dish was also a winner being so tender and prepared as requested. 

The last entree was the Bay of Fundy Salmon which was sautéed with Young Vegetables and Maille Mustard Vinaigrette which was also a wonderful dish.

We shared 2 sides, the Broccolini with Lemon and Garlic and the Parmesan and Chive French Fries which were both okay, would prefer to order others next time.

For dessert we had their signature dessert which was the Hot Bananas Foster Butter Cake which was a show and a delite by itself. Our waiter, Brenon, lit the container and then poured the flaming sauce over the butter cake. I have to say if both of my kids are video taping the flaming dessert they were impressed by the presentation. The taste did not disappoint, if you eat here you have to order this dessert. One of the best desserts we have ever had.

Have to say the service was excellent and our waiter Brenon was on top of everything with his recommendations and taking care of us.

What a great experience and meal, would highly recommend and definitely would come back again."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Maple and Ash

Very dark inside and loud blaring music and with people talking it makes it difficult for you to have a conversation with your own table. This restaurant is definitely for a younger crowd with the decibel level.

We came here tonight to celebrate my wife's birthday and sitting across the table was difficult just to have a nice dinner and conversation. It required leaning to the middle of the table and yelling to barely hear each other.

Fire Roasted Seafood Tower, we ordered the ""Pro"" size which gives you a little bit more of each items that included half maine lobster tail, scallops, wild blue prawns, oysters, 
manila clams, wild alaskan crab legs. This is all topped in a garlic butter sauce. Scallops, shrimp, lobster and crab legs were excellent, the clams and oysters were okay.

28 day Dry Aged Bone In Ribeye which is 22 oz comes sliced we ordered ours a medium rare which is cooked over wood fire of maple and ash. The meat is very tender and tasty, was a good choice.

Yukon Gold Gratin was like a scallop style potato dish with a crust of cheese on top. Would skip.

Food is excellent, service was top notch, the ambiance is much too loud, to hipster to be scene atmosphere.

Would suggest a separate area that has just a more quiet relaxful setting for people that want to have a nice serene dinner instead of leaning into the table yelling at each other for conversation and having a thumping sub woofer blaring in your ear all night. Leaving the restaurant was similar to coming out of a loud concert and having your ears adjust for a couple minutes.

I rate the steak and seafood tower as a 4.5, the ambiance loud blaring sound as a 1, that is why I will rate this restaurant a 3.

Separate the sound level and I will re-rate, come back and recommend this restaurant, if not you can have your 30 and below crowd who generally are not repeat customers and generally don't appreciate good food but want to be at the hip places and move on."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Drive from Scottsdale to this location to see Southpaw because of the limited availability and got there 10 minutes before the showing only to find out that our 16 and 19 year old children were not allowed into the theater because it is for 21 or older. 

My wife and I did not understand and thought at first that either the movie content was too harsh or sexually explicit or possibly the theater serves alcohol and turns into a bar or something. 

Only to find out after sometime that this is exclusively for 21 and older as designated for adults by the theater.  Had we know earlier we would not have made the drive there and wasted our time. Like a 16 and 19 year old are going to be a distraction like infants in a Disney animation movie. 

Come on what a crock of crap!!

We decided that instead of not being allowed in to see Southpaw that we would see Mission Impossible and asked for student discounts only to be asked by the ticket person to show student ID which the 16 year old did not carry with them because the high school requires them to use a lanyard to display at all times and they only carry around at school. The person taking the tickets was stand pat at needing the student ID which I replied ""give us a break you already screwed us over by not allowing us to see Southpaw and now you want to pull this?""

Besides the worst customer service I have ever experienced the food for all us was horrible.  The coconut shrimp was tasteless and terrible and the mushroom burger had a strange smell.

The ticket person should be fired or taught some customer service because if you piss off all the customers you will eventually have no customers. 

I would give this place a zero stars or negative if I could, but the one star is for the waitress that served us.

Btw the ticket person seated us on the end of the first row to see an action movie when the entire second row was empty.

I never make this statement, but this place sucks and will strongly encourage you not to go here.

I will never be back!!"
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Urban Wag Pet Spa Arizona

First found Urban Wag Pet Spa on Facebook and decided our dog was pass due to have a professional groomer get our dog back on track and look his best.

Had our 8 year old Shih Tzu Yorkie Buster groomed by owner Heather for the first time on 12/07/18. Our dog Buster is generally not very social and when I brought Buster over to Heather's house and there were 3 dogs, I did not know how he would react, but instantly he felt right at home with the 3 dogs and Heather.

As a first time customer, we spent about 20 minutes communicating what I was looking for. Buster had previously been groomed by a grooming school but it has been quite some time since he has had a professional.

Buster needed his under coat shaved with his hair being matted especially around his rear and genital. I generally have his rear shaved to reduce poop from getting stuck on his butt area. Also needed his nails trimmed and just have all his coat shortened and shape his face.

Heather assured that she would take care of everything and would need about an hour and a half to two hours and call when she was done.

After about an hour and a half I received a call that Buster was ready, as I came to pick him up, I could barely recognize Buster as he looked incredible and better than I could ever imagine. Heather also explained to me that she took care of everything that I had asked and also trimmed the hair inside his ears and that he may be shaking his head for a little bit to get the remaining hair out. She also said his nails were very long and that his under coat that was matted was all taken care of. Buster's coat length was perfect, last year the grooming school accidentally shaved his coat all the way down to his body and I about freaked out but thought it would eventually grow out.

To top off everything, Heather put a red plaid bandana on him.

Urban Wags price is very competitive to the market, but Heather goes above and beyond with very nice details.

Would highly recommend Urban Wag and Heather to take care of your pet and give them the royal treatment."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Small restaurant with no more than 10 tables and family owned.

Everything is numbered so you can just say which number you want.

We ordered the #10 sizzling rice soup, #23 Thai Green Curry, but requested it to not have any heat at all, the cashier thought he was funny and said what you want it hot, #28 - Totties Pan Fried Noodles and #36 - Totties Fried Rice. 

The Sizzling Rice Soup was pretty good and would probably order again. The soup included shrimp, chicken, baby bok choy, cabbage and mushrooms with puffed rice to add in add the sizzle.

The Thai Green Curry was good except the base was at a medium heat rather than the no heat as requested, almost from the cashiers remarks when we ordered was liked he purposely made the curry spicy.  It was almost not tolerable by my family of the medium heat. Very disappointed. 

We ordered the Totties Fried Rice and Totties Pan Fried Noodles which I expected by having their name on dishes to be their signature entrées.

The Totties Fried Rice was pretty good with a combination of chicken, beef and shrimp. 

The Totties Pan Fried Noodles when came out, the noodles were too hard and the brown sauce was separate from the noodles, beef, chicken and shrimp. It was actually better the next day when the noodles soaked up the sauce and blended with all the other items.

I so wanted this place to have excellent food but the dishes we had, 2 of 4, were disappointing. 

I believe it was one of the owners/chef, could have been Tottie, that came out to talk with us and I asked her about the curry when she told the heat was at medium, I told her it was too hot and she said the leftovers would be diluted to a more mild temperature which she did when I tried it the next day.

I would go back to try other dishes, the gentleman at the counter by his actions and the way he treated us, almost by himself made us not want to come back. His inability to have the curry turned low and when we try a new restaurant we order a few items and he scoffed at us and said we ordered too much. 

I hate to rate this now but our first time there was not impressive."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Been here a few times and each experience was top notch.

I am not into franchise restaurants but this is first class and does not give the stuffy atmosphere some other upper steak restaurants have.

I don't think my drink ever got below 3/4 before it was topped off.

As for the food, we shared the 22 oz Bone in Ribeye and the Salmon. Sides are extra but we had the mashed potatoes and asparagus. The mashed potatoes are almost creamy which I believe they mix sour cream and lots of butter for a pretty good taste. The asparagus is grilled which gives it almost a crisp snap taste.

We ordered the Bone in Ribeye medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I was indecisive between the Porterhouse and the Ribeye and Shelby our waitress recommended the Ribeye because of the fat that would add flavor. Great recommendation! The Salmon was prepared perfectly also.

We have come here to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries and each time has been a great experience. 

Last night we came to celebrate my son's 20th Birthday and Shelby brought out a complimentary dessert comprised of cheesecake and a chocolate cake. The cheesecake was exceptional! 

Shelby was our waitress was top notch and so exceptional, she made our dining experience a very memorable one.

Looking forward to our next celebration here.

So my wife and I decided to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary here and made a reservation through Open Table, when we arrived, we were seated at a table that was topped with graffiti shaped liked hearts and rose petals and an anniversary card from Capital Grille with a nice note. Our server Jen was top notch and we had the 22 oz bone in Ribeye and 14 oz Dry Aged NY Strip Steak along with asparagus and the au gratin potatoes. Everything was prepared as requested and then Jen presented us with a combo dessert that in the middle said Happy Anniversary with a Creme brulee cheesecake and a coffee mousse cake..
So we were asked by the manager if everything was good and the next day had a follow up phone call asking if our meal and experience was good. Solid 5 stars and love this place!"
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Roland's Market

My parents knew the original owners when this was a market / small family business.

The hype of the combination of Pizzeria Bianco and Tacos Chiwa has set high expectations. I would say the restaurant satisfied the majority of them.

The bread and quesidilla definitely had the influence of Pizzeria Bianco while most of the other dishes have a mexican flare of Tacos Chiwa.

We dined on a Friday evening with a group of six, the restaurant was busy, strange parking lot where it almost encourages double parking. We found a parking spot on the street just in front of the restaurant.

Started off with the French Fries, Elote En Vaso and the
Veggie Quesidilla. The fries were crisp and good, I liked the Elote en Vaso, I am a big fan of mayo with corn, actually grew up with Miracle Whip on corn on the cob so this was a winner. The veggie quesidilla was very good, toppings included mozzarella, jalapenos, mushrooms, white onions and spinach. Was very good, next time would like to try the chorizo quesidilla.

Ordered the Chili Colorado Burrito, was told it was on the spicy side, but just enough spice and definitely not to hot. Came sliced in two with a noodle soup with it. Combination of niman pork, colorado chili and refried beans. The flour tortilla was amazingly cooked crisp and all the combination was very good.

Steak Sandwich was in a bread from pizzeria bianco, very good baugette. Included niman ranch steak, guacamole, lettuce, beans and salsa de arbol. Yum

Tres Leches is a milk cake with a combination of three milks, condensed milk, whole milk and evaporated milk. It is very creamy light and well done.

Menu is very limited, which is not a bad thing, good suggestions from our waiter. When I go to a restaurant that I have never been before, I look over the menu, kind of decide what I want, but ask the server what their favorite dishes are just to get an idea.

Building is an old Asian owned grocery store renovated into a hip open concept restaurant with a bar, show casing the original structure and theme from it's past.

Will definitely come back and maybe try breakfast or lunch."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"There has been so much Hype for this place I was hoping it would not be a let down. 

I read all the reviews and the long lines and how the restaurant will run out of certain popular items so I decided to arrive at 10:15 am and wait until the restaurant opens at 11:00 am. As I got to the restaurant parking lot which is very small there is a person directing traffic later to find out he is the father of Scott the owner of LMB. Arriving at LMB at 10:15 am there were 10 people already in line. I got a parking space and got in line to wait. 

Many of the people in line were repeat customers and had great tips on what and what not to order. But there was one common thing to order - Brisket. 

So my order was for take out which later I found out and find this as a great tip to share, if you order 5 lbs of meat you can call in ahead 2 or 3 days and you don't have to wait in line. HELLO!!

I ordered 2 lbs of Fatty Brisket,  1 lb of Pork Ribs, 1 lb of Pulled Pork and 1 lb of Beef Ribs. The beef rib was massive so it was only one rib which I asked for the center cut rib. I also ordered the sausage,  jalapeño cheese grits, beans and Pecan Pie.

I truly have to say this is the best BBQ I have ever had. The brisket was tender and juicy and Scott let everyone sample. It is truly a prize it itself eating the brisket. Best Brisket ever, don't know how to convey how good it is. The pork ribs meat just falls off the bone, the sausage is home made from the brisket need I say more. The beef rib is good but compared to the brisket and Pork Ribs it is okay. The beef ribs were available for the day I was there. 

The sausage is very good along with the Pecan pie. 

The jalapeño cheese grits were good but I could pass on the beans and maybe the pulled pork.

Scott the owner is carving everything you order and very people friendly with his conversation.  

It is a small place where Scott carves the meat another person takes your order with the sides and then there is a cashier. The counter is about 15 feet long.

Little Miss BBQ is now my standard for BBQ leaving Phil's BBQ in San Diego,  Lucille's BBQ and Rudy's BBQ in the dust.

If you don't try Little Miss BBQ you are only settling for second best."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Mowry and Cotton with an interesting name and history behind the name of the restaurant.

Chef Tandy Peterson has assembled quite an awesome menu.

Our waiter Myron was very good and offered a indept explanation and recommendation of favorite dishes.

Lily the hostess almost ruined the entire evening. Of course I understand that a large portion of the seating is outside in the patio by the pool and what happens on Valentine's Dinner, it rains. So Lilly sits us at a table in the bar, I ask her if there are other options not in the bar, her reply is you can sit outside (in the rain and cold) or at the bar counter. So table in the bar it is. The table was by the entrance and hostess podium, so we see everyone who comes in and the next 8 couples get seated in the dining area within an hour. I almost blew my top, luckily my wife calmed me down or I would have confronted Lily the hostess. I was so pissed off!! Fortunately the food and Myron were incredible or I would have questioned Lily why everyone else was being seated in the dining room and we were not given that option. I made the reservations through Open Table about a month and a half ago for a special Valentine's Dinner with my wife.

Ordered the Cowboy Ribeye, the Grilled Black Cod, Crispy Potatoes and Apple Crumble

Cowboy Ribeye is prepared in smoked blue cheese, onions, pepita and chimicura. Cooked as requested medium rare. Looked like it Tomahawk Ribeye cut and very tender and delicious. 

The Grilled Black Cod is prepared with parsnip, spinach, wildflower honey, cashews and finger lime. Very very tender and soft fish, just melts in your mouth and an awesome sauce to choose if you want to dip it in it.  Very impressive

Crispy Potatoes with Chorizo, Horesradish, Tomato Brava Hot Sauce. Potatoes are very crispy exactly as advertised and the way I like potatoes. The mixture is just plain awesome.

To top it off, we ordered the Apple Crumble which is served with ice cream. The Apple Crumble is served with apple, caramel and molasses. The incredible part is the ice cream. When served, it looks like an apple, with the Apple Crumble, but it is ice cream shaped and painted to look like a peach and the stem is made of chocolate. WOW!

Towards the end of the dinner, we see Michael Bidwell, owner of the AZ Cardinals leaving from the dining room. So if the owner of the AZ Cardinals is having his Valentine's Dinner here then we must have made a good choice.

Besides Lily the hostess, this is an incredible restaurant based on the food and service.

I will give this truly a 4.5 Stars with the half deduction of the hostess, but overall a 5 star."
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"With out a doubt one of the most spectacular meals that you will ever have. Came here to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday and we both ordered the 5 course meal, but chose different items so it turned out to be a 10 course extravaganza. 

Started off with the Cold Appetizer - Duck Cinnamon Breast and Shaved Tuna which was presented very well and great combination of vegtables and spices.

The Hot Appetizers - Black Truffle & Sweet Corn Risotto and Glazed Lobster Mushrooms were awesome. The Risotto was like a corn chowder and the mixture of the Shaved Burgundy Truffles, Shrimp, Chanterelle Mushrooms & Summer Squash made this one of the premier items in the meal

Fish Entree - Hamachi Au Poivre and Wild Mushroom Dusted Monkfish were both new to us but were delish! The Monkfish was complimented with Maitake Mushrooms, grits, rapini and Harissa while the Hamachi had Baby Bok Choy, Oyster Mushrooms Black Beans and an interesting slice fried avocado.

Meat Entree - Red Wine Poached Filet Mignon and Foie Gras Stuffed Quail were presented and prepared spectacular. The Filet was complimented  sweet potatoes, matsutake mushrooms and eggplant

The biggest surprise was the number of Amuse Bouche that was served throughout the meal, where there was always something on the table to eat for a solid 2 and a half hours.
The Amuse Bouche items were Butter Nut Squash Soup, Sloppy Joe sandwich the size of a nickel, House Waffle Chip, Caper, Home made Breads - Sour Dough Fruit and Pickled, Cherry Shooter, Hibiscus Tea,  Pineapple Cocktail Shooter Lava Lamp and Homemade Donuts. The Cherry Shooter was amazing that when placing it in the mouth the cherry just dissolved into liquid form, the Hibiscus Tea came out in a apuratus that looked like a chemistry lab with a seperate burner and as the water was heated it rose to the herbs in a seperate container and mixed the liquid to form the tea. The most entertaining one was certainly the Pineapple Cocktail Lava lamp where the Pineapple Cocktail is in a shot glass size glass placed on top of a lighted coaster.

Service was incredible how the drinks were always filled, the proper silverware was changed to go with your next entree and the explanations of each dish explained.

Located in Cave Creek, so if you even live in North Scottsdale, it is a good drive to the restaurant. 

Without a doubt a memorable meal and would recommend to anyone who would appreciate the fine dining. Unless you have unlimited $, not a place the average person could afford to visit weekly. Is a great place for very special occasions to remember. The 5 course meal depending which one you get is $91 per person without drinks.

Will certainly go here again, just need to save some money for the next visit."

We ordered the following meats - Bulgogi, (Thinly sliced BBQ Beef Marinated in a House Special Sauce), Chadol Baegi (Non Marinated thin sliced Beef Brisket) and Sam Gyup Sai (Sliced Pork Bellies Marinated in Special Wine Sauce). All meats came out uncooked for us to do, on a plate well decorated and impressive presentation with a generous amount of meat on each plate. 

With the different dipping sauces,  the Bulgogi did not need to add any sauces as the marinate provided all the flavors you would need in a great flavor.

The Chadol Baegi came non marinated and I enjoyed using the sauce that resembled a ketchup/salsa style flavor.

The Sam Gyup Sai meat was marinated in a special wine sauce which was good by itself. 

Being the first time here we ordered a conservative selection of meats that were less expensive,  going back I would like to try the Galbi Short Ribs, Ribeye Steak or Lamb Bulgogi. 

I liked how the meats came out with onions, mushrooms and you could add garlic cloves.

My family totally enjoyed our experience and my daughter asked of we could celebrate her birthday here with our immediate side of 22. Which is a total compliment to the restaurant. 

We arrived for a late dinner at 8:45 pm on Black Friday and there were a total of 4 different tables which 3 were occupied by Asians which I find is an excellent example that it is pretty good and authentic. 

In talking to the waitress who was very good, I asked her about the Wednesday special that was on a white board at the entry and she said it was every Wednesday, All You Can Eat, All Meats for $25 per person which includes 2 different sushi selections also. We will definitely come back to try it.

I was amazed that the restaurant opens till 2:30 am, but the location is not a very good visible area and from the outside the lights are so dim that it is questionable whether it is open.

Just be prepared to wait a little if you are ordering to cook at your table because it takes time to prepare the meat plates that you order which are presented very nice.

We came back for the Wednesday all you can eat and waited for 25 minutes to be seated. When ordering, the amount of meat that comes out is different than ordering Ala Carte. They don't give you the fancy well decorated plate, it is just placed on a plate and brought out, don't understand why they were so backed up. Would recommend as soon as you place your order on the burner to place another order because of the time it takes to bring out the order. Would recommend the Galbi with bones, bulgobi, ribeye and Shrimp. The sushi was the biggest surprise with a good variety of different sushi, beware the orders are huge which I expected to be a few pieces. 

Will definitely be back and look forward to the all you can eat on Wednesday!"
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Without a doubt one of the top five memorable meals that I have had and probably top 3 in Arizona. 

Driving up to the location which is across the street from the former Pinnacle Peak Patio location which provides spectacular views of the city. 

We decided to dine here to celebrate my wife's birthday and what a good choice it was. 

Made reservations on Open Table and was called back the day before to confirm reservations, so I  asked the person what they would recommend as far as a sunset dinner with a 600pm reservation and the sunset at 615pm. She asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside and I asked her to recommend since this was our first time. She was leaning toward the patio and assured me she would take care of us.

As we walked up to Sassi the circular driveway was spectacular and the walkway leading to the front entry was even more breathtaking. As you walk in there is a separate building that a wedding reception was taking place which I heard can accommodate up to 150 people. As you walk past that you finally come to the front doors which are spectacular and you know your dining experience is to begin.

We were greeted at the front and taken to our table which was through a long hallway and outside to the patio. We were seated in which I considered the best spot on the patio on the corner overlooking Pinnacle Peak Mountain. So yes we were taken care of.

Our waiter Tony was excellent as he explained the many options of eating family style and then ordering the 2nd Main Course individually. We always had Tiny there or someone else to fill out glasses and make sure we were taken care of.

We started out with the Organic Radishes while we decided what we wanted to order, then ordered to share the Brushetta  (Tomato, Prochetta and Bean), Potatoes, Ricotta Gnocchi, Orcchiettta with Sassi Sausage, Wood Grilled Octopus and then they brought out their fresh baked goods in a basket.

My favorite was the Orcchiettta with home made Sassi Sausage, known as pig ear pasta, but the sausage was one of the best I have had and I am a huge fan of sausage. The Wood Grilled Octopus was good but was so hyped up that I preferred the Orcchiettta with Sausage a little more.

For our 2nd entrée we ordered the New York Strip, Wood Grilled Veal Chops and Wood Oven Roasted Quail. We all shared with each other and all the entrées were excellent and we'll prepared, and the presentation was impressive. 

The New York Strip was a generous portion and cooked perfectly while the Wood Oven Roasted Quail was excellent and tender. The Wood Grilled Veal Chops were soft and tender and along with the mushroom sauce was incredible. 

We finished our meal with the canolis that were a chocolate chip and 2 other flavors. Good tasting but not the best I have had.

The building is impressive as there are many different rooms or open dining area along with the expansive patio area.

Loved everything about the restaurant and the attention to detail that is put into the restaurant. 

A special touch was how the management came around to ask us if everything was okay multiple times by different people. 

Absolutely a memorable dining experience and a great way to celebrate a special occasion. 

Would like to come back, just need to win the lottery to pay for the next meal :)

Spectacular is a one word to describe Sassi"
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Breath taking scenic views, recommend a sunset dinner and eating outside weather permitting. Inside the views are panoramic of the city / mountains and still spectacular. 

Starred out with the Fiery Calamari and Truffle Mac n' Cheese for our appetizers. 

The Fiery Calamari was prepared excellent with a nice crisp batter but not to hard or soggy. It was flavored with a Thai Basil, Peppercorn and Miso Scallion Vinaigrette. A little kick but not to spicy. 

The Truffle Mac n' Cheese was in a mascarpone Italian cheese made from cream with cavatelli pasta shells and beech mushrooms. Very tasty but almost ordered the soft shell crab steamed bun.

Our Main Entrée were the Bacon Wrapped Filet of Beef, Hoisin Braised Short Ribs , Kurobuta Pork Chop and the Miso Glazed Salmon.

The Bacon Wrapped Filet was prepared in a Balsamic Onion, Trumpet Mushrooms along with Blue Cheese Whipped Potatoes and wrapped in bacon. Very tender and flavorful. Awesome for the meat lover.

The Hoisen Braised Short Ribs came with Japenese Yams, Spinach and Shitake Mushrooms topped with Lotus Root. The 
Meat on the ribs fell off the bone and was so tender and flavorful, I personally love the flavor of Hoisin. 

The Kurobuta Pork Chop was a huge serving as it was actually 2 cuts of Pork Chops with double bones. The Pork chops were accompied with Brussel Sprouts and Bacon with an incredible 5 spice honey drizzle. I could have used an extra cup of the 5 spice honey drizzle just to dip eat slice of Pork chop. Gary our waiter told us that the Kurobuta Pork Chop is the Kobe Beef of Pork Chop. Another excellent dish.

The last entrée that we ordered was the Miso Glazed Salmon served with Soba Noodles, Ginger, Bok Choy and Shitake Mushrooms. All the flavors were excellent, moist and tender.

I loved the Asian flare that all the dishes had with many of my favorite flavors and many new asian sauces.

We ended our meal with the Salted Caramel Cheesecake which was a work of art by itself. The cheesecake had a black sesame tuile on top, with huckleberry coulis and topped with smoked bacon ice cream with a circular frozen sugar accent. 

Be prepared, all parking is valet, not unless you want to take a nice little hike up the hill.

Gary was our waiter and was excellent, he met all our needs and more for dinner. Gary also presented us with 2 - Coconut Lime Cupcakes, one for our anniversay and the other for my birthday, they were like heaven.

Besides the exceptional complete meal was my highlight of the evening as Gary setup our family to meet Chef Beau Macmillan,  Chef McMillen came to our table and spoke to us and thanked us for celebrating our anniversary and birthday at his restaurant, I asked him about his chefs table dinner and he gave us his business card if we were interested in his personal chefs table meal and at the end of our meal invited our family into his kitchen where we were able to take a photo with him.

All I can say is the experience was incredible from the atmosphere, service, exceptional view to one of the best meals I have ever had to the gracious hospitality of Chef Beau Macmillan. 

Can't wait to come back to try the Chef's Table.

This was one of the most, if not the most memorable meal I have ever had and if you don't go you are missing out on one of the premier restaurants in Arizona. 

Thanks Chef Beau Macmillan for an exceptional meal and experience! 

Definitely 5 Plus Stars!"
SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA,"Cafe Monarch

Heard nothing but excellent things about Cafe Monarch and it definitely lived up to the high standards that it was hyped up to be. This was definitely a top 5 restaurant in Phoenix Scottsdale area that I have been to.

Billed as a top 100 Best Restaurant in America, 100 Most Romantic Restaurants in America, TripAdvisor & Open Table Top restaurants in America, Phoenix Magazine Best Special Occasion Restaurant, Phoenix New Times Best Restaurant and many others, many years running. There is a reason for all the accolades and certainly every aspect of the dining experience was well represented.

The restaurant does a four course prix fixe menu with the fourth course determing the price. There are gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options upon request.

For the First Course there were 2 selections and we tried both, Roasted Cauliflower Soup that consisted of White Truffle Oil, Pine Nuts, Herb Butter Crostini topped with a signature M which was very rich and tasty. The other selection was a a Seared Salmon Crudo with Scotch Ginger Mignonette, Avocado Salad, Cucumber, Breakfast Radish, Tomato Jam, Micro Cilantro, Plantain Chip, Yuzu Butter which also was delicious. Personally, I prefer the Roasted Cauliflower Soup which is one of their signature dishes.

Going on to the Second Course there was also 2 selections, we all chose the Tempura King Tiger Prawn which was huge and prepared  in a Spiced Papaya Salad, Peppadew Pepper Aioli, Yellow Tomato Jam, Citrus Vinaigrette. The Tiger Prawn was a good size and so tasty, glad I ordered this selection.

The Third Course had 3 selections which we choose the Seared Maine Diver Scallops which was monstorous, I have not had such a large scallop since in Hong Kong and they were on the shell. It was prepared with a Yukon Potato Wasabi Puree, Pear Tare Sauce, Avocado Mousse, Sesame Seed Seaweed Salad with Crispy Shallot Rings. So good, almost hate to share . The other selection that we chose was the Orecchiette Bolognese, my son could not pronounce it properly and Sam our waiter quickly and kiddingly said ""what did you call me, don't call me that again"" which really broke the ice and Sam was just spectacular.

On to the Fourth Course, we all had different items, Cast Iron Seared Filet Mignon ($95), Lamb Rack ($115), Risotto ai Frutti di Mare ($95). Each were excellent and stood out in it's own way.

The Cast Iron Seared Filet Mignon was in a smoked sweet potato puree, charred broccoli, cipollini onion, golden chanterelle mushrooms, cabernet sauvigon beef jus along with crispy elephant garlic chips. Have to say the USDA Prime Beef was about the best and most tender beef I have ever had.

The Rack of Lamb is an organic new zealand lamb, black pepper polenta, arugula salad, bruleed figs and crows dairy feta. Good amount of lamb and a very tender flavorful taste.

The last entree that we had was recommended by Sam our waiter, the Risotto ai Frutti di Mare which consisted of seared diver scallops, king crab, tiger prawn, poached maine lobster, cured cherry tomatoes, pecan arugula pesto, crispy potatoes, shaved pecorino and lobster fumet. What an amazing dish and if you are a seafood lover this is it.

After 2.5 hours of eating, our meal was topped off with a complimentary birthday dessert of Chocolate Flourless Cake which had seasonal berries, cherries, raspberry coulis, black cherry gelato and caramel pearls

Sam our waiter was exceptional with unbelievable knowledge of the food, preparation and pairing. He had great suggestions and made our experience a very fun and memorable time to celebrate my wife's birthday. What a special way to enjoy our celebration. To top it off, when they brought out the complimentary dessert it was accompanied with a gift and sparkler where it ended up being a small jewelry box. Very nice touch.

Parking is horrible, street parking or valet on a Wednesday. Valet your car

Highly recommend a wonderful celebration at this incredible restaurant."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"They are great at talking now to you face to face and setting things up for delivery if it's in stock, however if they have to order an item, worst follow up, worst customer service, they just don't care.

All the sales people work on commission so once the sale is done they no longer care about you, it's not their problem.


We bought 4 items, a desk, a dresser, a serving hutch and a chair.  The chair was the only item that had to be ordered because they did not have it in the store.  I was told it would be in on Tuesday and they would call...NO CALLS.

I called and talked to a guy who answered and said my salesman would be arriving to work in about 30 minutes and they would have him follow up and call me....NO call.

I then called a on Wednesday and talked to the store manager who said he would check with the warehouse and get back to me and yes that is correct, NO CALL.

Now almost two weeks from the day I orders this chair I call and the salesman was really nice and clearly said, we are busy and we work on commission so if I stop to look into this its taking my time away from a sale.

I did explain that I understand that none of this was his fault as he had nothing to do with this from the start through today when he picked up the phone so to not take anything I say personally as it is not directed towards him, I just needed to know if the chair is there or If I need to come in get
My money back and go somewhere else to buy the chair.  I told him I talked to the manager and everything I had dealt with and he said let me see what's going on.  I gave him the invoice number he looked it up and said it shows two in the warehouse, that my salesman was with a customer right now but he will have him call me back.  We will see.  As of now though, it's hard to recommend this store as a place to go because it's all commission driven and you are nothing more then the next sale and forgotten.  

Even the store managers could care less about you once the sale is done.  They run things like a timeshare sale.  When you buy a manger comes over to say thank you and them they kick you to the curb....next..."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"This place never seems to disappoint in the area of food.  The management and leadership can still use a little work.  The open at 11:00am and first the girl  had a hard time unlocking the door and keeping it unlocked.  Once she got past that everyone was let in and from the first person on, you were told it was a 5 minute wait to be seated, REALLY???  There was no one seated yet, what was the 5 minute wait for?  

We requested to be seated outside but when our name was called the person taking us to our table took us to a table inside.  We told her we asked for an outside table and were taken back to the front and told to wait while her and the host figured it out.  In the meantime, other people were seated both inside and out.

Finally we were taken to our table outside.  There was no one else sitting on that side yet so there was a wait for the server to be notified that people were starting to be seated in his area.  

From this point on, everything was awesome.  I had the 5oz filet with sweet potatoes and asparagus was cooked more towards medium rare then medium which is not unusual for this kitchen but none the less it was good.

We also had a salad which was amazing.  At the end we ordered cappuccinos and some desert.  When mine came, I noticed it had cinnamon sprinkled on top.   I called the waiter over and asked if it was cinnamon and he said yes with a surprised look that I was even asking.  I looked at him and asked, Don't you remember I told you I was allergic to cinnamon and we had an entire conversation about this and the sweet potatoes?  He thought for a second and said, oh yes we did talk about that and this was his mistake and he was sorry and would get me another one.  

So even though the food is really good, from the hostess not listening to where people would like to be seated (inside or out), to the kitchen not really preparing food properly as ordered to the server not really paying attention to his customer and the customer needs is the reason for the 3 stars and the statement at the beginning of this about the management needing a little more work and leadership experience."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"This place is new and a MUST TRY PLACE.  It has only been open for about 4 months, but the French style cooking takes it over the top.  Not only that, I would say the Chef here, Ash is probably one of the best in Las Vegas......

Everything is made fresh to order and the matzo ball soup, very close to being better then my moms (hope she is not on Yelp).  Don""t let the name fool you, Cafe, it is not fast food.  

Loving tender care is really put into every dish here.  We have been here twice and on the second visit, the Chef came out and talked to us.  The quality of the food is TOP quality otherwise it is not used here.  Deserts are made in house daily.  And of all the places I have ever been in, and there has been many that I have gotten to know the owners, or the chef would come out and chat a little, but this place is the ONLY place the Chef has ever said, ""I am willing to take any customer who wants to see my clean my kitchen is, anytime"".  Really????  Obviously this place is run by people who care about the customers and the food.

On my first visit i had the Steak Tower and it was really good.  The second time, I had the wings which were just ok...they were good tasting but in my opinion very small.  The soup as I said was awesome, served in a small pot right off the stope.

I also had the falafel plate and it was really good.  My wife had Coq au vin which was on the special""s and it was very good.  This last time she had the Tomato Basil soup which was excellent, my daughter had the Lobster Bisque soup which was some of the freshest and I have ever seen.  It was very rich in the French tradition.  My wife has the grilled chicken which is grilled from fresh, so expect to wait, but it is worth waiting for with a mesquite taste that is out of this world.  My daughter had the macaroni which is made as pasta with beef with cheese over it and it was really very good.

Lastly, the Prices, I cannot end this without mentioning the prices here...you will find a more reasonable meal in this town then here at this place and the caliber of the food (quality) and care put into the food, this place is a MUST FOR EVERYONE to try..."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"I said we would give this place another try and here we are.  The menu had changed since our last visit, they do have an Eggplant along with other vegetables in a dish on the menu now.

We came in & we were quickly greeted.  We were told to pick our table & the attention given was not bad.  The owner came around to talk to several tables around us but never came to ours until the end of the meal.  Every table that came in before us & after had a basket of bread on their table.  We were NEVER offered bread which is very disappointing.  We even ordered a salad and bread was never offered or brought.

The place did have a good crowd, but unless you are a regular here, it seems like you are treated as a customer versus watching others being treated more like family.  I was not looking for special treatment but equal treatment to all customers since everyone there is spending money.  Why no one every asked if we wanted bread or brought the bread I am not sure.  We mainly only had one guy taking care of us with another guy checking in from time to time.

Overall, this place really has great food.  Carla takes a lot of pride in her food preparation and it shows when it comes to the table.  The only other MINOR issue I had was very little support was given during the ordering process.  What I mean by this is every other place we have been too, when you order your food, steak, fish whatever, they normally let you know what sides it comes with and asks if you want anything else.  The Ribeye here comes with tomatoes but nothing else.  This was never told and no other side (potatoes, other vegetables, etc).  A place like this that carries itself with what seems to be such high standards, you would expect a little more interaction by the staff taking your order.

Again, these are minor things which would not affect my decision to return to this place as I will, but it did make the difference between 5 stars and 3.5 if it were possible to give less then 4 stars.  They do try hard, I am not sure if they read Yelp but this is a place I would definitely return too and encourage readers to do the same, you will not be disappointed with the food."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"I love the store but the bike repair shop is unreliable in my opinion.  I brought my bike in for repair, I was told they had to order the part and I had to wait almost two weeks to be scheduled.
I was also told I would receive a call as soon as the part came in and would be set for Friday to get my bike back Saturday morning.  I also asked about a military discount which I was told I would get that as well.

I don't often slam a place but this one is fully justified, customers keep you in business, you really should care and stand behind what you tell someone.

The FIRST LIE was I would be called when the part came in.  I never received a call so yesterday, Friday I called them and asked about the part and the repair, I was told the part had just came in and if I bring the bike in before they close or first thing in the morning they will get it done for me right away. 

SECOND LIE.  I came in first thing this morning and I was told they would not have it done until possibly Monday.  When I questioned them about the promise of it being done today they said they could try and squeeze me in but there was no guarantee and it would most likely be Monday.
I told them I would just take the parts and figure it out myself.  

THIRD LIE.   When he rang up the parts I asked about the military discount to which this guy said we don't do military discounts, we give a percentage back to our member in our loyalty club.  When I told him the guy who wrote the ticket said I would receive one his response was, ""we are all seasoned employees back here I don't know why you would have been told that, do you know who you talked to?""

Three strikes normally you're  are out.  Well here is an update..a FOURTH STRIKE...the so called seasoned employee I showed my bike to and showed him what part I needed, when I got home the parts they ordered were the WRONG parts for my bike, seasoned????  At what is my question???   Really disappointed in this entire experience.

I talked to the guy who places the order for the parts, he said he will talk to the shop manager and the store manager and they will see what can be done to make this right.  We will see what happens and how long it takes."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"So this is the sister store of Brio which is why everything looked very familiar down to a good portion of the menu.  We came in for lunch and ordered two drinks which the guy behind the bar made.  They were AMAZING.  The ambiance of the place is nice, it is definitely something this mall needed, it still had the new smell and new look feel to it.

We ordered our food and relaxed.  After we were finished with the first drink we ordered another drink and this time the female bartender made the drink.  Even though we ordered the same drinks, these two were horrible.  First they did not look like the same drinks, they did not taste like the same drinks and when we told our server, she did take the drinks back and have the guy makes them again, but then came back and tried to defend the bartender telling us they were new drinks and the bartender's were still learning how to make the drinks, that the first guy followed the recipe while he was making the drink and the girl probably did not.  

So TWO things here....ONE, you saw the first drinks because you brought them to our table.  You saw the second drinks did not look anything like the first drinks so you should have taken care of that before bringing them to the table.  SECOND, don't try and defend the bartender, they were hired because they were supposed to know how to make drinks and anyone behind the bar should follow the recipe if they don't know how to make it.  This place is still new as we were charged for 6 drinks instead of 4, the server caught that when she brought the bill and took it to the manager to take 2 drinks off, they would have gotten 3 stars if they not only took off the two drinks we sent back because they were not made right but also taken off 2 more for a good gesture.

Of course this reflects on the management and the fact that the server wanted to try and justify why the bartender made the drinks wrong instead of apologizing and getting it fixed, shows it more about the staff rather then the customers.

They should do good here either way, I just don't know if it is a place we will go back to.  We have been to the sister store several times (Brio) and they always put the customers first."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"We've been here a few times for Happy Hour and really like the food so we decided to try the Sunday Brunch.

They have a small but decent selection of food to choose from along with bottomless brunch drinks.  For the Bloody Mary's they have a Buffett style of condiments for your Bloody Mary which is pretty cool, they bring you the drink and you go get whatever you want to dress it up.

Our server, I give him a rating of Fair performance at best.  I asked for a Bloody Maria, (tequila instead of vodka), I made it VERY CLEAR I do not drink Vodka and would like a Bloody Maria with tequila, you think he listened???  Nope I was served a regular Bloody Mary made with Vodka???

They brought some what they say are complimentary from the chef mini muffins, of course they had cinnamon (why not after all), unfortunately I can't have cinnamon.  Then I was told they cannot make French Toast without cinnamon, so I had to order something else.  I got the chicken & waffles which were better then other places I've tried but were just ok.  The seasoning used was bland and the chicken very dry.  The waffles were not bad, they had jalapeños in them but were not spicy at all.  My wife had the eggs & polenta, she was not impressed, again it was ok at best.

Back to the Bloody Mary, for some reason my wife did not like hers and did not drink it at all.  The manager I believe he was came by just to say hi and see how things were going?  My wife told him she did not like the drink and could not drink it.  His response?  I'm sorry, I guess I'll have to drink it.  I hope he enjoyed the $20 drink we paid for because they never took it off our bill and never offered her something else.

They try hard and the food is not bad however, it's not about the customer here but the bottom dollar (it appears).  Most places would have removed that drink from our bill immediately, however instead they charged us the bottomless price for the drink $20 instead of just one drink by the glass???  Even that would have been acceptable.

We were not impressed with the brunch and probably will not go back for it again.  Happy Hour is a maybe at best, but I tend to shy away from places that don't take allergies seriously."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"We've been renting here for almost 3 years.  When we signed our lease Robinson Property Management was in charge of the property.  Shortly after we rented Colony American took over.  This was still a pretty decent company that at the time I thought was a great company to rent from.
We've never had any problems, small things we fixed ourselves, large things we always got fixed by the company right away.  Customer service was great and I felt like they really cared.

Then along came Waypoint homes and almost immediately the customer service disappeared.  The maintenance is handled by a company out of Chicago (SMS) who many times are clueless.  When you put in a maintenance request and a technician is sent out to inspect the issue, his work order NEVER matches the maintenance request that was put in.  A lot of stuff gets left off of the work order.

I never had a real problem until we started to have issues with the pool equipment.  I've come to find out they have over 2000 properties and only about 250 have pools and this company would rather not have any pools on their properties.  What this means is when there is a problem, rather then fix it they just fill the pool in with dirt and rocks.  It does not matter what your lease says or what your were promised when you signed the lease.

Our pump and heater developed a problem, equipment almost 20 yrs old.  They agreed to fix the pump but refuse to replace the heater even with a smaller cheaper one.  My wife needs the heated spa for her cancer treatment and they just don't care.  We've spent a LOT of money out of our own pockets to enhance the property value and this company just no longer cares about its residents, they only care about making money.  

Needless to say we will not be renewing our lease, nor will we EVER recommend this company.  Their refusal to fix the heater for the spa is a clear indication that they don't care about residents, residents health or well being or how much you've done to enhance the property out of pocket.  They only care about themselves and the money.

Like I said we will not renew the lease, however their refusal to fix the heater and help support the needs of a cancer patient, this part of the discussion is not over.   We plan to help this company out with lots of publicity."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"I purchased my truck here and this is the second time I've come in for service.  The first visit was just for an oil change and this time I came in for an oil change, a recall on my truck and an issue with my driver door.  Drew who took care of me last time said it would be about 2 1/2 to 3 hours and he was right on.  They got everything done except the door issue as they had to order a part which Drew said will be in today and tomorrow I will take my truck back and they will have it all done in about an hour.

I've never had any issues with place from Sales to Service.  This place is one of the best dealers I've worked with in Service.  The service writers are very friendly if you are friendly with them.  Two of the service writers are Marine Veterans and being a Navy Veteran myself, we have fun when I go in there.

Its a service department at a dealership, how can people give this place a bad review?  You decided to purchase a vehicle instead of taking the bus.  Your vehicle has issues, none are perfect, you either cannot or don't desire to fix it yourself.  You HAVE the choice as to where to bring your vehicle for repair.  I have a few friends who own vehicle repair garages and I've worked at a dealership in the past, they all have the same process.  They take the cars in as they are received, the do their best to diagnose the issue as quickly as possible, they have to get authorization from the warranty company if you have one before the work can be performed, instead of sitting around doing nothing they start work on another vehicle while waiting for approval on yours, if parts are needed they have to get the parts from the parts department once they are finished or did as much as they could on the vehicle they started working on while waiting for approval on yours and then they can get the work done.  Is there such as thing as a PERFECT mechanic?  NOT IF THEY ARE HUMAN.

I don't know what other reviewers expectations are when they take their vehicle to a garage, but you are not the only person on this planet needing work done to your vehicle, you are no more important then the person in front of you, there are easy fixes and complicated repairs....we all need to have patience and remember to treat other as you would want them to treat you....I highly recommend this dealership and if you are looking for a truck send me a message and I'll recommend someone to you."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"So I checked in a the wrong one, I visited the one at Town Square.  When we got there at 5:30ish on a Monday night is was empty, only 2 tables besides ours.  There was only ONE server for the entire place.  She was nice and came over pretty quick and took our drink orders.  She also explained the specials but we were there for a drink and dessert.

She took our order the fondue and it came pretty quick.  It started going down hill from there.

The manager seemed nice but lacks leadership and team building abilities.  I have never seen so many people walk around and do NOTHING to help each other out.  Oh there is ONE thing everybody does and when it comes to celebrating your birthday, everyone from the manager on down participates and then they go back to ignoring the customers.

A few more tables came in and our server had to attend to them.  She spent a good solid 5 minutes with one and during that time NO ONE including the manager came over and asked if we needed anything or checked our drinks nothing.  Two employees walked past our table and clearly saw our drinks were empty and we were just sitting there and never said a word.

When our server was finished with the new table I grabbed her as she passed us without looking at us and asked for a black regular coffee.  It took almost 15 minutes to get that coffee, REALLY??

Then the Bartendar disappeared and our server became the Bartendar and we were left alone.  Then I watched the manager go behind the bar and spend a good 5 minutes just chatting with our server instead of helping her with her tables.

We finally got our bill and left.  Team work does not exist in this place and it starts from the manager on down but if you have a birthday to celebrate, the manager will be very quick to grab the computer that controls the music and will blast the birthday song and be focused enough to watch to see when the singing is done so she can turn the song off and turn the volume down, the she goes back to just walking around and not paying attention to tables.

It's sad because they all have great potential, someone just needs to train everyone to be a team instead of individuals.    Needless to say we will not be back as the value for what you got along with the lack of service & attention to customers is not a high priority.  Better food, cheaper prices with a teamwork attitude is available in too many other places.  We did not order enough stuff for it to take 2 hours."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"Never seems to disappoint.  The bartenders are very warm, friendly and make amazing drinks.  You are not just a customer here, they want you to feel like family.  The food is good however, not everyone that works here speaks and understands English.  

I came with a group and one of the people in our group is allergic to raw tomatoes and we had a real hard time explaining this to them.  One guy had no idea what she was saying and called over another guy who somewhat understood but was still confused.  The girl making the tortillas had no idea what was being said but glad to say she got some AMAZING tacos with no tomatoes of any kind on them.

There is nothing on the menu I can say is bad here however some of the items were very salty.  One person in the group go a Chorizo taco and was way too salty for her.  She gave it to me and even I could tell it was very salty but that was the first time I tried the chorizo here so I do not have another experience to compare it to.

The Al Pastor is Amazing, the Pollo tacos, burritos amazing.  The Mexican Corn on the Cob, WOW that is some good stuff.  The Mole Fries, sweet potato fries with cheese, mole, chicken, is your mouth watering yet....get a margarita to wash it down and you will be in heaven.

The owners were here again on this visit which I mentioned in my last review...They were busy but I need to address something here. 

They are young, beautiful, successful women who have a place that makes amazing food and has a great atmosphere.  I did get a response to my last review where I mentioned the owners did not seem real friendly to the customers, they basically ignored everyone instead of saying hi and see how things were going.  The response was that they used to do this but some people took offense to this and thought they were flitting with people when they came to your table.

First off, they can flirt with me anytime...Second, this is their business and it shows a lot of Pride and Satisfaction in an owner who walks around, welcomes you and thanks you for coming into their business.  If anyone takes offense to this, then go eat somewhere else.  NEVER NEVER NEVER put an owner of an establishment down or say they are flirting with you or someone you are with when all they are doing is QUALITY CHECKING the Satisfaction of the Customer.  You SHOULD ONLY BE SO LUCKY IF THEY WERE TO FLIRT WITH YOU!!!

This place has great food as stated above and everyone should try this place."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"This was my first visit to this place.  I have seen it advertised on TV and Neal's face on Fox 5 as well as other places.  I have a friend who wanted to get a price on something and to see if it was real so I decided to give this place a shot.  I read a lot of the reviews, both good and bad but felt it was worth experiencing for myself.

The building itself is easy to find, outside on the windows they boast about supporting Veterans which I am one and it is VERY CLEARLY marked outside that ""No Firearms"" allowed inside.  The location of this business can be an interesting area both good and bad.

When you walk in the door before the door even closes behind you, you are immediately approached by a guy with a gun asking you what you need?  Really???  Immediately met with intimidation, give me a break....I have been to extremely HIGH END jewellery stores here in town with an armed guard and you are given a very warm and friendly welcome not met by some yahoo with a license to carry a gun who wants to act like a bad ass because he has a gun strapped to his hip.  

Once you get past this jerk if you are lucky enough because he determines whether you are allowed to enter the place you are led to a counter.  There were two guys on the phone behind the counter so while I waited I glanced around and not one person was in that place without a gun clearly visible on their hip.

I ended up dealing with Neal who was very pleasant and I feel EXTREMELY honest in his assessment of the items I brought in.  I asked for his opinion on what I should do with the items as they were not really something he felt was worth much money at all which I agreed with, and he was very happy to help.

So, overall impression, this is NOT a warm and friendly place to do business coming in the door, however if you are lucky enough to get past the fool at the door, I believe you will find the rest of your experience to be a lot more enjoyable.  

Personally, I prefer to deal with a business that is warm, friendly, inviting and wants your business whether selling or buying,, not one that wants to intimidate the heck out of you as soon as you walk in the door.  Anyone can get a license to carry a gun, you don't have to be a jerk about it.  Being retired military, all I can say is he is lucky that gun never left his holster because if it did, he would not enjoy sitting down today with a piece of metal stuffed in a different place.  There are other places in town that desire you to come in and next time, I will try one of those."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"This place is AMAZING.....First off if you missed it in the name of this place, its ORGANIC and GLUTEN FREE and it tastes amazing.

This place is located almost right off the 15 freeway on Loose Rd.  Its in a store front and inside the place its very nicely decorated with only about 4, 4 top tables and a small bar area with 4 seats.   MIckel the chef and Grace who takes care of everything else out front are two unbelievable people.  They both take a lot of pride in what they do and how it's done and the knowledge Mickel has when it comes to Gluten Free, NON GMO food preparation is above anyone I've talked to in a long time in the cooking world.  They are open and friendly people.

I started out with an Organic Smoothie, the Mango Monkey and it was just SO good, I can't wait to go back and get another one.  Then we had the Bammy Fried Chicken which is actually breaded with cassava flour which Mikel takes the time to create himself.  You have two choices on the meal based on how many chicken fingers you want, the smaller one is perfect for one person as it comes with fried plantains, rice and  organic spring mix.

I had the Smoked Jerk Wings and they were the tastiest wings I've ever had.  The spice rub Mickel uses, a secret I don't know yet but WOW, they were nothing short of amazing.  The wings came as a meal so I also got the fried plantains, I did not want the rice so I had the organic spring mix and some chilled cabbage & carrots.  They did not last long as I devoured both of them.

Normally I am NOT a dessert person, HOWEVER, Mickel, did I mention how amazing of a Chef and Creator this guy is, he has a Homemade Gluten Free Vanilla Rum Cake, OMG!!!

Fellow Yelpers, I LOVE me some Rum Cake and I have put away many Rum Cakes (explains why I am on a diet now) with the exception of this Rum Cake, I will NEVER be on a diet for this.  Yelpers, this is THE BEST TASTING RUM CAKE I have ever had and I can almost promise you, no matter where I travel to, I will NEVER find another Rum Cake like the one Mickel created.  I see no need to ever try another Rum Cake, I'll just be disappointed and why bother.

This is a place I give a HUGE recommendation for, that you should try.  There is no other place with this kind of food and flavor in this town.  You have to go and tell Mickel I sent you.  You will NOT receive a discount or anything for free, but maybe he will give me a bigger piece of Rum Cake next time I go in if you mention my name and I will openly appreciate you for that).  I will be back to this place and will try something new next time."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"So heres the deal....If you have an issue with gluten, this place says they can make you a gluten free crust if you give then 24 hours to prepare it.  I guess they do not get enough requests to have this on hand.  I don't know anyone who plans 24 hours in advance to go eat pizza, its more like, I feel like pizza today and you will be out of luck if you cannot pre-plan your visit.

Now they will give you the option to walk over to Whole Foods, purchase your own Gluten Free crust and bring the curst over and they will give you a WHOPPING $2 discount off of $13 pizza.  Well, this SUCKS for you but works for them.  The crust you purchased is $7.99 and the toppings they put on the pizza is NOT WORTH $11.  Portions of the crust had NO toppings or Cheese, so what I paid $11 for, I have no idea.

ALSO, if you order the sausage at this place, they pre cook the sausage part way so when you order it, it can finish cooking in the oven with your pizza.  HOWEVER, if you bring your own Gluten Free crust in, they cannot put the crust all the way in the oven because it will burn the crust.  The problem with this issue, is they do NOTHING to finish cooking the sausage, so you end up with RAW sausage and cold pizza.

If you look at Whole Foods, they now have Gluten Free Pizza's for $4.99 you can take home and cook yourself which tastes way better then the $11 cold pizza served with RAW Uncooked Sausage.  

I guess they don't concern themselves with serving people RAW unsafe meat.  NOW, in THEIR DEFENSE, they did offer to go purchase another crust for me to which I said no thank you, AND they did not charge us for the pizza which did not get eaten, which was a nice gesture for something that was not eaten.  Needless to say, this is a place to NEVER VISIT AGAIN if for nothing else other then, HOW CAN A REAL CHEF/COOK nor anyone else working there NOT notice the center of the pizza looking uncooked (Cheese not melted completely, FIRST CLUE).  This is their specialty and there is no excuse for an expert to not be able to tell the difference between a fully cooked pizza and one that did not get cooked in the center.  This should have been their first clue that maybe, just maybe, the sausage did not get cooked either.

Maybe if the management here were to read these reviews they would see a pattern here in 2013 of people saying the service is EH, the pizza lacked toppings, etc.  

There are way better places to get pizza in this town especially who have GREAT SERVICE, they don't charge $13 plus dollars for crust with skimpy toppings.  They keep this practice going this year, it will be interesting to see where they are or if they are next year."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"LOYAL CUSTOMER NO MORE!!!!!

I purchased my tires here & along with the purchase comes free rotation, balancing & alignment. (It really does not come with it, you have to pay for it)  I came in & asked for my tires to be ROTATED & BALANCED.  Geoff one of the service managers asked if I wanted the Alignment checked, he said it was free, so I said ok.

I believe Geoff and Ernie are great guys, however, they are CLUELESS as to what is happening in the garage behind them & I find this difficult to understand since they both spend a lot of time in the garage chatting with the other mechanoics when it is slow in front.  There is nothing wrong with that, BUT you would think they would be paying attention to what is happening on the vehicles they write up & send back.

I asked how long it would take & I was told they were not busy so they should get it in right away.  After about 15 minutes this guy takes my truck to a bay on the other side of the shop.  I did not feel like sitting inside so I went outside to enjoy the day and watch him work on my vehicle.

I watched him slowly walk around the garage looking for tools, finally start working on my vehicle.  SERIOUSLY, IT TOOK THIS GUY 45 MINUTES TO take my tires off my vehicle and move them around & tighten the lug nuts back up.  REALLY???  A school kid can do that faster.

This guy then brings my truck back up front and spends more time writting something on the paper then hands it to Ernie & walks away.  Ernie hands me the keys & tells me my vehicle is done.  I said really, can I have a print out of what was done.

Ernie told me the tires were rotated, balanced and the alignment was checked....BUSTED!!!!

I told Ernie, SORRY, all this guy did was take the tires off & rotate them, HE DID NOT DO A BALANCE ON THE TIRES, HE DID NOT CHECK THE ALIGNMENT, HE DIDN'T EVEN CHECK THE TIRE PRESSURE. 

Ernie's response was, ""I'm sorry, I will have to have a talk with him, let me have your keys & we will get it done"".  By this time, an HOUR LATER, the shop was busy & I told him no, I did not have any more time to wait.

I DO NOT LIKE TO BE LIED TO!!!!  In Ernie's defense he did not lie, he stated what he thought his employee did.  As a Manager, you BETTER KNOW CONFIDENTLY that your employees are doing what you are telling your customer.  I had reservations about this place in the past & NOW I KNOW FOR SURE... I WILL NOT BE BACK THERE EVER!!!!!!  

BOTTOM LINE PEOPLE:  

IF YOU TAKE YOUR VEHICLE HERE, YOU BETTER MAKE SURE THE SERVICE YOU REQUESTED IS BEING PERFORMED, BECAUSE THE RED SHIRTS UP FRONT ARE NOT & APPARENTLY NO ONE IN THE GARAGE IS IN CHAGE OF MAKING SURE THE WORK REQUESTED IS BEING PERFORMED....."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"Back in November 2011, I visited this place and gave it 5 stars.  Since that time, I have been here a few more times.  If there was a way to give a place 2.5 stars, I would now give this place that rating.

You may be asking what caused this place to go from 5 stars to 2.5 stars in my opinion.  Please let me answer this burning question for you.

Since November 2011, their menu changed as well as the staff.  This place now seems to follow the Lindo family and what once seemed like a stand alone even if it were not, no longer carries itself as such.  It is a more of a chain like Misty said six months ago.  

The food quality has changed some and now it is a crap shoot on whether you will get a good meal here or not.  Sometimes the food is really good and sometimes it is just ok.  

The most interesting part of this entire change, is that they always seemed surprised you are there.  They still have the buffet on weekends, but the service has gone way down.  Getting a seat never seems to be a problem here, but getting service, now that is another story and may cause this place to drop to a solid 2 star in the near future.

We went there this morning and the servers always seem surprised that people actually want to eat here and showed up to do so.  On this visit, it was like they only had one server to cover the entire place inside and out, with one helper for drinks and food delivery.  I asked for coffee for my drink and the waiter forget like three times.  Our chips ran out and we were NEVER asked if we wanted more.  I asked for Habanero sauce for my food and he forgot again twice.  My coffee ran out and after seeing him come around several times to other tables to see if they needed anything, I finally called him over and asked for more coffee.  Yes, he forgot.

After I asked again and he forgot again, he finally came back over with the pot and apologized for taking so long.  I guess he realized he forgot again.

This place is ok for the food and price, but the service is has gone way down hill to like I said, they are almost always surprised people actually come in and they are always understaffed.  I don't understand the logic of a place that opens the door for business, gets the business almost every night, is packed on weekends and yet does not realize they need more staff.  I will give this place another chance, but there is a MUCH better place just down the road in a casino which has much better service, way better food, the chips are awesome and you serve yourself the salsa and chips so if you run out at this place down road, ITS YOUR OWN FAULT.  

But my review is not about that place, but about this one and if the service does not improve, people may start looking for a better place...."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"We decided to try this place based on the recommendation of a friend.  We went here for lunch and of course after reading the reviews of friends on Yelp, I felt like it was a place we could probably enjoy.  Of course the BEST BBQ we have had was in Southern Texas in a little rink a dink town called Ozona in a small gas station converted to a restaurant.

Back to this place, you walk in and you feel like you are in a Texas place, all wooden picnic style tables with a few smaller 4 seat tables make out of cable reels but fixed up really nice.  The place was clean and you are led through a line to the counter where there is a menu posted on the glass and a guy taking your order.  The smell of the smoked style cooking hits you when you walk in the door and depending on the type of clothing you wear, (meaning if it absorbs smells, you will leave smelling like a smoke house, that's what you call wearing your lunch out and having it linger.

They have chicken, pork, brisket, tri-tip, turkey, and of course ribs, beef and pork.  You have a choice of 1, 2, or 3 meat plate or a smoked salmon.  You also have the option to purchase everything by the half pound or full pound if you want more and the ribs a half rack or full.  The baby backs are $26 for a full slab and $36 for the beef ribs.

I opted for the 3 meat plate and took the ribs, chicken and tri-tip.  I will have to go back to try the brisket.  It comes with 2 sides which there are 10 to choose from so if you don't like making choices, well just ask the person taking your order what their favorites are and they will be more then happy to tell you because they eat there as well.

For my sides I choose the BBQ Beans and Potato Salad.  I also took and order of corn bread, I love me some corn bread.  The ribs were good, pulled off the bone, the chicken was tender and very tasty, the tri-tip was dry but soft and adding some sauce to it which they have on the table made it enjoyable to eat.  The BBQ Beans and Potato Salad were both really really really good.  Neither one of use were offered or given a few slices of bread which another review stated he was offered and it does not say that on the menu so I am guessing he was special.

Next time I go back I will have to ask about that.  The staff are all very friendly and willing to help even after you sit down at the table with your food, they come by and make sure all is ok.  You can get beer, wine, they have an electronic soda machine which give you a lot of choices of drinks from caffeine free to low calorie to the full sugar me up kind.  They also have a separate selection of ice tea from sweet to unsweetened.  

Overall I like this place, the sauces were good the food was good and the staff were amazing.  The corn bread was ok, it was more like a sweet cake.  I will be back."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"The last time we were here was on my birthday back in August and the service was great, the food was mixed for people in the party.  Went here on 12/31/15 as we were close by, the place was busy but we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.

Once seated the service was very slow.  I ordered a hot tea and had to wait 15 minutes and keep asking the server before he could find me a pot for my tea and bring it to the table.  My wife ordered a Pinot noir which took forever and we had to ask twice for that as well.  The glass did not appear to be as clean as it should have been and my wife said it had a salt taste on it.  She also ordered a kale salad.  I had the orange peel chicken which was ok, nothing special.

Later that evening around 11:30 my wife started getting violently ill, all the signs of food poisoning.  Needless to say it was not a good night and Friday was a long day in bed.  We did not eat out anywhere else so it had to come from cross contamination in something here.  

Not sure what happened on Thursday at this place but they need to figure out what went wrong with the glass washing or food handling.  The quality was just not as good on Thursday as it had been in the past and they were definitely overwhelmed.  The service was not good on this day, according to our server running out of tea pots and trying to keep up.  Seeing how long it took to get a glass of wine and then noticing the glass was not entirely clean, not sure what happened in the back area but we will probably not be back to this place for sometime.  My wife never gets sick like that and this was the only place we went to and the experience seemed concerning to begin with.

So the kicker, my wife called and talked to a manager who basically did not want to accept any responsibility and told her she should have gone to the doctor to be tested to prove it was food poisoning and it came from them.  It is strange how the manager knew exactly what my wife was talking about in relation to the taste on the glass but still refused to accept any responsibility.  The manager did say the chemical they use to clean the glasses is what could have caused the problem as it was supposed to be washed off completely and this may not have happened.  The chemical they use is very strong and if not washed completely off could have caused this.  The call from us was a courtesy call but was not accepted as one.  I guess we won't be back to this place....

Quick update, this manager we talked to over the weekend said a GM would call my wife on Monday, today is Wednesday and still no call, says a lot about that location.  Refused to accept responsibility, clearly stated what they felt the issue was because it's happened before, but still never said sorry, never offered anything in return, last $100 we will ever spend at that location...."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"I did not check Yelp, bad on my part however, we went to this store and purchased a couch for us and a king bed with two mattresses for the bottom as we have a king mattress for the top.

The couch came on time as promised, however the bed we are still waiting on which we were told would only be like 3 to 5 days which was back on December 16th.

The quality of the couch is great and I am fully satisfied with the purchase.....The 1 star is for CUSTOMER SERVICE....This statement below is a bunch of BS as they do not care and they do not read the reviews or care about the reviews as best as I can tell.

Locally owned and operated, 
Big's Furniture takes pride in its community and service to the local market.  From our home to yours...

I financed a majority of the furniture I purchased and when I finally got the bill from the financing company the Henderson store charged me TWICE for my purchase.  I called the financial company and they told me I had talk to the store.  

Well NO MATTER WHAT NUMBER YOU CALL, it goes to the store at the other location on the other side of town and they have to transfer you to the Henderson store because that is where everyone seems to be located from the accountant, management, etc...Getting a live person is near impossible at the Henderson store.  I had to call back 4 times and get real nasty with the girl before she decided to put me on hold and get a live person herself before transferring me over.  

I finally got to Elaine a Customer Service Manager who said the accountant was there, they did notice yesterday the two charges and took action to correct it.  I asked why no one called me to let me know about this instead of me having to call the finance company and then call them and I was told that the accountant does not deal with customers and the information was passed to the girl at the OTHER store I talked to yesterday and she does not come in until 4pm today so she will probably call me then, REALLY???  This made no sense to me and when I told Elaine that she seemed to just get frustrated with me.  

WELL, THIS WAS NOT MY FAULT, IT WAS THEIRS AND I AM ANNOYED AS IT IS MY CREDIT THEY ARE MESSING WITH TO SAY IT NICELY.....

I was told a truck did come in today and they have the box springs and will deliver it tomorrow.

All I can say is that dealing with the salesperson the day we went in was AWESOME, but if you don't get what you need that day or if you have any other issue, its all luck on the getting it resolved.

I do THANK ELAINE though for all her help, but it makes it hard to recommend a place that makes it extremely easy to purchase but if you don't take it with you that day, customer service when calling is nothing short of an EXTREME NIGHTMARE.  They have quality items but beware of the support once you walk out the door that is definitely a 1 star...."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"We found this place via a friend on Facebook who came here and said on FB it was GMO Free and the food was amazing.  As usual, I went onto Yelp and a majority of the reviews were 5 stars but if you go a ways down you will find some 4's and below.  We decided to try this place for lunch today because of the hype on GMO Free, Organic and amazing.  Since others have mentioned the excellent servers they have had let me tell you about our server Victor.  It took him a long time to get to our table, good thing for the hostess as she got us our drinks and took our appetizer order.  Victor finally came and proceeded to go over the entire menu trying to sell us on everything that were his favorites which seemed to be everything but this place still has not had its grand opening.  

I don't want to be sold on food, let me try it and give my opinion.  He seemed really off today and later you will understand why.  He brought out our appetizer, Tostaditas De Tinga's, 3 small tostada's with white meat chicken and sauce.  When he got to the table, he dumped one of the tostada's on my wife...He was very apologetic and cleaned it up quickly and brought us a new order on the house.  He also tried to explain being off on his sick daughter from the day before but then we heard him tell the table next to us that he had been next door at the Sapphire Club all night.  By the way, this is the same building as  the Sapphire Gentlemen's Club, the same parking lot and the same owners...

Chef Paco who everyone talked about in their reviews obviously was not here today.  Our appetizer lacked in seasoning, all white meat chicken boiled and not like what you would find in Mexico.  We had the table side guacamole which was pretty good, but the Carne Asada Taco's and the Al Pastor Taco's lacked in taste as well compared to the authentic foods of Mexico.  The rice was white rice with no seasoning at all, very bland.  The beans tasted like canned beans, which brings up a funny story...Our waiter first said the beans were from a can but then came back and said he talked to one of the cooks who said they were not canned, they were made in house daily.  NOT...

The Flan was good but did not seem like home made daily like they claim.  Any chicken dish from the Tostada's to the pulled chicken burrito I brought my daughter was very bland.  Needless to say we were very disappointed as we were hoping for an amazing meal, GMO Free and Organic however the corn tortillas did not taste like fresh corn tortillas.    

This is not a place we will go back to as you can find better tasting authentic mexican food about anywhere in town.  I am sure Chef Paco is an amazing person but whether he is there or not, the menu items should always be cooked the same way and if they were going for what you would find in Mexico, the mark was really missed here."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"The food here is close to 4 stars.  For the food you get, I feel the prices are reasonable.  So with that being said why 2 stars???

Clearly the SERVICE, it is one of the wrost in this town, unless you are out for at least a 2 hour ONE course meal.  Really????

This has been the case the last few times we went.  So why go back?  It is close to home and I thought they might have it figured out...NOPE...

Why would you have 2 people to handle the front door and ONLY ONE Waiter to take care of tables????  Why have 3 runners and only one waiter???  This place has been understaffed for a long time and I just don't understand the logic.  It is not that hard to have 2 full time waiters.

We went last night, we were seated and told our waiter was Mark.  Close to 10 minutes LITERALLY, before he came over and asked for a drink order.  Two drinks came and away he went, no ask of an appetizer, nothing.  Another person came and ordered an Iced Tea and a hot tea was ordered as well.  LITERALLY FIVE minutes to get the teas.  Finally an ask was made for appetizers and one ordered along with the food.

The appetizer came and was eaten very very slowly and aboiut the time we finished eating it, the food came. 

NOW, in the defense of the restaurant, the food ordered did take some time to prepare and was prepared with quality, care and appreciation for what was being served.  A request was made for more hot tea which took the 5 minute waiting game again.  Once we were done, the plates were removed from the table in record speed...why can't accompish this with drinks and refills??

We did not want desert, we asked for the left overs to be placed in seperate bags as we were going in two directions.  So do you think the SAME guy who took the plates remembered who got what left overs???  NO, this morning it was discovered this task, which was only 3 plates was WAY ABOVE the level of competence of the guy who took the plates.

We asked for our bill and then watched the waiter run around, do several other things and pass our table several times before he finally came back and gave us our bill.  This whole process of getting the bill, 10 mintues...Needless to say we paid cash as we did not want to wait for him to take the card and never come back even though at this point we were one of ONLY 4 tables in the place.  

He is a nice guy, but handling more then two 4 tops for him at a time, not a good idea...if you are going to keep the doors open to a certain time and have 2 people at the door, 3 runners including the manager, more then one server would be a good idea.

I believe we are done with this place unless we come across a day that we can spend 3 hours in a place to get a salad and a meal.  There are places in town with comparable prices if not better, with comparable food if not better and service that will BLOW THiS PLACE AWAY...."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"We have not been here for a long time and decided to try it for my son in laws birthday as a personal friend of mine said he personally knew the owners really well.  I called and made a reservation and the table was ready for us when we arrived.  Our reservation was for 8 people but only 6 showed which I think threw the waiter off at the beginning.  

We were seated and sat for some time before someone came and offered us drinks.  My wife does not like regular water and ordered two large bottles of water.   Now they charge almost $5 per bottle, the busboy filled all the glasses brought bread and then we sat and waited and waited and waited and waited.  Finally I had to flag down a busboy and ask him to let our waiter know the other 2 were not coming and we were ready to order.  He said he would take care of it, removed 2 menus from the table and proceeded to take the rest of the stuff from those 2 seats.  He picked up one glass he had just filled up earlier and turned it over dumping all the water in the full glass all over the table.  He felt bad and I don't understand how he could not see or feel the glass full, but he never offered to replace the water from the bottle we were being charged for.

Finally the waiter came over and took our order, someone brought out the salads and soup, we asked for more bread, he said ok and it never came.  Just as we were done with this course the guy who dumped the water all over the table came by and asked if we wanted more bread, took two baskets and came back with one.

The food was good, some portions matched the price and some did not.  I had the prime rib which was $30, it was 18oz's and pretty good however the vegetables we a very small portion.  My daughter ordered a chicken dish for $20 and it was not worth the price and the amount of pasta they gave her, really???  Pasta is a cheap food and for the amount of chicken they gave her, there should have been more.

Overall the service was not that great.  I watched other tables getting more attention then ours which was a little frustrating since for the price you pay, everyone should receive the best service.  Above and beyond that, for someone personally knowing the owners, I would think they would try a little harder to give a better impression.  Then dessert time, everyone ordered dessert except me, I got coffee..my wife ordered coffee and dessert and it never came.

For 6 people our bill came to over $220 which for the food which was ok, portions could have been better, the service could have been way better, the water we paid for which was dumped on the table by the staff not us, should have been offered to have been replaced, I must say, I can find better quality food in this town off the strip for less money with better service.  We probably will not go back to this place again as the value should have been better and when I am paying for water, if you spill it, you should replace it or not charge me for it.  Overall, I was disappointed."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"This was my second visit to Nora's in the past week.  We stopped in for lunch one day because we have heard from two people how good this place is.  Lunch prices are very reasonable and the food is amazing.  

The lunch service was a little slow but I'll tell you what, the FOOD was worth the wait.  We got the Steak and Arugula Bruschetta as an appetizer and it was out of this world!!!   AMAZING!!!  They do bring you a small basket of Garlic Bread, the first one is on them the menu says and then $2.50 after that.  The bread is amazing but when you get a basket with just 4 small pieces for two people and then want to charge me $2.50 for another 4 pieces, that I may question.

I had the Rigatoni Special and the sauce, the sausage, the meatballs, OMG... we also a Nora special which is not on the togo menu so I cannot tell you the exact name but I was told it was the BEST they have ever had.

So since our experience with the food was SO AMAZING, we decided to go back last night and bring my daughter and her husband.  Of course we had the Steak and Arugula Bruschetta and they ordered the regular Bruschetta and both were again very good.  We also ordered the regular Antipasto Salad which we have had in a lot of Italian places and this was by far the BEST.

This time I decided to try the Chicken Parmigiana which you can get breaded or not and it was AMAZING..  The portion size was give me a to go box size which I did take home.  We also had the Veal Chop Parm, a $42 plate but I tell you what, the size of this Bone in Veal was so big, it came home and provided two more meals.  My daughter had the baked Rigatoni and her husband had the Snow White Pizza.  I guess he was having a Disney moment.  

Both dishes were amazing and to go boxes were in order for those as well.  he ordered the medium pizza and it was big enough for 2 to 3 people.  

They all wanted deserts and OMG, the cheesecake is to DIE for, no you won't die if you eat it but after all the food you might explode, the Cookies and Cream Tartufo was amazing, the Panna Cotta was WOW and then a Toasted coconut drink with drambui, and brandy was the topping on the meal.

My friend Frank from AZ comes here all the time and this place was packed non stop last night until about 8:30 then it started to slow down, but I truly understand why Frank says there is NO PLACE like this in Vegas for food of this quality.  Everyone from the hostess to the Manager last night were some of the warmest and friendliest people who ensured the place was running like a well oiled machine and they did an AMAZING JOB!!!  Many kudos to the kitchen and the entire staff, this is one of the BEST Italian places we have ever found her in Las Vegas and HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place and we will be back often, it is just that good.

They do not give military discounts but that is ok, this place is so good I will support them and so should you.  The prices are very reasonable and it is worth every penny.  I don't want to see corners cut to provide a discount and GOOD FOOD is worth paying for and this place is for REAL!!!!"
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"Like David who was here about two weeks ago, this is a place I would not return to.  This was our second experience here and like David said the chips are ok, but that is about it.  The cheese they use is not good, the salsa you can make at home and make it taste better and the food was average.

What seems to attract people to this place is the happy hour times which offers 2 for 1 drinks.  It seems like they are surviving off the bar and NOT the food.  

On the bottom of the receipt is CLEARLY states GREAT MEXICAN FOOD NOTHING OVER 10.$.  This is exactly how it is written..WRONG...They should change this before someone decides to take the time to sue them for false advertising and shuts them down.  

Two people in our party ordered Fajitas and we were charged $11.00 for each.  Now I am not a math wizard, but I do believe that contradicts what they advertise on their receipt.  Also, if you order Enchilada or a burrito, most Mexican Restaurants give you that with rice and beans...NOT THIS PLACE, they charge you $2.00 extra if you want sides with your food bring the total cost of your dish, YOU GUEST IT, to OVER $10.00.  You end up paying anywhere from $10.50 to $13.00 for that plate. 

AND DON'T""T EVEN THINKS OF ASKING FOR MORE TORTILLA'S unless you want to pay $1.00 per request.  

The staff has been very nice on both visits which makes the place bearable...One couple in our party was NOT impressed with the alcohol the first time around and sent their drinks back.  It does look like they took those drinks off the bill even though they FAIL to inform you of this.  They don't inform you of the extra charges or if they do something to benefit you, ITS A SURPRISE AND EVERYONE LOVES SURPRISES WHEN THEY GO OUT TO EAT FROM A RESTAURANT RIGHT???

So one last example, they offer a burrito called enchilada style, which means they put sauce and cheese on the outside.  The burrito is $7.00 but for the scoop of sauce and a little cheese, you guessed it, $2.00 extra and then if you want rice, beans and chips with your burrito, another $2.00 bringing the total to $11.00.....Again $1.00 over the NOTHING OVER $10.00 quote on the receipt.  

Lastly about the Fajita plate, $11.00 is apparently without meat, if you want meat, anther $2.00 and the beans offered on the side, another $2.00, that is a $15.00 plate and in any other restaurant, the price would be the same but would include rice, chips and ALL THE TORTILLA's you desire at NO EXTRA CHARGE.

This is Vegas folks, there are a LOT better Mexican Restaurants in town for the same price of a $13.00 to $15.00 plate with NO HIDDEN CHARGES, better drinks, and just as good Happy Hour Specials.

The ONLY SAVING grace this place has and this is why they will survive in this town David, is that they are close to UNLV so people who don't have cars can indulge, they are not far from the strip and they do have a LOT OF TVs for watching sports and most people don't need more then a few drinks and some chips to munch on while watching a game.  Just make sure you enjoy the chips dry as the VERY SMALL dish of salsa is NOWHERE NEAR enough for the amount of chips you get and YOU WILL GET CHARGED if you ask for MORE....

There are better places to watch sports in this town as well.   Read through the reviews, the 4 stars are from people who enjoy cheap, low alcohol drinks who think they are getting a deal.  Read Ms Fabulous W from 5/15/2011, you will really see what your Happy Hour Drink are getting you....LOL

Maybe Glen Learner the Heavy Hitter would like to get his hands on this receipt."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"First impression of the place, it looks very nice, staff was friendly although seemed very confused at times.

First impression of food, bread, HUGE FAILURE, not homemade, not warm, not worth being served in an Italian restaurant.  Something you can buy at Smith's.  mentioned to our server, got a hmmm response.

Second point, the server came and grabbed a glass of wine off the table she thought was empty, it was not, yet she still walked away very fast.......RUDE!!!!

The staff stand in the dining room and talk to each other as if they are life long friends hanging out rather then staff working in a restaurant with CUSTOMERS.

Next, she brought us the bill before she asked if we wanted desert???

The food was ok, not the best Italian food I have ever had, but what can you expect from a menu that shares itself with hamburgers, sandwiches, BBQ beef, French dip???

The sauce they use for the pasta and lasagna was really good sauce.  They do have a menu of $10 items.

So why the two stars, well that would have to be the ok food and less then on service.  We asked the server if the salmon was Wild or Farm raised, she did not know, went to ask and came back saying it was Atlantic???

We asked towards the end if the meal if the owner was there to which we were told the owners son was, but instead we got a girl who said she was the manager.  The issues with this place become more and more obvious each step of the way.

So let me say here, the common ground between this location and the one on Durango, especially in reading other reviews, is the service and when you meet the manager, you understand why....poor leadership results in poor service.  So let me continue.

We first share with her about the bread and the answer we got was ""Oh, that is not our normal bread, we normally have this really good italian bread baked in our oven and served at the table.  We did not get our delivery, so we had to go out and buy bread"".  I said it was not warm and when we asked our server about it, no answer was given.  The manager said that was odd and that the server should have been able to answer that question.

 We then asked about the Salmon and again, the manager did not know the answer.  So, who is ordering the food???  The server who I would not expect to know the answer unless asked often, went in the back and they did not know the answer and now the manager of the place does not know the answer.  That says a lot about quality in itself.  

Then we told her about the wine glass incident mentioned above and the manager's response, ""she did that, I am really surprised because she has been with us for a long time and is one of our best servers, also she is sometimes the bartender so she should have known better"".

I did not need any other examples as I have seen enough especially if I am being told my server is the BEST they have and there was NO COMPASSION for the customer, just constant justification on behalf of the server, WOW.   Nothing more needs to be said about this place other then they do have OK food and many who don't care about quality will go here, but if you want real NY style Italian food, there is a place in the same shopping center and one a block east at the stop light on the right.

Lastly, the tables have a cloth table cloth with a sheet of paper on top.  The table next to us had a HUGE STAIN on it, which I have a picture of and after the people got up and left, all that was changed was the paper.  The cloth with the LARGE stain stayed on the table.  If this ends up being the only place open, I guess Italian will not be on my menu"
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"This was my first time here and I can only give it 2 stars.  Normally I am sure this is an ok place, it was rated at 4 stars with 103 reviews, however, that does not justify the treatment we received on this night.

We had 5 people in our party and 3 of use decided to take the all you can eat sushi.  We each ordered an appetizer and 3 rolls each.  3x3=9 in most places.  

So, first off the staff was friendly upon arrival and we were seated fairly quickly.  Our drink order was taken pretty fast as well as our order.  The appetizers came pretty quickly, however then the service came to a crawl.  First one roll, then finally another, by the end of an hour we had received 6 rolls.  I only got one of mine, someone else got two of hers and of course the last person got all three of hers.

We continually had to ask for refills on the tea as they were not coming over and checking on us.  They would come by and take the empty plates but would not always ask if we needed anything.  Finally our server came over and asked if there would be anything else?  NOW THE BATTLE BEGAN!!!!

I stated yes, I am still missing two rolls and she is missing one.  The server stated no your are not, I was told you received everything you ordered and I was told your table is done.  I stated that was incorrect and the we were still missing three rolls and named the three we were missing.  She again stated that she was told we received everything we ordered.  NOW WE ARE GOING TO BATTLE.  I ordered three rolls and only got one, DON'T""T TELL ME I ATE THREE WHEN I DID NOT.  She then stated, let me go get your ticket and check.  She came back to the table and proceeded to read the entire ticket to me.

When she was done, I again stated by NAME the three rolls we did not receive.  With a frustrated sigh, she said let go check with the kitchen.  NOW HERE IS MY QUESTION; 

If I am ordering all you can eat, WHY ARE YOU GOING TO DEBATE ME ON HOW MUCH I RECEIVED?  The price is the same if I order one roll or twenty rolls, yes???

A few times through dinner we had to request refills instead of it just being done.  To clarify, they came to the table several times to pick up the empty dishes but would not always check to see if we needed anything.

When I am paying for something, I don't expect to be debated on what I ordered and received.  With several sushi places within a 5 miles radius of this place all offering all you can eat for about the same price, I can get better service without being debated by the staff on what I received and what I did not.  If you are the only person bringing me my food then maybe, but when there were two other people bringing stuff to the table, who the hell are you to debate me on what I received???

In closing the food was decent and does warrant 3 to 4 stars for quality.  We still left an 18% tip, 15% would have been too generous for the way we were treated.  None of the five of us have a desire to return to this place.  Like I said there are several places to choose from within a 5 mile radius of this place with the same quality or better and you will not be harassed by the staff or have to encounter and ugly battle or debate about what you received.  

ALL YOU CAN EAT MEANS, I ORDER IT, YOU HAPPILY BRING IT.  IF I DON'T EAT ALL I ORDERED, THEN YOUR POLICY IS TO CHARGE EXTRA.  NO WHERE IN YOUR POLICY DOES IT STATE YOU WILL DEBATE ME ON WHAT I RECEIVED AND PLACED IN MY MOUTH.  

I came here hungry, I believe I would know if I received and ate three rolls.  Two stars is more then generous for the treatment we received.  The good part, we now know a place we will NOT RETURN TO EVER AGAIN...."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"VEGANS / VEGETARIANS BEWARE!!!!!

PLEASE READ ALL, VERY IMPORTANT...

You ever hear the saying, everything may not be what it seams???  Well, unfortunately that was my experience today at Whole Foods in Henderson on Green Valley.

In the prepared foods counter there were several items that were NOT marked Vegan / Vegetarian, however they were.  There were items marked Vegetarian that were actually Vegan.  In a discussion with the person behind the counter and someone whose name tag said ""Team Leader"", we were told it was the fault of their labeling system.  Well, this is a yes and no answer.  If you take pride in your job and what you do, this would and should be an easy fix, so it is just someone not wanting to go the extra mile to get it right.

NOW, the reason for the ONE STAR.  I am guessing because of the size of this store, the Overall Manager cannot be everywhere and be aware of everything happening in this store.  So they must have department managers or maybe they call them team leaders that report to the manager.  So this means that the team leader/department manager either is not telling the overall manager exactly what is happening within their department or they are not aware of how everything in their department is supposed to be?????

BEYOND MEAT, a VEGAN product which is prepared in some recipe, today being Beyond Meat Buffalo Style.  I asked if this was cooked prior to being mixed with the sauce and placed in the counter.  I was told by the person working behind the counter that YES this product was FLASH Fried before being mixed.  BUT, it was recently found out that the people in the back preparing this food was FLASH FRYING THE BEYOND MEAT PRODUCT IN THE SAME OIL AND FRYER AS ALL THE OTHER MEATS; to which the Team Leader said really with a NON CONCERNED LOOK on their face??????

Now I don't know in the VEGAN / VEGETARIAN WORLD, BUT in the Jewish religion if you are going for something KOSHER and it is mixed with NON KOSHER items, then NO MATTER what you do, IT IS NOT KOSHER.  So, if all VEGAN / VEGETARIAN products in the prepared food area is mixed with NON VEGAN / VEGETARIAN items, on boards meat has touched, or cooked in the same oil / fryer as meats, does it still make it VEGAN / VEGETARIAN???  I would guess NO, that the VEGAN / VEGETARIAN product is NO CONTAMINATED, YET, it is still being sold as a VEGAN / VEGETARIAN item.

Now, everyone does have a choice and with other Whole Foods in the Valley, I will choose to drive the extra miles to one who is not marking items wrong or trying to sell me something that is supposed to be VEGAN but was cooked in the same oil / fryer as meat.  This kind of defeats the purpose of being Vegan / Vegetarian.  

I don't go out of my way to expose stupidity or ignorance, I just happen to find myself in places that divulge this information to me and I feel OBLIGATED to share this with others so they are aware that they are being FALSLY led.  I am sure it is just plain ignorance on the people in the back preparing the items, they are not educated enough to be aware of the fact that EVERYTHING CANNOT be prepared in the same manner, fashion or fryer.  

I don't fault them if they do not live this life style, they maybe were never told.  However, the OVERALL MANAGER should be doing spot checks not to spy on their folks, but to make sure that what they are being told by those department leaders is actually what is happening in the store.  If you run a TIGHT ship and have a system in place to spot check to make sure everything is being done the way it is supposed to, these sort of issues would not happen. 

It is sad that things like this happen and someone has to find out and expose it in order for it to be fixed."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"We were at this place back in Sept and at that time I gave them 4 stars for food and outdoor seating.  I did not say anything in reference to service back then because even though it seemed a little poor, this place was new and only open about a month at the time and wanted to give them the benefit to improve.

Well let me tell you....we sat inside this time as we had a large party and outdoor seating was full.  It was Saturday on a holiday weekend and during happy hour so we expected that now over 2 months later the management would have an idea on how to run this place...I was WRONG!!!  Our drink order was taken and most ordered fountain drinks, I ordered coffee, two people ordered a carafe of sangria and one bottle of beer.  Some food was ordered but more needed to be.

The fountain drinks came quick, the coffee took almost 10 minutes, the sangria 15 and the bottle of beer 20 minutes.  We had to ask for the server to come back and take more orders.  No refills were ever offered.  The problem was the waitress was over worked and the manager provided no relief for her.  There were what appeared to be 2 runners and if you asked them for anything you did not get it, instead they told the waitress who was already struggling.  Then the hostess came by to collect menus and asked if everything was ok, we said no, she laughed took the menus and walked away.  Who's running this place?

A guy who turned out to be the manager walked by, we asked him for another drink and the bill so we did not have to wait another 45 minutes.  He was extremely rude and like the other two guys just told the waitress...one person in the party who originally asked for separate checks was sitting near the computer and when the waitress went to the computer, she asked the server to just give us one bill and we would figure it out; the manager who was standing there with her told her in a very rude tone to get away, he would take care of it and sent her away.

After his rude tones towards the staff and us, he came back over and apologized stating that he was the manager and that he would take care of our bill because the poor service was his fault for short staffing.  He also offered us desert on the house but at this point we just wanted to get out of there.   He did not anticipate the weekend demand and did not have enough staff to cover the place and he would rather cover our bill then us leave unhappy, a little late for that.  

We did not agree with his logic as it not only took money away from the business and the server, there was no just cause for his actions.  We still requested the total of the bill so we could give the server a tip at 20% of the total for her efforts.  She was definitely overbooked and the runners/cleaners, and manager should have helped out instead of listening and taking no action to help other then tell the server and walk away.

The manager is in need of training and the company should take a serious look at his leadership and management skills as he is not only costing the company money but he is also costing people a living because if it were someone else the server would have lost a tip and been left feeling like she failed.  He provided little to no support to her and before I left I made sure to hand her the tip and even though she refused to take it, I insisted because I felt she did her best with what she was given.  She never gave up no matter how bad it got and she deserved a tip for her efforts.

As my last review stated the food was good, there are just some serious leadership and management challenges that if not fixed may cause this place to not be around much longer...I have a degree in business so knowing how a business should run is not just second guessing, it's what I went to college for.  If I can get the same server I would go back as she deserves better recognition then what she is getting from this manager, otherwise, there are other places in Town Square with food in most cases better then what is offered here with MUCH better leadership, management, service and friendliness."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"This was our first visit to Echo & Rig.  What makes this place worth a 5 star rating?  Was our experience flawless?  NO, however there were many factors that made it worth 5 stars & a HIGH RECOMMENDATION for you to try & share your experience.  From the outside you see what appears to be an upscale establishment with a combination of a butcher shop.  You walk in & to the left you will find the hostess stand & beyond that the bar with average seating but limited table seating.  To the right is just that a butcher shop which allows you to look at a variety of meats you will have a choice of upstairs or to take home.  Lets go back outside to where it says on the window, where they proudly display they serve Grass Fed beef,  Free Range Chicken,  Natural, all the key words one likes to hear.

We were greeted by the hostess who took us upstairs to the restaurant area.  As you go up the stairs you cannot help noticing the amazing chandelier & then it opens into a large marble floor area with several tables throughout & a balcony area with several tables.  The balcony was full so we elected to be seated inside.  It is kind of strange but this is Vegas, it can get loud in there like a cafeteria, but the ambiance is high quality even though you see some who respect that & others in shorts & jeans, Vegas...However, once you look at the prices, this is right up there in ambiance with the best of the best on the strip with the exception of the price, it is beyond reasonable.

Xavier the Manager came over & introduced himself as soon as we were seated, introduced himself & welcomed us.  Our server Alpheus was one of the best we have had in this town, personable, knowledgeable & takes a lot of pride in his knowledge of food which he does have.    So lets get down to food....

The menu takes a little time to cover & has a lot of choices.  If you want they will bring you a plate with all the cuts so you can make your choice that way.   We decided to start with the Arugula Salad & the Tomato, cucumber, Watermelon & Red Onion.  The Arugula which came with pear & prociutto was really good but could have used more seasoning or dressing.  It was still very fresh & good.  The Watermelon plate they use a red wine vinegar which was refreshing but it lacked the POP factor.  Adding salt made it better however some fresh balsamic would have put this dish over the top.

We decided to split the Ribeye which at $34 you wonder what you are going to get.  This Ribeye was prepared, seasoned & tasted better then anything else we have had in this town.  What we had, the quality, the taste you will normally pay upwards of $60 or more.  The ability of the butcher shop allow them to serve amazing steaks at an even more amazing price.  I have paid 3 times as much & have not enjoyed it as much as what they have here.

We also ordered Brussel Sprouts, Pistachio & Fresh Lemon, as well as Cauliflower, Chili de Arbol.  The cauliflower was amazing, the Brussel Sprouts lacked flavor.   They were not roasted & soft but had a lot of crunch to them.   The server asked our thoughts on the meal & when we shared we felt they missed the mark on the sprouts, he told us to wait & brought us a side of bacon with a bbq sauce that put the sprouts dish over the top.  This is what it was lacking.

Normally I do not do dessert however our serves felt it necessary to insist we have one on the house since they missed the mark on the sprouts.  He brought a Carmel Turtle Sunday which was out of this world.  Much appreciated but really was not necessary.

Lastly, they have an extensive wine list here but they do not charge a cork fee so if you desire to bring something in with you, they will gladly serve you.  Echo & Rig is amazing and if you have not tried them, give them a try.  If you have tried them & had a bad experience, go back & share your last experience with Xavier, he takes a LOT of pride & personal desire to ensure everyone has an amazing eperience.  You cannot please everyone but he will certainly try.  This is a place we will go back to & bring friends with."
kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,"This is a place we will not give a second chance.  

This place was chosen by my neice for my sisters birthday.  My neice called & told them how many we would be & what time we would arrive.  I was the first to arrive & the lady who met me at the door who also turned out too be our server, my neice was supposed to call back & give her an exact number.  When my neice arrive she again repeated this to which my neice said she did call & tell them a definite number.  Either way, nothing was set up for us & they had to put tables together so we could be seated.

As soon as we sat down we were immediately told they were out of Calamari, Ribs, Veal & something else, REALLY??? Someone obviously does not know how to manage the supply of this place.  The place was not real crowded but there were a few other tables seated.  We watched her run around for a while & finally I asked if I can order a drink.  She said yes, took a few drink orders & left without asking anyone else.  After I got my drink at least 10 minutes passed before she came back & asked everyone else if they wanted a drink.  Drinks were ordered & then some asked for bread.  WELL, we were told bread was $1 a loaf unless we ordered food & then it would come with our dinner, REALLY???

Almost 15 more minutes passed before she came back & asked if we were ready to order.  We ordered our food & our server decided instead of offering us the choice of soup or salad, she would just bring two big salads to the table.  Two people wanted soup instead of salad & this really annoyed our server.  Also some people asked for straws because they were not offered with the drinks to which she went & grabbed a handful & threw them on the table.  NICE TOUCH!!!  The salads came along with the soup but still NO BREAD.  As we were finishing the salad, one person in our party asked if we were going to get bread & she said it was in the oven.  The bread finally came just before the food came out & the next disaster began.  Some of the food was over cooked, some asked for vegetables, no pasta or potatoes & this request was totally ignored.  Supposedly they have a Potato/Broccoli mix, well SURPRISE, they were out of Broccoli so a tiny bit of spinach was substituted with the potatoes that several DID NOT AsK FOR.

The entire night you had to ask for refills as they were not automatic & after the food came out some big guy roaming around looking lost came to our table to ask if everything was ok?  We told him it was as he looked clueless & nothing would be accomplished by telling him anyway.  We watched him walk around & just chat with people at tables never offering to bring more drink or anything.  There were two servers, one seemed to be stuck with all the tables in the place with the other occasionally helping but when asked for more drinks, she brought one out & then went in back & started yelling for our server???  TEAM WORK is not part of this place that is for sure.  

Once all the plates were taken off the table, two plates with cannoli's were brought & literally just dropped on the table with a, ""I decided to just bring the table cannoli's instead of taking desert orders"".  Nothing was offered to my sister for her birthday, no candle nothing.   Finally at the end my sister who I guess has been here been her before asked the two servers who owned this place & what was the issue.  They said one of the owners is still a guy named Tony, but he took 3 or 4 days off for the first time in years.  Well if this place can go to crap with ONE of the owners gone, Tony should consider getting new partners.  The entire experience made you feel like family they had no desire seeing or coming over for dinner.  Even if things were a little shaky with Tony gone, unless Tony is the only one who cooks, there is no excuse for OVERCOOKED  food.  The cooks should cook the same every night.  The clueless guy did come & talk to my wife about her overcooked burnt chicken & after she explained the issue, he said I will take care of this.  They took her dish off our bill.

OH, the BEST PART  OF THE NIGHT, just as we were finishing our dinner food, a table of about 6 came in & sat behind us.  After they ordered they were told that the there was NO MORE CHICKEN, they had run out of CHICKEN???  REALLY???  This is one of the main items on the menu as there are several chicken dishes.  We were told this was a slow period for them & they BLEW IT.. IF the service can be this frightening with 6 or 7 items off the menu because they ran out, the busy high times must really suck for this place.  Then the bill came & 20% was added for tip automatically into the bill.  This was service, food or experience warranting a 10% tip.  They are going to charge you 20% which actually is now against the law or soon to be & charge you for a basket of bread.  This is a place going down hill fast.

First and LAST time coming here for me."
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"It's been awhile since we last came to this location because they were always screwing up our orders. But being that we were babysitting and not in the mood to cook-fast-food became the obvious choice for lunch. Since we had previous issues with missing items or incorrect orders we decided to go in an order. The only special thing I asked was NO SOUR CREAM on the Fully Loaded Nachos, BUT do you think that would get right. 1st I didn't even get the Nachos, and when I did mention it they came out with a huge glob of Sour Cream just staring me in the face. I like so many others am completely reluctant to complain about food and have it redone or sent back in fear of it being defiled or spit on-Who hasn't watched ""Waiting...""? So I just scooped off the SC myself and fed the hungry monsters. The food was all there but it is so disgusting with meat substance they call beef and all the DAMN beans on everything. Who the hell eats Nachos with beans-I always thought it was chips and cheese maybe add some onions,tomatoes and cilantro. All the damn beans make the chips all soggy. Why is it that the taco salad shell is so light & crispy-the best one I've eaten-but they don't use it for their tacos,etc.? I will say it was rather inexpensive $20 for 4 people but it was not Mexican food by any means. I'm not even sure what they meat like substance is they use but it is surely not any kind of beef I've ever made. This location is the same as any other-it's just Taco Bell in general that sucks!!!"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"One of the best places in all of las vegas to eat. a little pr icy for everyday eating but well worth it. There is always a 15-30 minute wait to get in BUT it's worth it. The place is very stylish & comfy with LOTS of HIGH back booths. The Bread they bring is delicious. When you read over the MENU you will notice everything is offered in 1/2 and full sizes. The reason is 1/2 is ENOUGH for any grown man. FULL is just ridiculous. You can feed 3! We started with the bread & ordered some Taquito Shrimp since the table ext to us had & they looked great. They were very tasty-a little like a shrimp Rumaki w/soft crispy shell!! Yummy!

For dinner we had the Chicken Fried Steak-FULL which was thin & crispy with smooth & creamy gravy,the RED mashed potatoes were very garlicky, the veggies were crisp & fresh-cooked al dente.

The Ribs were so tender when you picked it up it ALL fell off the bone. VERY smoky & Rich in BBQ flavor. The beans & cornbread were perfect TOO.

The spaghetti & Meatballs was HUGE. The Meatballs were the size of an apple and very tender & seasoned perfectly. The marinara would be good on anything.

After we packed our to-go boxes we decided we had to try the MOTHER LODE-we have been buying this item in the freezer section for years now & it's $9.99 FRESH TOO!!

You could feel your ass fatten & your teeth start to ROT as you savored every sweet HOT chocolaty bite!

If you are looking to treat someone to an UNFORGETTABLE meal. Go to Claim Jumper's in Henderson or Summerlin. stay ""OFF the STRIP"""
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"It's not like I needed any persuasion to come here but KOMP 92.3 was giving away FREE bbq, NHRA race tickets, a $3K bbq grill ,concert,movie and comedy tickets plus  lots more.

Entering the shopping center here you can smell the bbq and damn was I hungry. After signing up for the drawing I had to get a full meal.
Even though they had a feast at their tent you could grub from. I wanted my own!!

Suprisingly there was no wait to be seated and we got the table right next to the fireplace.

My son & I decided on the 3 meat combo w/St Louis Ribs,Beef Brisket & Chopped pork. 2 sides come with it so we got their incredible Wilbur Beans & Drunkin Apples. Plus 2 drinks $21!!

The service here is great, fast & friendly very helpful and quite entertaining too.

So, no suprise the food came out quickly---

The chopped pork is the BEST! Smoky,crunchy and so tender & moist. The ribs are great but I like mine dry-rubbed no sauce. The brisket is great but has no crunch and they sauced it too.

The sides here are incredible bbq eats. The Wilbur beans are so good with brisket & chopped link in it. The drunkin apples are quite a delight too. Amaretto sauce over tender sliced apples sprinkled with cinnamon.

The meal was great-no doggie bag needed here. The service was fun & friendly and the whole atmosphere takes you back to the county fair & bbq cook-offs. The trophies are impressive but the fact the nail it every time out is more impressive. I have tried over 40 bbq place s in Vegas and I still say Dave's is the BEST  !!"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"While at Winterfest in Henderson we visited the Marie Callendar's booth and purchased a pie knife for $1.00 and they gave us a handful of coupons some for $5 per person off lunch, a free pie or Buy 1 ENTREE get 1 Free. SO we decided it had been long enough since we had tried this place none of the same people could possibly still work here.
I ordered over the phone for pickup-Pepper-Crusted Hand-Carved Tri-Tip*Seared medium rare and hand-carved in a cabernet beef reduction. Served with loaded mashed potatoes topped with cheese, crispy bacon and green onions a skewer of jumbo Cajun shrimp
HOMESTYLE BEEF STROGANOFF 
Tender chunks of beef, slow-simmered with fresh mushrooms in a demi-glace red wine beef sauce, finished with caramelized onions and a hint of Grey Poupon Dijon™. Served over fettuccine noodles with a dollop of sour cream
And to top it all off -Blueberry Pie - Fresh Blueberries enhanced with flavorful apples baked in a double crust pie.
The stroganoff was great but could have used more than a dollop of sour cream, some of the noodles were stuck together too, but good meat needed a little more sauce.
The cornbread was nice and moist and good to the last crumb.
The tri-tip may be the most tender & juicy piece of meat I have ever had cross these teeth. The veggies were nice & crisp and the loaded potato was an entire meal in itself.
This time around it was a much better experience , the most important thing the food was great. The meat was cooked to perfection and everything was hot & fresh. Very good for takeout. The coupon was worth $14 off, what a deal!!!."
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"I had another BBQ attack & decided to find a new place to try in the neighborhood. After a little searching I found Longhorn's BBQ on N. Rancho.

After a little looking around I found it in a little strip mall but it had just closed up at 8pm. Damn it.

Still hankering for some BBQ I recalled Buzz BBQ being somewhere of the 95 Hwy in this area and went off in search of some BBQ.

Buzz BBQ was voted #1 BBQ joint in Las Vegas 2008 and there business is proudly displaying all their new banners and even had it painted on the front doors.

It is not a small place-it actually a regualr size restaurant with lots of boothes and flat screen tv's for the sports fans. Most of the decor is Western.

The hostess was very friendly and helpful describing all the different meats and her favorites. We settled on a 3meat family meal with 2 sides & rolls. I ordered ribs(3), beef brisket and chopped pork with mac-n-cheese  & baked beans plus rolls.

We only waited 5 minutes and it was ready to go. The damage $20!

All the meats were very moist & quite smoky but not overpowering. You could not really taste any rub but it was decent meat.The ribs were large and tender but a little fatty. The chopped pork was the best thing but it had no crunchy pork skin in it. The brisket was very tender but really fatty too.  The sauce was sweet but came on the side.

 The mac-n-cheese wasnt very good and the baked beans were canned. 

Overall it was a little disappointing considering it's suppossedly the BEST. 

For the same 3 meat 2 side combo I could have got it at CJ's for $12.99 & it was alot better there."
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"Best Memorial day weekend Event

This Friday and Saturday, May 22-23, 2009.

If you aren't here you are really missing out. 

Located at the  Park in downtown Boulder City this annual events hosts dozens of bbq vendors,live entertainment and a great atmosphere for the whole family.

This is a serious BBQ competition with the BEST in the SW coming out to compete. 

If you wanna eat RIBS you better come early because they go QUICK.@7pm last night there was already a 30-45 minute wait.

Best Brisket was @ Big T's-smoky,crunchy and chopped.

Longest line was at OTH BBQ, it was $1 cheaper than the rest. 

Papa's Smokehouse was great with sliced brisket. Fast line and  great service. The brisket was great and the roll it was on was out of thsi world. Great sides too.

Whiskey Ranch had the largest display and was steadily busyThey had run out of ribs by 6pm.

Sooooo..I had  the pork which was sweet and smoky, with real good bbq sauce available.  I wanted to go back just for the beans they were so good, smoky sweet with bacon in them.

There are Dozens more vendors and they also have chicken & kabobs and of course hamburgers & hotdogs. 

Prices are fairly reasonable-Most all sandwiches are $8-come with sides & drink, Ribs$10, you can get the burger & hotdogs w/drink for $6

About 20 picnic tables so seating is limited but your welcome to bring lawn chairs,blankets and coolers too.

No carnival rides but the park has a great playground and open area to play.

Only 2 short days with one already passed so you better grab some chairs,a  blanket and head out early to grab some bbq. Have a great time!"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"This was my 3rd time here. Another food trip inspired by a restaurant.com $25 gift certificate.

We arrived at 7pm Friday night and the parking lot was fairly full but once we entered the dining room was empty-everyone was in the bar.

We asked to sit upstairs in the game room and it was empty to. We had it all to ourselves....or so we thought.

They have 2 pool tables,fooseball,pinball, racing,hunting and a jukebox plus a big screen with 3 couches to lounge and a 100""+ projection screen for events,etc.

There's also a small bar upstairs but the waitresses do have to run up & down the stairs for soft drinks & food.

We ordered drinks & some cheeseburger sliders for an appetizer. Then we all ordered sandwiches and a steak.

My son got the Teriyaki Swiss burger with fries, my wife got the Turkey Bacon Club and I got the  Mustang Melt-an 8oz New York with bleu cheese and bacon bits.

Before the food arrived a group of 10-12 kids and their parents arrived to add some life to the place. The kids were all well-behaved and excitedly enjoying all the games.

The service was great, the food however was just ok. The hamburger taste like frozen patties flavorless & dry -not at all good. The turkey club was great and the steak was enjoyable but the bleu cheese & bacon wasn't necessary the steak would have been better without it.

I was a little disappointed they didn't have the california-style  tuna melt that used to be on the menu (http://www.menusearch.net/lasvegas/restaurant.php?name=570)

I will buy another GC @ restaurant.com but I will stay away from the burgers and stick to the pork tenderloin."
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"This was my 1st trip to @BlkMtnGrill. It's A lodge-like bar & grill with seperate dining room the kitchen is open in the dining room so you can see your meal being made. Really Cool:)

After taking a minute to clean up and check the place out-which if you are a hunter you will love it. Very cozy with a fireplace front & center big comfy seats and lots of great decor;-)

Since we arrived just before 11- we could order breakfast or lunch and decided to do BOTH.

We started off with the cheese plate(cheese & fruit really)-then ordered a 3 item omelette with ham,bacon & cheddar-potaotes & english muffin-also a burger with grilled mushrooms and french fries.

(NOTE: Drinks-they serve PEPSI)

Service was OUTSTANDING-our drinks were filled quickly and the food was brought out in a timely manner.

When the food arrived we knew immediately we were in way over our heads-it was ALOT of food!!

The burger was good a little-bit over cooked, the fries were great.

The omelette was insane-the was a whole hog in there soooo much ham & bacon:) maybe a little too heavy on the cheese but that was an easy fix:) I like shredded potao hashbrowns myself but the kids loved the country potaotes!!

The cheese plate was fantastic with strawberrys,granny smith apples,grapes and raspberries and several different cheeses-my favorite was the smoky cheddar-yummy:)

Yeah I know I only tried the bar food but it was damn good.

They serve a much more sophisticated menu than the items I ordered so I'm gonna have to go back some Tuesday evening (2 for 1) and try their dinners. Maybe the Stuffed Alaskan Halibut of Petite Beef Wellington;)"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"we don't usually go out for dinner at a bar and we don't usually go out on a wednesday night but we received a $10 off $20 purchase & a free pitcher of beer coupons from timber's bar & grill in our weekly mailings. so without having to put much thought into that bargain we loaded up & headed to the nearest location. flamingo & durango on the west side.  we arrived fairly early about 7pm and the parking lot was nearly full so we figured there may be a little wait but when we entered it was seat yourself and plenty of boothes & tables plus the bar was huge. the whole place has a log cabin feel minus the animal heads typically hanging on the wall. the bar had a lounge area & tv's all above the bar, gaming at the bar & a couple arcade games. it was a very cozy bar.
well we sat in a booth and ordered a pitcher of beer & 10 wings to get started. wednesdays they have $0.35 wings til 11pm. the beer was super-cold with polar pitcher. the wings were hot & meaty. we also order the beef brisket sliders, the catfish dinner & a pot roast melt sandwich & fries. all the food was great & so were the leftovers the next day. the pot roast sandwich was the best i've had. the catfish was damn good and the sliders were great too. this place has a good menu, some very reasonable prices, a little short on help right now, maybe they're trying to work understaffed. things take a little while here but it is worth the wait, heck i wait longer to get in to places than i spent here. i think this could be a real fun bar to hang out, but i really recommend the food & cheap beer-the people are great too. this all cost  me less than $30 !!"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"Fantastic Barbecue!!!! I've waited an entire year to come back to this event and eat at this bbq stand!!! Some of the BEST BBQ anywhere!!!

I of course opted for the 3 meat & 3 side meal getting Ribs,Pulled Pork,Brisket plus baked macaroni and cheese and macaroni & potato salads. 3+3=$16 well worth it.

Bottled water & Canned Soda were only $1 too!!! The food is ordered at one end and served at another to keep it moving-other vendors have 30+ minute wait because of their disorganized service.

Immediately upon opening my order I noticed I had been given a leg & thigh of bbq chicken and NO pulled pork or Macaroni and Cheese. When I went back to explain they graciously provided me the missing items. and I ended up with an extra piece of chicken. Fair enough for the inconvenience;)

The food was really good. Perfectly cooked barbecue. The ribs falling of the bone tender and moist with a great bbq sauce on the side. The brisket -some of BEST ever!! Tender melt in your mouth sliced paper thin!! The chicken was smoked through but moist and tender plus it had a little kick to it. The Pulled pork was great but was already sauced(personally I prefer adding my own) The macaroni & potato salads were homemade and pretty good but the baked macaroni and cheese was a little overdone and mushy with no crunchy topping to indicate it being BAKED mac n chz and no real cheese flavor.

John Mulls Meats operates a butcher shop in NW Las Vegas and does event catering but this event is the ONLY time they come out during the year so get down to FREMONT and check them out before it's too late. Taste & Sounds of Soul goes on through February 21st!!!"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"I had come to expect good quality from this place but this time around found it very disappointing.

The price was right-2 comped buffets. The service was great, quick to take the plates on top of the drink refills and extra napkins.

The salad & soup bar was great. Bleu Cheese Chunks for the salad and great chicken noodle soup with tender white meat chicken.

They have lots of sushi, fried sushi, wontons,potstickers,dim sum and lots of aian cuisine.Most of it is very weak with little pop to it.

The beef brisket was tender & juicy  and had a nice smoky flavor. The Roast Beef was a little uhhh..No seasoning on the meats.

The cornish game hens were super juicy and very good.The fried chicken however was tough and dried out.

Most of the side dishes like mac n cheese, beans,potato salad, coleslaw, and collard greens were just bland its like its all the same food with no fllavor.

The pizza was doughy and the vegtables and meats were not cooked. The whole Italian section of ravioli,rotini and spaghetti is all pretty weak. Dinner they usually do made to order pasta with shrimp etc.

The desserts were pretty dry & crusty with a very limited selection.Real diappointing.

There's lots of other things available but I did not try tham because they didn't even look appealing. 

I see there is quite a varied opinion on this place and I would say 6 months ago the food was 4x better now it just seems like all the same quality as other station bufffets, one of which I tried just yesterday at the Palace Station. 

Same tasting food. Red Rock had better presentation plus a little more selection.

For my money I'm sticking to the Palms-filet mignon & crab legs"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"John Mull's Meats also does BBQ catering under Road KIll Grill. 2008 Taste & Sounds of Soul Winner.

I ventured downtown to the Taste & Sounds of Soul Friday & Saturday to indulge in some good bbq and soul food.

Friday night was a packed house with long lines and a huge crowd enjoying the entertainment on the main stage at Fitzgerald's.

I walked up & down the tent area of vendors and there was about 8-10 food vendors serving bbw,asian,seafood gumbo,turkey legs,giant cajun shrimp,fried catfish,shrimp and hushpuppies,funnel cakes and lots of pies and cakes.

The lines were outrageous. H&H Bar-B-Q with a big red smoker trailer had a line of 50+ people about 75 yards long the longest by far.

Phat Katz BBQ had 30-40 people waiting. Usually long lines and full parking lots are a sign of excellent food, service,etc.

This would not be the case here.

Road Kill Grill was the 1st stand in the food court and the line was short because it moved rapidly.
I had the 5-bonz/w tips rib dinner w/2 sides for $10-I had mac n cheese and macaroni salad. I also ordered 2 sandwiches-a pulled pork and a beef brisket. SOdas were $1.

The ribs were rub no sauce. Nice smoky taste very tender and very meaty. the tips were the best. juicy and oh so yummy.

The mac n cheese was better than I've found at any storefront BBq and the macaroni salad was great too.

The pork sandwich was great, sauce had a little zip and the bread was very fresh and quite remarkable.

The beef brisket was some of the best I've had could've used a little crust & rub but very juicy & tender. Sauce on the side.

I wish they had a stand at Lowe's or Home Depot or something because this guy knows his BBQ."
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"New Mediterrean Menu and classics like their Twice Baked Lasagna are BACK!!! @MacaroniGrill 

Rolling solo I decided to sit in the bar and watch the game, drin k a beer and grab a little something to eat. This place is a little fancy but very inviting and all the servers from the hostess to the waitress to the bartender to the manager are FANTASTIC!!

I decided to order some Tomato Bruschetta with  grilled, rustic focaccia bread and also Lasagna Al Forno-Twice baked lasagna layered with authentic Bolognese meat sauce, ricotta and mozzarella. Topped with imported Italian tomato sauce, mozzarella and basil.

After just a few moments the bartender came back with my beer and a platter of Prosciutto e Parmigiano-(Imported Italian prosciutto and aged Parmigiano Reggiano served with fig jam) AND a  COMPLIMENTARY hot loaf w/olive oil and fresh ground black pepper.

Watching the game drinking a beer and eating some bread with proscuitto,cheese,and olive oil I was loving life waiting on my appetizer and entree to come out thinking I ordered WAY too much food NOT knowing they brought all this out for each table-for a family YES but one guy in the bar-I thought I was getting the VIP treatment. I mean that FIG JAM was outstanding!!!

After about 10 minutes the bartender refilled my beer and brought out my Lasagna with extra sauce!! At that moment it hit me-I said Brushetta he heard Prosciutto?!?! I wasn't gonna be seeing any tomatoes tonight ...

BUT no biggie the proscuitto platter was GREAT and the Lasagna was WOW!! I can't believe they took this off the menu at one time?!?

I need to find out if they have a happy hour!! Loving this place again even though they screwed up my order:)"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"I guess I should have known a new location wasn't gonna change anything.

I had even been warned by my fellow co-workers that had already eaten here...BUT

I had to try it myself...it's BBQ and it's in my office building..there such huge potential upside.

They told me it was small,pricy and just OK.

Well I stopped in after work This place is attached to the Sand Dollar Lounge a blues bar next door, so Harry's has no restrooms but for some reason it still has the smell.

I still stayed and I got the Beef Brisket with 2 sides for $10.95 and 2 catfish tacos for $5.95

I was the only customer but they were making it fresh so it was gonna be 15 minutes.I wandered around and checked out the small dine-in area they had a jukebox and vinyl records & autographed photos of soul legends everywhere.

The waitress was real friendly when she had to break it to us they were out of cilantro & onion for the tacos so they would be dry as a bone. no tartar or lemon offered, just some sour-looking  salsa.

The beef brisket was actually as little as a school lunch sandwich with a ice cream scoop of mac n cheese on the side and 5 hushpuppies.

The mac n cheese looked strange from the go, but after tasting it I had to spit it out. Dry, gritty like sand and where is the cheese?? Stay away from the mac!! You have been warned.

The brisket was more like pot roast smothered in super sweet and watery sauce. Not my kind of BBQ.

The hushpuppies were good-crispy but soft and flavorful in the milddle.

The catfish was dirty tasting and kinda rubbery. I didn't eat them all & I wouldn't try them again. I hate dirt tasting fish.

I should have listened....pricy($28.95 full rack ribs),small portions and nothing special about it BBQ."
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"love the 50's style feel with the pie counter & cabinet


high back boothes with formica table tops


very clean & comfortable
waitress, hostess and drink guy were friendly enough but once we placed our order they were seldom seen.


menu was extensive but no pasta & they were out of rolls & ribs


drinks were a little slow coming


seemed a little under staffed
greek fries were crispy and very flavorful(italian seasoned) & cucumber dressing was cool & smooth not too overpowering

salads were fresh & crispy with blue cheese crumbles in the bleu cheese

biscuits were a little dry & not enough gravy-bacon was way way greasy-too much to even eat

prime rib was incredible-spiced just right-(lots of pepper) -melted into strands when soaked in the au jus. baked potato was hot & cooked all through

porterhouse was cooked perfectly med-very tender melted in your mouth-charring was done to perfection & made the steak that much better. veggies( julienne sliced carrots & broccoli were steamed & ok)potato was good but plain-no salt

banana cream pie was good-very little banana-but cream & ala mode were very smooth and sweet.

they had coke & mr. pibb, the iced tea was a little watered down.

this diner looks great with the modern spin on 50's diners and the enormous pie cases right in the door. the menu includes breakfast, lunch and dinner. mexican & american continental. over 40 differents cakes & pies. the service is a little slow-more worried about the big tables. the food is pretty good -the size of the prime rib is unforgettable-melissa will be up @ 3 a.m. with the ""meat sweats"" after that feast.

they have great steak specials-under $8 for steak & shrimp and of course steak sandwich & steak and eggs too.

3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"Grand Opening!!!

Located at the Las Vegas Outlet Center right between Buffalo Wild Wings & Dunkin Donuts this place has finally opened. Yah!!!!

I had been waiting for this place to open ever since I recieved their email newsletter telling me about this NEW Vegas location.

I knew from checking out their website that it wasn't ""smoked"" bbq-they give instructions on how to bake them low & slow.

So I had low expectations but it's BBQ it's NEW and that's really all it takes to get me in the door.

The place was fairly busy with quite a large staff prepared to handle any rush. The mgmt was busy cleaning,greeting and making sure everyone was satisfied. Very friendly people.-The manager told me the lunch crowd was out the door & around the corner!!

I was already starving having just got off of work so I went big and ordered a 3 meat plate with 2 sides & a roll. I got the beef brisket,pulled pork & pork ribs-$12 plus a Big Yellow Cup $2.

The place smelled great so I was hoping the bbq would be as good and I was not at all disappointed.

The meats were very tender & moist, fall-off the bone ribs and the sauce was sweet but had a little something to it I can't describe but it was pretty good. Kinda Caroilna-style.

The baked potato casserole was an unusual yet delightful side and the mac n cheese was really mini shells & cheese and was nothing special it was NOT baked and kinda plain.

Everyone in the place seemed to be enjoying themselves and the FREE ice cream was quite a hit, the BBQ was better than average, the sides ok, but the rolls were fantastic & it was super-FAST!

They pride themselves on being a fast-food bbq stand. So for fast-food it totally rocks, for Vegas BBQ its better than average for a chain-store BBQ.

Bring your kids in on Sundays to eat for FREE(12 & under)!!
FREE ice cream all the time.
Check it out!"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"located inside a very dark & smoky bar it's actually quite unique. private boothes, and lots of seating, movie poster in every booth depict ""kilroy"" in each poster from godfather to the matrix to get shorty. very clean but very dead for dinner hours. less than 10 customers
i'm not sure you can say there was any service. there was 4 waitresses chatting amongst them selves. they did bring us menus,our food & drinks but they never bothered to ask how everything was & when she cme to bring the check instead of asking why there was a whole burger patty on the plate (if anything was wring with it) she simply asked if a doggy-bag was needed-heck no!!!
burgers,fries and coleslaw that's all we asked for. the burgers were a little undercooked for some, the fries were crispy & salty(like old-skool mcd's fries) the cole slaw wasn't sweet but was rather good & fresh. there wasn't anything really special about the burgers-they weren't even charbroiled or anything-very greasy & who really eats a poung of ""canned"" mushrooms on 1/2 pound burger. the buns & sourdough were soggy because of the grease.
kilroy's bar-restaurant was once known for what the food network called the ""best hamburger in las vegas"" 

they must have visited back before the ""smoking ban"" and you couldn't taste the food. really nothing special-you think for a dive restaurant to survive in a dead bar you'd have to have great food but apparently not here. the service was terrible-our waitress actually disappeared half way through dinner & we had to track her down for the check. servers were too busy being bored & gossiping.

the atmosphere in the diner was really cool but wasn't enough to save the day. 

the menu was very limited & prices were high for the quality & quantity provided. there are way better places in town.

3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"This was my 1st trip to #Landry's even though I have lived in the neighborhood for years!! Im just NOT a big seafood fan. But I heard word they had great steaks & burgers plus Happy Hour specials.Soooooo...

Here we are on a Wednesday night around 8pm -pretty light crowd but the place looks like its trying to hard to be  ritzy for a chain steak & seafood place-you know formal but jeans are ok.

There's a bar off to the side and a small lobster tank with 2 pathetic looking lobsters right as you enter the dining room. Boothes line the wall and small 4 chair table fill the room.

We were seated immediately in a booth and after about 10 minutes our waiter-#Jacob arrived to take our drink order. We went ahead and place our entire order since we were hungry & thirsty!!!

We decided to try their spin on a traditional app-Crab,Spinach& Artichoke dip and then the wife ordered the CRAB FEAST with a little of everything crab-Legs,Balls,Cakes and more. and I ordered the 12 oz Ribeye and Baked Potato.

The food came out alot faster than the 1st appearance-1st they brought a house salad with house dressing and the dip came out quick too.The dip was great-not fishy as I had feared but rather rich and creamy not unlike regular SPinach & artichoke dip. 

The main course was FANTASTIC!! One of the best under $50 steaks I've ever had(actually ONLY $22) cooked perfectly mediem-rare seasoned well and smooth like butter:) You could literally cut it with a SPOON:)

The crab was less than impressive. ONLY 2 crab legs for $40!!! WTF!~!!! The Fried Crab Balls were awful-too much cornmeal or whatever and no flavor. The crab cake the same and the Au Gratin Crab Meat was just whack-Where's the CRAB,huh? Definitely a better deal to get a STEAM POT at Joe's Crab Shack or the Krazy Buffet all-you-can-eat crab for $15.

I will definitely go back for a steak or $5 sliders at Happy Hour but as far as SEAFOOD goes I'll pass."

The ad had their menu printed on the back and the sandwiches all sounded quite appetizing and a little different variation than you see in most sub shops in Las Vegas.

My 1st attempt at coming here I show up at 10:30 on a Sunday and they didn't open until 1 am so I went elsewhere.

This time it was 4 pm on a Friday and I was hungry so I ordered 3 sandwiches to go. A Beef Dip,A BBQ Beef and a Pastrami Nami. 

The cashier was fantastic-very helpful,perky and informative. She said they were owned by Timbers Gaming and had been open since June 2009. Not on twitter yet but a TV commercial airing soon.

The sandwiches are a little pricy $7-8 each -one size fits all.(smaller than a footlong bigger than a size inch)-one type of bread.

The 1st sandwich was the beef dip. Thin roast beef , horseradish and onion. The beef was ok but not real impressive and this was the BEST of the 3 sandwiches.

The 2nd sandwich was the BBQ Beef-same beef as the french dip slathered in bad bbq sauce and some onions thrown in. Nothing memorable here.

The 3rd sandwich was the pastrami-It sure looked good-lots of pastrami-I only made it through half and had the WORST heartburn. It seemed like it had a TON of pepper. Too thin pastrami and it was a little dry and chewy not moist and tender like GOOD pastrami is.

Overall the employees were very enthusiastic, the place had a real cool surfer vibe to it and a simple menu but it's a little too expensive and not impressive at all.

It's nice to see a new place popping up in this economy but I do not have alot of hope for this place -especially this location. 

MOST of the customers will be college kids looking to eat cheap and Port Of Subs is nearby."
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"After much hype from the Man Vs Food episode with Adam Richman, Hash House A Go Go  opened a 2nd location at the Imperial Palace on the STRIP.

HHAGG is known for their Enormous portions of farm fresh food with a twist and we have been to the Sahara location several times including the Man v Food shooting so we were hoping to see the SAME food,service and atmosphere as the original.

The entry/waiting area has a wall of photographs of celebrities who have visited. The dining room is typical with boothes along the walls and tables filling in between. A few TV's i n the center hanging from the the ceiling a small bar along one wall.

When we arrived there was NO line so we were seated immediately but don't surprised if you have to wait 30-45 minutes when it gets busy. This place is well staffed so they keep it moving.

We ordered drinks-coffee and soda then our meal-I got the fried pork tenderloin sandwich & fries and My son @milesdavisvegas got the Farmer's Daughter-French Toast w/bacon & eggs.

It took awhile for the food to come out -I had 3 cups of coffee waiting but the place really got busy after we arrived and Our waiter was NEW,actually his 1st day on the job.

The pork tenderloin was FANTAsTIC-thin & crispy-pickles onion and ketchup!!

The french toast was great-thick cinnamony with strawberries and banana,the bacon was crisp and the eggs cooked PERFECTLY over-easy lots of yolk no runny whites!!

I'm a little biased towards this place because its 1/2 places in Las Vegas that serve a tenderloin sandwich so I don't really explore the menu -just burgers,breakfast & the tenderloin BUT I see lots of people trying the chicken & waffles really killin them:)

I see the Reviews on YELP really rip this location but that wasn't my experience. The service was good, the food was good and it has the same feel as the original location minus the long wait.

My only knock on this place is the prices but that's just me-because-I mean the biggest thing about a midwest menu is that it's  simple & CHEAP!!!"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"great decor, like a texas bbq, old country theme but with big screen tv's 2 on every wall, nice comfy boothes in the dinig area and tall bar table & chairs in the bar area. only thing missing was sawdust on the floor & some live country music!!


this place is brand new been open approx. 2 weeks now! looks great
very friendly & efficient. everything was brought out timely,drinks were always filled quickly, the coleslaw tasted diiferent than expected & was promptly switched out very professionally. owners came to the table to make sure everything was good.very good waitstaff-attractive & friendly-great for college location
fried pickles were good -if you like them. a different spin than the fried pickle chips i've had before but good



the spinach & artichoke dip was made fresh and very hot & yummy-the pita bread was grilled & great- just wish there was more!! 



but the chips did the job-we ate every last bite. 



we had 3 types of ribs (rib tasting)



the beef rib was huge but not very meaty & dry 



the baby backs were small but very tasty 



the spareribs were the meatiest and very tasty too 



the beans were good but didn't have any chopped brisket or links in it, 



the cole slaw as stated was a little different it was made champagne vinegar & gave it a little tequila flavor. 



the cornbread muffin were good but just average.



the mac & cheese was good & cheesy but not baked
all the reviews claimed it to be the best rib place in all of las vegas.



and while we did really enjoy this place. it had everything you wanted in a bbq joint the look & feel , reasonable prices, terrfic service & the owners were on hand.



but it fell a little short with the bbq. 



don't get me wrong it was good but being a ma & pa place you really expect them to be so much better than the chain places.



the waitress even told us the cook was not the best-so we expect better results next time.



this place is located across from unlv so it's open late til 2am & they have great drink specials & that fried pbj & banana/honey sandwich i gotta go back for later !!!"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"After checking Google for the  best breakfast in Las Vegas I found this place-Jamm's listed as one them I had not yet visited.

I checked out the reviews on Yelp (it had 4 stars on 8 reviews) & Urbanspoon* their menu on the website looked good an was very cheap. 

So we loaded up and headed out nice and early to beat  the before & after church crowd you sometimes find in a breakfast spot. 

Surprisingly the place had no wait but was very busy. It's a small diner with a 5-seat counter and very open floor plan with boothes along the walls. Very small-town mid-western.We were seated immediately in a very large booth which is nice so there's plenty of elbow room, we have a lefty.


We ordered drinks right away-cofffee & water and then the waitress took our orders, she was very pleasant and efficient. We did notice right away that the menu prices were about 25% higher than stated on the website, kinda disappointing, BUT anyways, 

I ordered the Big Breakfast which was 1/2 ham steaK, 2 bacon,2 sausage links and 2 eggs plus 2 pancakes, my son got a full order of 2 biscuits & gravy and my wife ordered 2 eggs with country fries. 

The food came out timely and looked delicious. All well cooked-the meat slighty crisp and the egg cooked perfectly OVER-MEdium, something you find rarely done right.

The biscuits were huge and the gravy was good but very little pepper and very little sausage. 

The bacon was crispy and the sausage had snap. 

The pancakes were a little dry and the whipped butter was like pure oil. 

The country fries were cooked well done with lots of onions & peppers. 

The coffee was a little weak but then again we like it strong so maybe its just right for most people. 

The service was great for us but in the table next to us it was exact opposite.

 A couple with 2 kids was ordering and they were told there was no avocado so they couldn't get what they wanted, then they got the wrong stuff when their food came out, they were loudly voicing their displeasure. 

The place is a little drafty and there is no TV to watch the football game,ETC but they do have the newspaper & Sunday comics plus the food is great & the service is TITS!! 

I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good regular breakfast spot."
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"I decided to take my wife to @CaboWaboLV for an early Valentine's dinner since she is the biggest @Sammy_Hagar fan & has been dying to check this place out since it opened. 

Before going I did my homework and read all the reviews that had been posted. After reading I was really surprised this place is still OPEN. Not too many good things being said. 

We arrived on Friday night around 10pm and the house band had just started playing. Acoustic Soul-Las Vegas' Original & Only LIVE Jukebox. They play all requests-some good some NOT so good. 

We were seated immediately with no wait even though the place was packed including the outdoor patio bar. 

The menu is mexican food with a baja twist. VERY Pricey. We ordered Beef Fajita Nachos to start-The Carne Asada Entree & a 3 item combo with Hard & Soft shell tacos and a cheese enchilada. Ice Water all around. NO drinks this time:) 

(However they did pour FREE shots of tequila when the band played ""Mas' Tequila"") 

The service was a little slow it took nearly 30 minutes before we saw the appetizers and we spent most of the night chewing on ice. 

The nachos were very underwhelming-10-12 soggy chips covered in cheap shredded cheese and sparse bits of beef fajita meat. 4 melonballer size scoops of (lettuce,pico,sour cream & guac) NO seasoning, no spice, no flavor just cheese. The complimentary chips & salsa are a much better choice. 

NEXT, the entrees came out- The carne asada plate covered w/cheese, onions and jalapenos. a couple tortillas and a plate with (lettuce,pico,sour cream & guac). NO salsa!! Again with the cheap shredded cheese and the jalapenos were not even cooked just sliced and covered in cheese. 

The fajita onions & peppers were way too much compared to the skimpy 8oz carne asada steak. The steak like the nachos had NO seasoning or flavor. FOR $20 at a bar I was really expecting something phenomenal. 

The 3 item combo of beef tacos and cheese enchilada was alright except for the cheese enchilada which again used the cheap shredded cheese which didnt melt well at all and was tasteless. 


The lack of seasoning for a mexican resataurant is really unacceptable and NO salsa with entrees no beans with the chips appetizer. :( 


For 2 people to have an appetizer and 2 entrees-drink ice water and get slow service for $65 pretty disappointing to say the least:("
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"@FireflyLV on Paradise has long been known as an OFF the STRIP hotspot with hundreds of reviews,photos and news articles about it. 

Recently they opened a 2nd location at the Plaza in downtown Las Vegas and it has received an ever BETTER reception if that is possible. The view downtown seems to be all the rave:) 

My visit was around 7pm on a Thursday night since I've seen the crowds here on the weekend I wanted to avoid a long wait and I was delighted to be seated immediately. The place was packed and everyone seemed to be having a great time eating & drinking. 

We ordered filet mignon sliders, fries, some lamb chops and the waitress recommended the bacon wrapped dates!!! No drinks this time 

The menu has a nice selection of tapas all priced very reasonably and the food is presented like those other higher priced chic places;) 

The food was incredible, the dates are fantastic, wrapped in bacon with crumbled bleu cheese in a red wine reduction. Soooooo Good I had 2 orders:) 

The lamb chops were great, cooked perfectly medium-rare in a nice wine reduction sauce with julienned veggies and capers. Really I could have ate 10-12 of the lamb chops and been good. 


The sliders I didn't like the cheese sauce I could have done without-maybe some dijon mustard instead-the filet mignon burger didnt seem any different than any other sliders Ive had. I like the crispy onion straws but I'll skip the sliders next time. 

The fries were good-nothing spectacular just fries with grated cheese. I'd like to see some truffle fries or something;) 

The dessert was outlandish-Chocolate and cherry bread pudding[warm w/port wine reduction, vanilla ice cream] -I could have ate another one. 

It was a TOUGH choice between the bread pudding and the Banana-Nutella sandwiches[w/Nutella cream dipping sauce] which the table next to us was enjoying:) 

My overall experience was fantastic the service was fast,friendly and quite helpful. The food was good. The atmosphere was fun & comfortable. When I left iasked the hostess if I could present the manager with something 

She looked at me a little strange but came back with the manager who was quite pleasant and accepted the TOP RATED RESTAURANT(#3) on Urbanspoon I gave him-telling me it would be given to the right person. 

UPDATE: To my pleasant surprise it has been placed in the menu marquee right outside the front door:)"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"Special thanks to Chef Rodriguez for his gracious hosptality and most wonderful meal. @Vic_n_Anthonys steakhouse located in downtown #Vegas' newly renovated Gold tower at the @GoldenNuggetLV Hotel & Casino 

We had a reservation for 7pm and were seated immediately. The dining room was very elegant with beautiful stained glass ceiling, formal settings with low mood lighting. 

The waiter came out promptly introducing himself and welcoming us with a full description of the evenings menu and specials that were currently being offered. The evenings specials were the Lobster live from the tanks and Kobe steak heated to liking on a hot salt tablet prepared tableside VERY COOL!! 

We ordered drinks a couple apps and a steak dinner and a couple desserts. 

The apps came out quickly-a crab cake like NO other. light and crispy full of crab covered in crab with a sauce I'm not sophisticated enough to describe but the fact I DO NOT eat seafood and I licked the plate clean here says it ALL!! WOW!! 

The other appetizer Maple Glazed Quail was alot like chicken drumettes but lighter tastier with a wonderful combination of greens+tomatoes with another indesribeable sauce:) YUM 

What a way to get started!!! We could hardly wait to try the steak. 16oz prime strip cooked medium-rare:) and of course a baked potato loaded with butter&sour cream!! Thats me Mr Meat & Potatoes;) 

BEST STEAK EVER!!! I have only been to a handful of places that even offer steaks costing more than $20 so I have limited experience here but this was by far and away the best steak I have EVER had. Melt in your mouth delicious!! Oh and the potato wasn't bad either lol :) 

After this amazing meal -Chef Rodriguez came out to thank us for coming in and then we talked about his visits to some of the #Vegas restaurants he had visited during his stay concluding there's so much to discover and it's such a fun and tasty adventure. 

To our surprise the Chef presented us dessert--Cheesecake with blueberries and sauce and croissant bread pudding w/ice cream and lots of lil extras that just took it over the TOP:) 

The desserts were GREAT but after taking home the bread pudding and trying it the NEXT day it seemed even BETTER 

What a wonderful dining experience-pleasant atmosphere, truly fantastic personal service, and the food was to die for. I would recommend it to EVERYONE and if you are on Death Row(Texas reference) and have to select your LAST MEAl-If you wanna feel that feeling like you've REALLY lived now-ORDER it from Vic & Anthony's!!"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"15 miles from the Las Vegas strip this place claims to have Iowa Pork Tenderloin Sandwiches and since it's been more than 5 years 
since we had one we were determined to make the drive. When we arrived it looked very promising a large crowd was gathering next door for the car show and once we entered the place had a very cool atmosphere with 
TV's on every wall,classic 50's 
boothes and all kinds of car memorabilia. Plus 
theres a bar & game room upstairs. There was no wait & plenty of seating when we arrived at 6:00 pm. After we were seated , 20 minutes later a teenage waitress came to take our drink order, 20 minutes later she came back with the drinks and took our order. We ordered 4 sliders,Fried Cheese, Pork Tenderloin & Country Fried Steak Sandwiches. A little pricier than the menu we had found on the 
interent but still fairly reasonable. While we waited for our appetizer we saw several disgruntled patrons complaining about the slow service & leaving. After an hour of waiting we still had NOT seen our waitress for a refill or explanation. There were at most 30-40 patrons in the place at this time. The people sitting across from us had to have waited 20 minutes for there bill and finally a 
waitress brought them every unpaid check and asked which one was theirs, the man left exact cash for the check & voiced quite loudly to no one in particular he wasn't leaving any damn tip-for what? On 2 
occasions while we were waiting with our EMPTY glasses on the edge of the table as a CLEAR sign we needed MORE to drink the waitresses would turn tail and run before they made eye contact and had to DO THEIR JOB!! Finally fed up with waiting for NO APPARENT REASON we decided to give up and go somewhere that actually serves their customers. We approached the waitress to find out what the problem was she laughed & said ""it's crazy in here"" with no apology or explanation for the ABSURDLY long wait. HELL we've waited an HOUR to get into a place with NO problem but an HOUR to see your waitress after you've ordered-NEVER and we eat out 3-4 times a week! To say it was BAD service is an understatement. We never had a chance to try any of the food but without a doubt there was NO way it would have been good enough to compensate for the 
atrocious service. The only way I would recommend this place is if it were FREE & they were POURING booze down your throat while you wait. IF you are looking for a disrespectful smart mouthed teenager to give you SHIT this is your kind of place. BUT if you expect to get what your paying for Quality Food & Service you MOST definitely will NOT find it here."
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"Recently @cocosrestaurant replaced the cafe at Palace @stationcasinos and is the ONLY thing open 24/7.

The ONLY way this place is still open is they get enough drunks who can""t taste a thing and don't care about service to dine here every weekend.

I decided to go here 3 times before I posted anything to give them the benefit of the doubt. At first I ordered a sandwich for lunch-Turkey Club(takeout-not pictured)Then I ordered Dinner-Steak,Baked Potato & Veggies pictured at the bottom. And Finally Breakfast-The Lumberjack slam pictured at the TOP.

The sandwich was fairly decent-nothing spectacular I mean I wouldn't order it again but it wasn't bad.

2nd trip we decided to do dinner. We had just finished picking at a plate of fried appetizers of which the fried green beans were the only thing worth getting again. The mozzarela sticks not all the way done, the onion straws/rings overcooked and the chicken fingers just ick:(

My son ordered a Burger + Fries and after 10 minutes the waitress came out and said they had NO FRIED but another dozen potato options to choose from but NOBODY knew how to turn a potato into fries:(

I ordered the Steak Dinner with Baked Potato and Veggies.

The steak dinner had to be the WORST meal ever set in front of me:( 

Our waitress who seems to be the ONLY waitress brought out our meals an immediately I knew ""NO WAY"" this is NOT good. The baked potato was all sunken in but NOT cut open, so I cut it OPEN and it was DAYS OLD-all BROWN and shriveled. THe steak was a small thick round cut_ you KNOW that piece of MEAT you NEVER serve--grill marks this way & that and it just looked RIDICULOUS!! Even the veggies were ICE COLD. 

I didn't even wait for the waitress to come back before I just got up and walked out before I said something I would REGRET. HOW the hell does a WAITRESS not know better than to bring something looking like that out.

The manager came out talked to my wife and said he'd take it off the bill. WHAT?? that's it?? Take it off the bill?? That's a given I wasn't gonna eat or pay for that SHIT!!! Apparently having RETURN customers is not part of their initiative.

Well...even after this experience-since this is the ONLY 24/7 restaurant in the neighborhood I decided to try breakfast thinking HOW can you F-- up eggs, right?

I ordered the Lumberjack Special-3 meats-3 eggs with French Toast and coffee. Well when th coffee came out lukewrm after the waitress assuring us she had just ""made it herself"", all my hopes were crushed:(

The meal came out quick enough and looked ok. The eggs were done, the meat was cooked through BUT the french toast was hard as a rock:( Overall it was ok at BEST, I mean I finished it because I was starving but I surely won't find myself spending ANY money here EVER again:("
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"Here we are again at Shari's Diner on N Buffalo in Summerlin. This 50's style diner has been one of out most visited reviews. We were featured twice on Shari's new website and I just got in some really cool mini business cards from Food Buzz  show my blog & me as a featured publisher of Food Buzz, so I thought we had better revisit this place and see what's changed. 
We decided to go for a late lunch about 1 pm on Sunday afternoon, we had just finished what we hope to be the last of the Christmas shopping. Well we seated ourselves because there was nobody and I mean nobody around. The place was DEAD!!. There was an older man who could have passed for homeless sitting off in the corner by the restrooms. After a few minutes we were given menus and ordered drinks. Last time here they had just opened and had paper menus so now to see a real menu was nice. We wanted to order an appetizer since the kid usually fills up on it and doesn't want a whole meal. Again they had NO Green Fried Tomatoes-If you are gonna offer them on the menu you should probably have a source of green tomatoes, like maybe home grown hydroponic or a vendor. So things started somewhat poorly.
I then asked if they had the Sweet potato fries w/ powdered sugar and she said yes-Isaw her write something down and then I ordered myself a Lola Special-Teriyaki Chicken Sandwich, a Happy Face Pancake for the boy, and a Sandi Melt for the wife.
While we waited for the food we took advantaged of the 2 for $0.25 jukebox filled with 50's classic rock music.
The food came out with NO appetizer-she must have forgot and I never got a chance to ask before she went away. Well the wife was extremely disturbed that the side of sweet potato fries she ordered came dusted in powdered sugar because that's NOT what she ordered nor was she informed they were served that way. The patty melt was good but the cheese wasn't quite melted. The pancake had whipped cream on it where the eyes & nose go, so the kid cried about that but was fine once it was covered in syrup. The bacon was good & crispy but small like 1 piece broken in 2.
The chicken teriyaki sandwich was great-grilled perfectly-tender & juicy but cooked. The teriyaki sauce was tangy & spicy and the onion rings/pineapple tings with the Hawaiian sweet roll bun was the perfect mix. A very filling sandwich. The fries were hot & crispy too. 

Overall the food was pretty good minus the powdered sugar , but this time around the service was a little lackluster. Halfway through our meal another couple with some kids arrived -they were the only ones there besides us. They were seated near us in a table that had syrup on it and had not been wiped down. I did notice the seats are a little grungy and some have been torn and duct taped up. The place was like a ghost town. Lunch hour on Sunday Afternoon and nobody there"
3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,"After living here 10 years I figure I have seen enough to have something to say.

What started as a rural community with a few subdisions and of course the toursist attraction of a street full of casinos & hotels. The Strip.

Then it was NightClubs,StripClubs,MegaRessorts, and World Class Dining & Entertainment.

This place has morphed into a Metropolis with freeways criss-crossing the city and MegaResorts, Supermalls, neighborhood strip malls and neighborhood casinos suburban communities like Summerlin, Del Webb, Lone Mountain, and all the subdiviisions.

Houses were built by the 1000's overnight with imported labor. Population went from 60K to over 300K in less than 5 years.

WHat happend?

Schools are 48th in the country which is BAD.Huge class sizes, very underqualified teachers and lots of non-english speaking.40% high school drop out rate!!

Healthcare is non-existant-UMC the county hospital receycled needles spreading Hepatitis last year.Plus nurse shortages.

Courts, County Commission, Mayor and other Governemnt Offcials are corrupt as they come.-The mayor is a former mob attorney. County officials have been indicted & convicted of many crimes, Judges & lawyers arrested regularly. Its madness

Parks & Recreation is where we actually exceed expectations. Theres lots of parks and stuff to do without having to gamble.Lots of sporting events for the kids.

Jobs-Well pay is relatively low unless you are in a high tip paying job or a stripper or something illegal.
Most jobs on the Strip require a Sherrifs Card which cost you $40-$50 and requires a background check and fingerprinting at the police station.
Some jobs also require a Health Card for food handling etc, this requires you to go to the hospital and get a TB shot and watch a video some people have to get other shots too.
Then there the TAM card-Tobacco & Alcohol Managemnt-waitresses,bartenders,clerks and lots more have to get this card which requires a class & test to complete. Plus it cost you $80-#$00.

Food & Entertainment.-Well everyone knows about the Fancy Chefs and all their Fancy restaurants on the Strip but Las VEgas is filled with culinary delights. Many people relocate here and bring their own cuisine and styles.

There's tons of community events for familys and Vegas knows how to throw a party. The big Holidays are always loaded with tourists  but you kind find many intimate events throughout the year.

Lots of quality librarys and other resources.


Casinos have been allowed to build in residential neighborhoods so now nearly every neighborhood has a casino of some kind which is nice if you like $2.99 breakfast & other thinngs casinos offer.

The bus system has added the Duece to its fleet making ir a little better but its still a little slow. The monorail has been erected but not completed. It seems it would be a better beenfit going to & from the airport to the strip.

Many of the traditional casinos had been imploded & new ones bigger & brighter and more expensive have been built in their place. Condos on the strip have become a reality and even Trump has come to town.

Our XFL Football team came & went. We have lots of sporting events and concerts to attend and at reasonable prices.No real chance of ever getting a PRO sports team..

Las Vegas is hot & sunny 300 days a year and for some a little too hot but we adapt and learn to beat the heat.

We have pools in our backyards all hotels and apartments have them too. Lake Mead & Hoover Dam is just a drive to the water even though its been less than impressive over the years.

It's pricy to live in the city but you have everything you need right in the neighborhood, lots of great finds & deals around, usually plenty of jobs to go around and there's always a little luck.

You can take a vacation just by going down the strip or downtown , theres always something new & exciting. Learning to use the comp system at the casinos makes living in Vegas so much funner.

Prostituion may not be legal but there's plenty of Escorts for you and Marijuana has been decriminalized so the cops don't fuck with you plus the quality has gotten alot better with all the legal supply in California nearby.I love this place all you can eat munchies for under $10 everyday!!"
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"Hank's Fine Steaks and Martinis is located inside Green Valley Ranch. It is an upscale restaurant and bar. After swimming at the pools there, we decided to eat somewhere. As we walked toward the exit, I saw there were advertising happy hour at Hank's so we decided to go check it out.

The atmosphere inside is sleek and elegant, with soft lighting and modern booths, and I especially like the illuminated bar top. We were able to get in wearing shorts, not sure if that was a good thing.

Happy Hour is from 4pm-7pm nightly in the bar/lounge area. Great half Price Martinis with reasonably priced Appetizers. 

We had the Alaskan King Crab Cocktail that contains shaved Fennel, Herb Salad, Dijon Sauce and Tobiko. It was tasty and fresh. I also like the Lobster Gougeres.

I didn't care for the Crispy chicken and biscuits. 

The server thought we only ordered the Crispy chicken and we waited for awhile then found out he didn't hear the rest of the order. He wasn't friendly.

We asked for the bread and they were soft and    made well. I was going to give it a three stars rating but my bf who has been to this place before loved this place so much, I decided to give it a 4 stars. Also I really liked the live entertainment, he was really good."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"Wow! Just ordered some take out dinner at Chuchote and it was phenomenal! I have tried many Thai restaurants in Las Vegas and this one is my new favorite!

This is a family owned restaurant that serves Southern Thai food and was opened 7 or 8 months ago.

They have a large selection of Thai  sweet & sour drinks & traditional Thai desserts.

When I entered this place, it has a very authentic ambiance, and inviting atmosphere. I would not recommend this place for a big group as it is a small restaurant.

The food is the main reason I give 5 stars and it is fairly priced. My favorite are 
~Pad See Ew Noodles with beef. That's what I order in every Thai restaurant. Large chunks of beef on top of perfect stir fried flat rice noodles, with egg, garlic, and broccoli with black bean sauce. It was not oily compared to other places.

~Thai Sukiyaki Noodles is a stir fried silver noodles with shrimp, chicken, egg, napa cabbage, carrots, cilantro and green onion. It was packed with flavor.

The presentation of the dishes and desserts are beautiful and everything is cooked fresh to order at a spice level from 1 to 10.

Make sure you check into Yelp to get a mini Shaved Ice.

I will recommend to all of my friends and will be back soon. Woot! Woot!"
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"This place was amusing. It is a hospital themed restaurant in downtown. There is a weigh machine inside and can be seen outside  that customers that weigh more than 350lbs eats free. Once you enter, the hostess and waitress dressed in nurse uniform comes and help you get into a hospital gown and a bracelet similar to what you would wear at the hospital. The waitor and waitresses (""nurses"") take orders (""prescriptions"") from the customers (""patients""). Each patient wears a hospital gown before ordering and those who do not finish their meal receive a paddling by one of the ""nurses"" with the option to buy the paddle afterwards. I had a burger and I couldn't finish it and had no place to hide it, I tried. The male nurse gave me 3 wacks while my friends videoed me and laughed their butt off. It was all a good fun but man did it hurt!  The menu includes ""Single"", ""Double"", ""Triple"", and ""Quadruple Bypass"" hamburgers ranging from 8 to 32 ounces of beef and all-you-can-eat ""Flatliner Fries"" (cooked in pure lard), beer and tequila, and soft drinks such as Jolt and Mexican-bottled Coca-Cola made with cane sugar. The food was okay but I thought it was a fun place to come and people watch being paddled so come with single friends or for ladies night out."

Phenomenal food and experience here! My bf and I came for lunch couple of days ago and we loved it!
A modern, clean dining area with high top tables on one sides. We sat on their comfortable dining chairs on the other side. There were 4 tables of couples seated when we were there. Surely it means on the pricier side LOL!  Actually I prefer quality over quantity, prices are little high but compared to the Strip and the quality of the food it's reasonable. Their food are healthy and they have vegan and gluten free options as well.

Their friendly, professional waiter sold us on one of the appetizer specials called Vol-au-vent. It's a small round case of puff pastry filled with a savory mixture, and shrimp in a delectable richly flavored sauce. I ordered Duck leg salad as my entrée which was nice but we both loved Pork more, so simply delicious and flavorful. For deserts, we had Pistachio cake. Everything was light but with an explosion of flavors. The presentation of the meal were exquisite.

This restaurant was one the most amazing and impressive food and flavor I have had experienced in a very long time. The waitress who also waited on our table was  very sweet and helpful. I would recommend to anybody for a special occasion."

Tropicana Ave. They are serving breakfast and lunch, with a selection of wallet-friendly sweet and savory crepes, for a mere $6.95 to $8.95 price point.

Their crepe ordering process is made simple by marking what toppings you want on a slip of paper.

They offers a variety of crepes to indulge your every cravings. On this visit I was surprised to find Savory Crepe. I had to try it so I ordered Pizza Crepe with Pepperoni, Salami, Black olives, cheese etc. It looked like a pizza but instead of bread,  it was crepe and was crispy yet pancake soft like. 

I can honestly say that this is one of the best crepe I ever had. It was only $8.95 large enough for 2 people. I can't wait to visit again and try some sweet crepes.

The Thai Tea with boba was the perfect pairing for my crepe.

If you find yourself craving delicious crepes, icecream and frozen yogurt, you won't be disappointed. The staff/owners are friendly and inviting and the place has a nice casual vibe."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"We came here with a couple of friends three days ago. The theater is small so I like the fact that all seats are good seats. They are close to the stage and you can see everything up close.. Before the show, you can go to the Pegasus Bar for their Happy hour. Their food, drinks and service were on par. The Pegasus showroom is located in The Alexis Park Hotel and the parking is free.

Naathan Phan was seen on America""s Got Talent, Superbad, Wizard Wars, Masters of Illusion, Penn & Teller: Fool Us... to name a few. He was very entertaining. He talked to the audience about his life etc, he mentioned this was his 5th week and he also got audience involved in the tricks. He also has a nice personality and seems very humble. He incorporated his  combination of comedy with sleight-of-hand, impressions, storytelling, singing and improvisation.

My fave was the trick with Martini and Mix drinks and he could really sing Opera!!. The audience also get to try the mix drinks, bottle of wine, and prizes for participation. The show is family friendly and lots of audience participation.

After the show, he would take autograph if needed and there is a table set up with some martini glasses, shakers etc for sell. I also got to take pictures with him! Try it, the tickets are  affordable too!"
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"Spectacular, Incomparable and Moving!
It's my first time seeing this show last night. 

The production was created by Franco Dragone and is similar to the shows produced by Cirque du Soleil.

There was a show discount during Summer and the total price for two tickets were about $188, and we sat on the 5 rows from the stage. The view is good no matter where you sit. It's a circular stage in the middle immersed in water, and the audience sits around the stage.

I was mesmerized by the special effects, acrobatics, stunts, and agility of the performers.

Le Reve has quite a bit of ballroom dancing in addition to the ""Cirque"" performances.

I've no complain about the show but some people have no remorse. An elderly man who sat behind my bf was constantly kicking the seat, I think he had Parkinson's or didn't give a f*ck. That was annoying and this isn't a cheap movie ticket. After an hour or so my bf got up asked if he could please sit up straight up and not kicked the chair but he did it even more, so my bf went to box office and told them about the situation. Paul, the manager there is very nice and gave him 2 free tickets to the show valid for one year.

If you're visiting Las Vegas or if you're a local, go see it for yourself. I am pretty positive you'll have a memorable experience."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"I stopped by here for dinner after work. Once in a while, I would dine alone for my 'quiet time.' It was my first time here, I noticed the outside looked simple and when I walked in, I was 'Wowed' by the ambiance, it was very modern and beautiful. 

The hostess wanted to seat me at a table and I requested a booth. She wasn't happy and says something like 'just for 1 person..?!!' As I walked closer I noticed the booths were quite big and sits 4 people. I did felt bad that I asked for a booth but I never had a problem asking for a booth before in other places. 

Anyways, I asked if they had Goat curry, she said they don't. Most Indian restaurants would cook it even though not listed on the menu. But that's ok. I was going to get Korma with Lamb. She recommended Rogan Josh.

The food came out in 15 mins, not too bad on the wait. The dish came with a small bowl of rice and they were ok. I have had better. I thought it was pricey being $16 the portion was small compared to other restaurants. I do really like Rose Lassi.

The restaurant were really nice but the restrooms needs work, some nooks and corners looked run down and the latch to the door almost didn't open for me. For a moment, I thought I was locked in LOL!

The manager checked up on me and is very nice. I had a quick dinner like 30 mins and left."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"Nine of us made it here for dinner last night and I found it very Authentic.

This is a really cool cafe and what seems to be a family owned and operated restaurant. The inside is very cozy and decorated with interesting Cuban style artwork. When I called them, they mentioned to make reservations if you have more then 5 people.

Their happy hour is from Monday to Friday, buy one get one drinks from 5pm to 8pm and live music and dancing from 9pm.

The menu is loaded with a good variety of choices. It was tough to choose what I wanted and I asked the server what is popular. He said the Tasting Plate and The rack of Lamb. They bring out a basket of bread, buttered and toasty.

I got the tasting plate, because I think it would be a good idea and I was very pleased. It was priced at $16.95 and was one of the more expensive items on the menu, but you get an abundance of traditional favorites. It has Beef ( Ropa vieja), Pork (Puerco asado) and Chicken ( Pollo Grand Marnier) and comes with rice and beans, sweet plantains, and a lettuce salad. My fave was the beef and the rice.

The wonderful and unique flavors of all the dishes are hard to describe and definitely something you will have to try. The service was very friendly but was slow. We waited a while for the food and the check.

Overall, Simplemente Delicioso!"
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"Even though it was my first time here, I had a feeling it was going to be good based on reviews ;) I took my bf here as a surprise for a date night and we had an amazing meal. 

The restaurant specialize in fresh
oysters, sashimi and creatively hand crafted cocktails. Fish flown here daily is what I learned.

The restaurant had a casual, relaxed atmosphere and is small so I would suggest making reservations. We sat at the bar and it was the best seats for us as the open kitchen is in front of you. I like the showcase of an array of oysters on a bed of ice.

The menu was very unique and makes me want to try them all. The drink chose was one of the best drink I had called

Penelope crafted with

Vodka, Sake, Lime, Pomegranate Shrub, Shiso, and Fennel Bitters.

From the Happy hour menu ie 5pm to 6pm we ordered:


*Spicy Tuna Tartare, Waffle Fries 

*Ceviche of Octopus, Shrimp, White Fish, Habanero 

*Shishito, Cauliflower, Pistachio

*Hush Puppies, Blue Crab, Jalapeno  

*Deviled Eggs, Fried Oyster  

*Spicy Chicken Wings, Pickled Root Vegetables  

From the Specials Board Menu:

Fluke Carpaccio

All the foods had so much flavor, good blend of consistency and texture and so freash! Everything we tried had a bit of kick to it and we were a happy camper.

The staff were attentive, efficient and personable


We will be back no doubt!!"
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"Do NOT buy from here! I purchased my dining table last month from this store. I searched for furniture store online and saw this. When I stopped by they were having a grand opening and most furnitures were on sale.

I really liked a glass dining table and after checking out a super expensive store before this, the table sounded cheap. I tried to negotiate, and got it for $700. The delivery is free and they would installed and I think the girl said that was the specials that day. Since I was paying cash they comp the tax. The girl who helped me was ok with me coming back and bringing the cash.

They delivered it 2 weeks later. The men had dirty hands though and had smudges all over. I was so happy after I cleaned the table and wanted to give 4 stars rating but I waited. The table was still dusty and my bf thoroughly cleand it and noticed there were 3 long scratches.

I called them and they said they would replace it. She mentioned they have to see if it's in stock. After 2 weeks I called back to check and schedule for them to exchange the table.

The truck came and the two men showed me that the table was in a box. They installed and later I cleaned it really good and found even more scratches and some patches, defects and smudges. 

It looks like that's the way the products are made and I just let it go and live with it. I do love the modern design though."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"My parents and I stop by here yesterday. It was their soft opening, their grand opening is on Dec 3rd.  It is located on the corner of Sahara/Las Vegas Blvd. The parking is free, that's a good thing and we had no problem finding a spot. Look for a door to the elevator if you can't find it. And there is valet as well. There's not a lot of traffic to get there to play some games and eat.

As we walked in, I noticed the exquisite Lucky glass dragon sculpture/Chandelier for good luck. The casino is small yet intimate and beautifully decorated with red and gold which are the lucky colors. There are no fourth floor as 4 is bad luck.There are about 37 table games and 300 slot machines. There is a walkthrough bridge to the hotel rooms.

There are five restaurants onsite and the  ""night market,"" which is inspired by street food outlets in Taipei and Beijing looks promising. The Jewel Kitchen is a glassed showcase for watching the chefs at work. The Phoenix is a 60-seat fine dining establishment,  Pearl's Ocean is a dim sum restaurant and Bao Now is grab-and-go type of dining. The property's Cha Garden is a 24-hour indoor-outdoor tea garden that extends from the hotel lobby into a small pool area and has its own tea sommelier, which is a first in Southern Nevada.

I am definitely returning for the experience, their dining, casino games and lounge in their beautiful pool areas."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"Our experience at Yonaka today was marvelous. They serve Sushi and Japanese style tapas with a modern twist. All the dishes we ordered are artfully presented with a nice selection of both hot and cold plates.

Daily happy hour runs from 5.00pm - 6.30pm available only at the bar and then from 9.30pm to not sure when..

Their happy hour offers an array of small plates and sushi priced between $3 and $7, and sake, beer and wine options priced between $3 and $10.
 
Ambience is simple and modern playing tasteful lounge music.

We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the sushi chef make sushi.

The waiter set a simple complimentary little appetizer on our counter. Granny Smith apples with Pear and the sauce on it was unique. 

I haven't finished this plate and the busser/food runner walked by and took it away so quickly. 

Some of the food we ordered are:

Pork Belly Bacon Bao - the bun is soft, light, and fluffy, with a thick cut of savory pork belly that was crunchy and is full of fatty goodness and flavor. 

Tea-braised Pork ribs - my bf liked the flavor and the texture of this dish. The meat almost tasted overcooked to me.

Lipa Roll- perfect fish to rice ratio. The quality was fresh and the textures and flavor combinations melts in my mouth.

Fried Chicken Bao- lighty breaded, soft and slightly crispy with the same fluffy Bao..so delectable.

 We will absolutely be back!"
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"What an amazing hike! it exceeded my expectations. 
The hike is located along Highway 93, south of the Hoover Dam in Lake Mead National Recreation Area, about 45 minutes southeast of Las Vegas.
From town, drive out to Lake Mead NRA, over the bridge into Arizona, and then down to the White Rock Canyon Trailhead. 

The hike is easy to moderate 5.5miles or so. There is a fair amount of up and down, and there is some scrambling and there's a good amount of walking through sand & gravel. You will be using the same trail-head as if you are going to Arizona Hot Springs. Instead of entering the slot canyon to the springs, you'll branch off to the right and follow a wash toward an abandoned magnesium mine. We saw an old ore hopper.

Keep following the trail, you approach Liberty Bell Arch, which is a natural erosion of rock that resembles the Liberty bell. The entire hike was filled with beautiful colorful scenery and all kinds of terrain. The arch was grand and impressive.

In the distance, you'll see the new O'Callaghan-Tillman Memorial Bridge that bypasses Hoover Dam. From the arch, continue following the trail as it goes up some ridges as you ascend to the highest point of the hike.  The view from here is amazing. Below is the Colorado River separating Arizona and Nevada.  It truly is an incredible sight as you look about 1,000 feet below and see boats and kayaks on the river."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"The ""Tree of Life"" or as I call it ""Listening Tree"" is the most impressive and unique idea to me. Headphones dangling from a tree plays different music. I gave it a try and heard all kinds of music- hip hop,  pop, country, kids music, stand up comedy, and more. At night it looks more pretty with the lights. Originally opened in 1953, this Bunkhouse was reopened after being revitalized by Tony Hsieh's Downtown Project.  

The large outdoor area has a booth for eating and drinking in the bed of a 50's pick up truck. I found that and the decor so cool. There is a window with complete access to the bar and kitchen, if you chose to stay outside. The piano outside was colorful. 

The food are not as many choices, but what is has, it does well. Slow-cooked turkey, pork, beef and vegetarian sloppy joes, hand and cheese sandwiches served with a bacon-jalapeno jam,Mac and cheese and  deviled eggs. The menus focuses on a sort of down-home country style that serves the rustic character of the place. I had no complain of the food either.

This place is touted for indie-rock live music. There were 7 of us and we were planning to see who was interested in going inside to see the bands. It's $10 per ticket and they told us they will give us $30 total. If you decide to stay outside you can still hear the music. I couldn't stay as I had to volunteer tomorrow but my friends stayed. I love this place."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"The best Korean restaurant in Las Vegas! We showed up at 4pm today and the place was pretty full which was a good sign. As we walked in, I immediately notice how cute the ambience and decor was, it had a lot of character. Located in a corner spot near KFC and a nondescript business center. The industrial interior has been designed with props, posters, and artwork from the '80s and '90s.

There were few menu items, serving only beef and pork and concentrating on the quality of the ingredients. 

The best part is they actually cook for you and the servers alternate if your original server is busy with something else. No need to worry about getting them burnt the servers will save you the trouble!

We ordered the Hobak Family Combo ($51.99 for Small, $84.99 for Large) - includes Hobak Marinated Skirt Steak, Hobak Aged Short Ribs, Angus Boneless Short Ribs, Grilled Spicy Pork Belly, Bean Paste Stew, Steamed Egg, Vegetables, Cheddar Cheese, and Rice

Amgus short rib meat was so juicy and tender.  Also the marinated skirt steak was tender and sweet.

The tables have electronic buttons built in so if you need service or want the check, just touch the button. 

Their motto is ""sharing great things,"" they encourage groups to enjoy the charcoal and gas cooking experience.

My boyfriend and I definitely says it's 5 stars rating and would come back and also bring  our friends and visitors for a great Bbq experience."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"I came here today for lunch with my parents and my boyfriend. I wanted to venture out and try a different establishment from the ones we always go to. I called and made reservations and sure enough the place was packed and people waiting. 

Some of the dimsum we had were ~

SHRIMP SHIU MAI
Not my favorite shiu mai, but not absolutely terrible.

STEAM BBQ PORK BUN
I really like the steam buns because the buns themselves are sweet, but the bun to meat ratio is ok because sometimes in other places, only a few pieces of the pork; so you're left with a lot more of the bun.

CHINESE BROCCOLI WITH OYSTER SAUCE
I always have to have a veggie dish with my meal and this was my fave I get everytime I go to a dimsum place. I like the broccoli on its own and also I add sweetness from the sauce.

CHICKEN FEET
Small but soft. Texture wise, it's average. 

DEEP FRIED SESAME BALL
This is one of my mom's favorite dessert. I really love the crispiness and sweetness of the ball.

SPARE RIBS
This is a tricky dish because the flavor was there, but it was chewy.

STEAM CHICKEN
This dish was pretty simple. It was completely steamed, but it was cold. 

They didn't have Jellyfish, duck, sweet tofu, noodle dish, etc. 

The hostess had a microphone announcing the next table and it was loud and annoying. The service was not good as we had to keep getting their attention for more water, napkins etc. They needed more staff.

Overall, I give it 3.5 stars."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"Last night after having some Tapas, my bf and I decided to try Tang Tang Tang but they were houseful. Instead we ended up here which is right next door. Some websites says it's Hunan Restaurant. They serve very authentic Hunan cuisine from China, which is quite similar to Szechuan and the food is spicy, which I love. Hunan Cuisine is hot, sour and salty.

We ordered ~

Griddle cooked duck $8.95
Loofah & minced Pork Soup $8.95
Hunan Fried rice $8.95
Pork Feet noodle soup $8.95

The good news is the food were delicious and seasoned well esp. the Hunan fried rice and the Griddle cooked duck. The portions are huge.

I read on the reviews that you can specify the spiciness levels but the waitress didn't mention plus she didn't speak much English. There was one waitress that spoke English. You might have trouble reading the menu if you aren't Chinese because most of the entrees were in Chinese. They were no description on the food so you have to guess.

The place was busy and it took a while for our food to arrive, around 25-30 mins or so We also had to flag down our waitress each time we needed something. Great pros is everything on the menu is pretty cheap compared to the large amount of the food you get! We noticed they charged us a $1 each but we didn't get tea but they were so busy we just ate it.

I really hope they do something about the service and the wait time. I plan to come back but have to keep in mind the food take awhile."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"I looked up on yelp to find a good massage place and I am sure glad I found Best Food Spa. I called in for an appointment this past Sunday. My bf and I had the Deep tissue massage was $22/hr per person. The yelp check in includes the discount. The $22 is the specials that they had going on. The regular price is $38.

We had a separate room and they ask you if you want water, then the reflexologist placed a bucket of warm water to soaked my feet. My guy Harry does about 10min of shoulder massage while sitting up. The stiff and tight neck pain was gone.  

Then you lay on your back and about 10mins of top of head/front temple massage and then arms and hand. Then about 10 mins you get a back rub while you lay on your stomach. He asks if you want hot stone for $4. He used his elbow and even his knees which was just right pressure.

As far as my boyfriend's opinion he said the girl he had, Linda is her name had a great technique and pressure. She walked on him and was not painful.

You want to wear comfortable clothes cos you don't have a private room where you can take your clothes off. They massage with your clothes on. They had shorts if you want to change into. The only thing that bothers me is the noise of the door opening and closing and the people talking.

I wished they have a stamp card. We gave them $15 per person for tips. Overall, this is a much better massage than the other place we have been going. Definitely going to be our regular monthly massage place now."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"This place is the bomb! we stopped by here last night for the first time. I was really surprised how great the food was because I thought it was probably not going to be too good at a karaoke place. Boy, was I wrong.

Upon entering, you get a really nice feeling, there was a fireplace, a piano and tables and bookshelves with books. The bar has a nice selection of wine and spirits.

The staff took us to room J. There are 10 rooms (each room are themed differently) you can book a room in advance esp on the weekend. The rooms are very clean with comfy booths and tables and the karaoke machines. The call button is mounted on the wall if you need the staff just press the button.

Happy hour at 6pm were half off! Rooms are priced from $20/hr (for up to 8 people) and $60/hr for the VIP room for party of 30 people. 

We ordered Butter calamari & langustine, the calamari had no breading and it was one of the best calamari. The Korean Style short Rib Salad was amazing. Chicken thigh skewers were flavorful. The  chicken wings were crispy and sweet. For drinks we had half carafe Lychee martini.

The staff who helped us is super friendly and helpful and very quick with deliveries of food and drinks. As we walked in the room, he said 'let me start out with 2 bottles of water.' Anyone would think that was free but it wasn't. Not a big deal but just a suggestion for them to let us know it isn't free.

 this is a great venue, where else in Vegas can you get a room for yourself! we will definitely return."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"located in Tivoli Village in Summerlin. We came here last night for dinner.  We walked in and asked for a table, it was quite busy so we waited at the bar. We ordered a couple of drinks, and appetizers. Shortly few minutes later we head over to the table..and they were nice to transfer the food upstairs.. This restaurant has a nice layout. The bar is located downstairs while the restaurant and open kitchen is located upstairs. The ambiance was casual but not really cozy or romantic and it was loud maybe because it was housefull.

The menu  offers an arrange of what sounds such delicious items, such as seafood, steaks, salads, small plates etc  

We ordered bone marrow, roasted brocollini, horse radish butterfish and pork belly spicy slaw, grilled cheese sandwich and  Lamb cigars. Bone marrow was filled with onion and no bone marrow on one of the piece and the  waitress was nice enough to trade it with Grilled octopus.   The rest of the food were incredible. 

The fish was cooked perfectly, well seasoned with horseradish crusted and full of flavor. One of the best fish I have had in Vegas. The grilled cheese with short ribbed were incredible. All of our sides were awesome, the pork belly was meaty and the dipping sauce they are served with was to die for.

My favorite sundae was the cappuccino sundae.

Our server was Lauren.She was top notch. The rest of the staff were all wonderful too. We did not have any issue with food delays, water refills or anything. I'll be recommending this place to my friends and family."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"We attended this event today for the first time ( Nov 3rd, 2018). It only occurs on one Saturday and is the fifth year they are presenting this event in Sunset Park. Admission and parking are free.

We went there an hour after they started which was 12pm. There was a lot of handicapped parking ( people were complaining about it too) and we ended up parking on the farthest lot, so get there early. 

I was happy to see there was no line to get in or the park roped off. Just walk in and buy. There was a stage with music playing. There were rides for kiddos and vendor area. There was a Vegan section. The festival was not cramped and trucks were spread out which I liked.

Here are some of the Food Truck Participants:
50 Shades Of Green 
Badass Coffee Of Hawaii
Blitz Boba
Blondies Bacon Creations 
Braud's Funnel Cake Café
Can't Dutch This
Fusion Beastro 
Hot Diggety Dog 
I Luv Cotton Candy

My bf and I tried the Ribbon fries fully loaded ($15 I think) from ' Smoke'n Sam BBQ and it was really crunchy and so good. Also tried Termas Chickpeas and Karkadeh ( refreshing hibiscus extract drink)
from POTs Egyptian food truck. They were interesting.  What caught my eye was the food truck called 'Meats gone wild' and from their exotic menu we got Python w/ rabbit & jalapeno sausage $10 and Alligator sausage  $10. I had a bite of those which had an interesting taste and not my cup of tea.

I didn't see the Sangria festival which was around $28 ticket which was happening simultaneously. 

All in all, I really enjoyed this beautiful day!"
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"I was really excited to try this place when I first read about it online. Everything I read sounds interesting and pictures of the food looks delicious but it wasn't as good an experience as I thought it would be.

I came here with my bf around 5pm today. As we walked in, the hostess asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or table so we chose to seat at the table. I noticed people walking in and they all sat at the bar and my bf heard them talking about happy hour. The hostess should have asks us if we wanted happy hour at the bar or dinner at the table.

Most of the dishes had good combination of ingredients and sounded unique. We put in some orders and was debating between Campfire Duck and Pork Shoulder, the waitress suggested twice to get both. 

The first order came out, called 'Chinatown Clams Casino. ' $7.50 each, pricey and it was just ok. Then 20 mins later, the second dish came out, it was Farm Egg. The dish was bland. The waitress push us three times to get the bread for dipping. The bread was $5 so I don't understand why she was trying to sell this.

The Beef cheek and bone marrow was presented beautifully but the taste was average. Our favorite was Campfire duck. We were planning to order more dishes but decided against it as the price wasn't worth it.

Their libations had interesting names. We went with Jump the Shark. It came in a cute shark cup but the drink was very acidic.

The ambience is nice for bringing dates. The food is just ok, but definitely not worth the price and the portion size. We left semi-hungry."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"We came here this cloudy morning. As you enter the preserve through the office, you'll need to fill out a short form for contact information and save harmless for the City of Henderson. This is good for two years.  There is a classroom indoor with neat things to look at. The staff at the register was friendly and he told us that the telescope outside was pointed toward a hummingbird's nest. Be sure to grab a bird pamphlet.

This area is home to thousands of migratory waterfowl as well as numerous resident desert birds. We saw severals birds including greater road runner, hummingbird and lots of waterfowls. There are nine ponds available for birding, surrounded by both paved and soft surfaces. The paved path is approximately 3/4 of a mile long and is accessible by wheelchair. The soft surfaces are mostly level and allow for easy walking.

Come early and when you visit, expect to do a lot of walking and allow yourself adequate time to visit the area. Also I recommend that you wear appropriate clothing and comfortable, sturdy shoes.  Bring water, a hat, and wear sunscreen. If you do not have binoculars, they have some available for loan.

There are two places where the preserve has observation points which was great for pictures. You also get a great view of the Strip. One is a boardwalk that goes out into one of the ponds where you can get closer to view some of the birds.  It is 4 miles of trail and no worry there are benches in many places throughout the preserve to just relax and enjoy the solitude and sounds of the birds.

I will be back on a sunny day!"
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"Izakaya Go is located in Chinatown; Valley View and Spring mountain. It is a great place for  an authentic Japanese tapas food experience. The place is small but trendy. You have a good view of the kitchen where you can see the chefs working. 

The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters, sushi burritos and traditional dishes. All the food we ordered were exquisite. I have to say the Ramen burger was different and something we never had before and was very delicious. It had a fried egg and a large piece of pork cooked to tender with large portion of seasoned fries that taste like sweet potato goodness. A standout for me was the fresh octopus ball.  It came in six and they had a nice flavor and as you chew it had different textures. The Poki ""Burrito"" was fresh as well. The portion is bigger then a typical sushi rolls, and instead of tortilla a sheet of nori seaweed with rice help contained all the ingredients. Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab served with ponzu sauce was fresh and crispy with a light batter and so was the fried baby octopus. You also get  a cup of complementary green tea in the end.

The seafood were fresh and flown in from Japan. They have a wide selection of sake. However, they did not carry Kurosawa which is one of our favorite but did get an equivalent kind called Kikusui Junmai Ginjo.
The servers were welcoming and attentive. 
The only thing I would advise is the music, they were playing Reggae when we were there. I would suggest to make it authentic is to play Japanese music.
I would recommend this place and would definitely return and try something new."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"I found a new adventure in Vegas! This 3D trick art museum might be the only one in the US to my knowledge. I came here last night with a couple of friends. It was our first time visiting the 3D trick art museum and it was AMAZING! It was a weekday so less people and didn't have to wait to take turns to take photos. The staff was kind enough to give as the Groupon deal, which came out to be $14.50 per person. Regular price is $20.00 per adult.

The museum is located inside a mall. They also have an archery tag, escape room, cornhole, DIY workshops and a whole lot more.  Each activity is priced separately. Once you pay, you need to sign a waiver. Then wait in line and then be greeted by a host. She/he gives you a short tour and briefing, and everything you need to have a memorable experience.

The staff is walking around so if you need assistance, they are available. There are pictures and places marked on the floor to help get the angle for nice photos. which was really helpful. There are about 50 art and Tan, the staff that was working was very helpful. He tells us where to  stand for the best photo opportunities, and even took pictures of us. You can ask them, they were all very friendly energetic and helpful.

Ladies, carry a purse that fit over your neck/shoulder so your hands are free. I had to keep putting my purse on the floor each time to take pictures or my pic to be taken.
The only thing I suggest is to have more  computers to sign waiver, there were only two. It was a little bit of a wait as a big group came in at the same time and I think they went for Escape rooms. Highly recommend!"
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"Based on the great reviews, I stopped by here last night after making orders to take home over the phone. Located on the Northeast corner of Decatur and Twain. The ambiance is lovely and looked like restaurants in Korea I've seen on TV. There are wood and Korean décor and the place is very spacious.

The orders came with side dishes. There was kimchee, fish cake, pickled cucumbers, and pickled radish. I didn't like the kim chee, it tasted old. Except for the kimchee, the other side dishes were on par.  fave is the Nakji Dolpan (Spicy Octopus Hot Stone Plate) - $13.95. The dish is filled with rice, an egg, topped with spicy octopus and other vegetables. The octopus was not spicy imo but tasty alright. I mixed it all up and was delicious. The stone pot had given the rice a very nice, crispy texture which I like.

The Ox tail soup  $14.95 had small and large pieces of oxtails which were tender. The broth was bland. I know we are supposed to put salts and green onions and stuff but it still should have some flavor to it.

Bossam (Napa Wrap w/ Pork), the small portion - $15.95. I read on Yelp that this was a must to order so figured it was a tasty and popular dish. The pork was pretty much semi-cooked fatty pork belly. I had to panfry and recook it. I wasn't a fan and for almost $15 wasn't worth it. It came with spicy slaw, some napa cabbage, and lettuce which I wrapped the pork in it.

The gentleman who was at the cashier is friendly and nice. I am not sure if my bf and I would be back, sorry! Unless there is a special discount, happy hour or promotion for us to go back and try something else on the menu as there are many great restaurants in Vegas."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"A small restaurant in an intimate atmosphere with a modern, and rustic feel.

The Black Sheep has been getting rave reviews, so we decided to pay this restaurant a visit today. I made reservations for 6 and I recommend doing that.

We got there to catch their early Happy Hour which runs from 5-6 pm with $5 wine, $4 craft beers, and $1 fresh oysters on the half shell.  There's also a late 10-11 pm Happy Hour for the night owls.

Here's some of the breakdown of the plates my bf and I shared.

Vietnamese Imperial Rolls - the server mentioned this is the customers favorite. It was fried but the sauces were well- balanced.

Bao Sliders - This is our favorite. The combination of pork sausage and jalapeño aïoli was flavorful and juicy, and the crispiness of the shallot was perfect. I loved the fried quail egg that was paired with!
 
Crispy Mediterranean Octopus - It was good, just not anything special. Doesn't stand out in comparison to the other octopus at other restaurants in my opinion. It would be better not fried.

Chocolate Tres Leches were a little done. The chocolate was overwhelming at first, but then with a little fresh Tres leches butter it all came together and was quite good as a spread.

I wished they had more deserts but this is the only one they had. 

The service was excellent, fast, friendly and efficient.

I am a pretty picky eater, all the food have to be excellent to get a 5 stars rating, I would give a 3.5 on the food but because everything else like the ambiance, music, and service were really pleasant, the place deserves a 4 star. Everyone else in our tables were really pleased on the food they order and we had a great time here."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"I love this place. My friends and I had a delicious and a nourishing meal last night. This restaurant is owned by the same owner who owns Hobak and Gabi which are located on the same shopping complex. Chanko Shabu & Bar is a luxury Japanese hot pot and sake bar. Chanko means ""a meal"" that is eaten by sumo wrestlers, the ambiance is 80s Japan period which was in the golden age. The décor is modern with all bar seating with individual induction burners at each seat. Great for small groups and couples in my opinion.

The menu focuses on three different types of preparation; the slow-cooked sukiyaki, the steam cooked seiro mushi, and its shabu-shabu hot pots.
Some items on the menu are Wagyu short rib, Prime rib-eye steak, and ""muji fuji pork"" which are all steamed on wood trays table side. Shabu-shabu choices include spicy miso pork, vegetables or garlic pork broth with the option of meat or vegetarian ingredients and the sukiyaki selection is currently a prime rib-eye steak.  The restaurant also offers $5 tempura and gyoza appetizers, and side dishes. Deserts includes ice cream and matcha and strawberry shaved ice, and ofcourse wine, beer etc. My meal comes in a basket with veggies and other goodies like fish cake and tofu in cold broth. The food came out fresh with and a lovely presentation. There's a metal plate on the bottom so it heats up quickly on the burner. The food was cooking on a special paper as a pot instead of the stainless steel pans I am used to at other places, so it was really cool experience.

I had the Shau-Shabu with Muji Fuji Pork with spicy miso pork broth. It comes with 2 choice of sauces. One of my friend had Prime ribeye and I tried hers too. The broth was delicious the meats were exceptionally tender.

It was so cool that the chef came to talk to us. He mentioned Chanko Nabe is a type of hot pot made and eaten by a sumo wrestler. It is a part of the power diet for sumo wrestlers and the Muji fuji pork was special dish. Also the special paper as a pot were from Japan. Another cool thing was the wet paper napkins which we thought was something else. All in all, a little pricey BUT worth the quality of the food and the great service you get."
8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,"A Must see!! It is located in Henderson 12 miles from the Las Vegas Strip, it has 46 lions and couples of emus, ostriches, parrots and tiger cub. General admission is $20, last Sunday of the month local gets 15%off. They have trainer for a day $800 base price, and other admissions/event choices. Price goes up to $25 for GA next year so get there now! :)

I love how close you get to the lion some 4-5 feet away, these lions are huge I didn't realized as when I see them in Zoos they are far away. As you walk around the area, you'll learn fun and fascinating facts. I was taking a video of the lion and heard the lion handler yelled 'look out! Look out! The male lions spray urine upto 15 feet, we ran ..that was funny; female lions do all the hunting, as well as share in the newborn's care, African lions eat together and they can sleep up to 20 hours a day and more.
One of the lion is 18 years in captivity but in jungle upto 10yrs. 

I also found out that these lions look so well-groomed all the time, they do get a little bit of help. To make sure the lions look their best, the trainers shampoo their fur with baby shampoo, followed by a blow-dry treatment.Talk about being the ""mane"" attraction! 

We were lucky today, we saw the trainers hand-feeding the lions and giving them balls for some playtime. We saw a 11 weeks old cub so cute! They will also do a $30 to hold the Cubs. I wanted to do that!


These are the lions that used to be at the MGM Grand. They used to transport them everyday from here to MGM but hotel decided they no longer needed them, so they are now live permanently here. I was sad for these lions at first but learned these cages are bigger than the city allowed, in the summer they have an AC enclosed area where they can go inside, they are wells feed and taken care of. The place was well maintained as it looked very clean. The staff were very knowledgeable.

The costs of keeping these magnificent creatures is enormous, so it was a nice surprise to find that it didn't charge extortionate prices. Evans and his wife own this place and the passion they have is seen by their interaction of the cub.

Dont expect a big place like a zoo, this is a habitat and they are going to bring in more animals to make it a zoo.  Take a visit here, something different to experience. I fell in love with this place and the lions!!"
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"I rarely give out five stars, but this is 5 stars and a bag of chips. When we walked in the place it was half full plus a party of 50 upstairs. The young lady who greeted us was very nice and seated us quickly. This used to be a Don Pablo's but you would never know it. Both the exterior and interior have been remodeled. The decor is very industrial yet warm and inviting. 
The beer selection is outstanding-40 taps plus bottles. They have basic beers, a ton of craft beers, and even some hard to find beers. If you use the Untappd (not a typo) app and check in your pic will pop up on the Digital Pour Electronic Draft Menu board. I am not a big beer drinker but I tried and liked the Altec Peach Burbon Barrel Ale. If you ask they will give you samples. They even use the proper beer glasses. 
For dinner we ordered the Pot Roast with Mashed Potatoes, Fish and Chips, and Ribs. The ribs had a great smokey flavor and we're falling off the bones. I thought it was a great price for the amount of ribs you get. The ribs comes with a side of coleslaw. The coleslaw is not overly vinegary or overly sweet. It is a nice compliment to the ribs. 
There were 2 big pieces of beer battered fish. You could taste the beer in the flaky batter. It was cooked perfectly and the fish was moist and delicious. It sat on a bed of fries and had a small side of coleslaw. The fries were good as well. They make their own tarter sauce which looks like Thousand Island dressing. 
The Pot Roast came in a big bowl. The Pot Roast was some of the best I have ever had in a restaurant. It sat on top of homemade mashed potatoes and had a brown gravy poured on top. It was the right amount of gravy-not too much, not to little. It was the perfect consistently. It was topped with crunchy fried onion rings. We all pretty much liked our plates. 
There were all ages of people here enjoying a beer or a meal. We will definitely be back!!!"
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"No. Just no. My son and I were headed to a show at PPG Arena and wanted to eat somewhere near by. I saw that this spot had good reviews so we thought we would try it. My son called and made reservations. 
The day came at I met him in the hotel lobby. We took the elevator up to the 25th (27th?? Can't remember) floor where the restaurant is. When we got there we were told that they weren't ready yet. We didn't even tell them we had reservations. So we waited. . . and waited. Finally my son walked over to the bar and told them that we had reservations. The bartender called a server out. She asked us if we were doing fine dining. I said that I wanted to check out the menu to see what they had. She took us to the back of the restaurant. We found out later that there was a nicer area but it was closed off. All of a sudden all of these people started coming in. It took us a minute and we realized that they were guests of the Embassy hotel. They must have been given tickets for free drinks. The bar line was long and stayed long. They were also given access to a very small snack buffet. The server that waited on us was the one and only server working the entire restaurant. She was constantly cleaning tables and checking on the snack buffet. So we had to wait ridiculous amounts of time to order, to get our food, and to even pay. 
I had ordered a cup of lobster and corn chowder. When I finally got it, it was barely room temperature. It tasted like it was straight out of a can. There was one tiny piece of lobster and about half a can of corn. I hadn't eaten since breakfast and was starving so I ate it. My son tried it and gave it a hard pass. 
As my entree I ordered shrimp tacos. There was seemed to be fresh pico on it but the shrimp was 90% breading. Not good. 
My son ordered the club type sandwich. It had a nice portion of meat on it and tasted ok. (That is what the one star is for.). 
 Was very disappointed from start to finish. I won't be back. Ever."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"What a trip back in time!!  Before you walk in you sense the ""old school that's been refreshed"" vibe. You walk in and can't help but look at everything. It's all original-the floor, soda bar, booths. . . everything.  To the left are wooden booths with marble topped tables. They each have a mirror and a light fixture. Where the booths come to an end there is a row of original wooden phone booths. One of them also has an original pay phone. Down the middle are glass top tables. The back wall are the original wood and have pharmacy bottles on the shelves. To the right is a counter where you order and pay and then  a long bar with cute bar stools that looks like old soda caps. Behind that counter is where the ice cream treats that you order are made. Their menu has lots of sundaes, floats, splits, and other goodies. 
It was fun to look around and see all of the untouched decor. It's like stepping back in time. It's amazing how well everything was made and how well it is preserved. We don't make quality like that any more. 
I had ordered a Super Sundae. It was a house made brownie topped with ice cream, fudge, caramel, pecans, and house made whipped cream. The ice cream is made in house also. It was so good I almost licked my bowl. You have a choice of one or two scoops. My hubby had the Mallow Cup Sundae. It is chocolate ice cream with marshmallow swirled through it. It had chocolate chips and whipped cream on top. He had ordered one scoop but wished he ordered two. While we were eating our ice cream one of the lovely ladies that worked there brought us ice water. It was a nice touch. 
I think every parent should take their kids to show them what an original pharmacy/soda fountain/ice cream shop looks like. I learned today of your kids go in and tell them that they have read the young adult book titled ""Macaroni Boy"" they will get a tour of the back room which is an intact pharmacy. My boys are young adults but I'm going to have them read it and then go back and get a tour."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"I have to start by saying that I was beyond disappointed that the Costco closest to me closed the photo shop in their store.  I've printed thousands of pictures there as well as had photos enlarged and had Christmas cards made.  I received a letter where Costco gave me a $50 credit to go online to order photos but I like doing it in person.  Call me Old School.  So I had to trek out to Robinson to print out my photos.  That is a 30-45 minute drive.  I went in and went directly to the photo department.  I plugged in my phone and went to work.  I was done at 6:02.  The photo shop closed at 6pm that day but they told me that they would have them done for me.  I was so happy because I didn't want to have to make another trip out just to pick up pictures.  I looked around the store and picked up a few things (how could you not at those prices! LOL. I went back around 5:45ish and checked the bin and my pics weren't ready.  I was having 447 prints made.  That Is NOT a typo.  Forgetting that they close at 6 I went back over a few minutes after 6 and the photo shop was closed and my pics were not in the bin.  I was bummed.  I went through the check out and paid for my items and then I stopped at the front counter.  I asked if someone could check to see if my pictures happened to be finished but just not in the bin.  They called up a very nice woman who walked me over to the photo area.  She searched high and low and WA LAAH! She found my two boxes of phots!  That is what you call OUTSTANDING Customer Service.  On top of that, they didn't make me walk all of the way around to exit.  They go permission for me to walk through the sliding gate and exit.  I was THRILLED!!!!!!!!!!  I'm sorry that I didn't not catch the name and of the woman who was working in the photo shop that night but she kept her promise and got all of the prints done.  An even bigger thanks to the woman who looked for my pictures so I didn't drive home empty handed.  THIS is one of the reasons I choose Costco over Sam's."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"We had a late breakfast at this restaurant. I had it bookmarked to go.   It's tucked into a small corner of a shopping plaza. The sign is pink and black. When you walk in there are a few tables to the left. To the right are more tables and some booths. The restaurant is small. The top half of the walls are painted a dark pink-almost plum color. The bottom half is white. There are pictures and quotes on the walls by women like Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn.  There is a bar that you can sit and eat at. I was disappointed to see the laminate tiles falling off of the bar. It made the place seem a bit shabby. 
Our waiter was a nice young man. They give you small muffins coveted with cinnamon and sugar to nibble on while waiting for your meal. My son ordered The Chop. It was 2 eggs (made any way), 2 meats ( bacon, ham or sausage, hash browns, and a huge pancake. It was a huge amount if food. He ate 2/3 of his food and brought home most of the pancake and some of his bacon.  I was excited to see Biscuits & Gravy on the menu so I ordered those. I hadn't read the menu but it tells that they come with eggs and hash browns. I ordered my eggs scrambled and they were very good. The has browns could have used another minute or two of cooking but they were also good. I ordered a side of bacon. It was more chewy than crunchy. It could have been used a little more time on the grill as well. After eating the eggs, bacon and hash browns I was full but really ready to dig into the biscuits and gravy. I was saving the best for last. I took a bite and something wasn't quite right. I was trying to figure out what was different. On my second bite I figured it out. They had used sweet Italian sausage instead of breakfast sausage. And thought it was supposed to be a white-ish country gravy it was almost brown and tasted like a brown gravy. I was disappointed. I boxed them to take them home to my husband who would eat them. 
I would go back again to try a different menu item or two, but I wouldn't rush back."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"This restaurant just opened a few days ago. I was very excited to try it. It's owned by a local couple. I prefer to support local businesses. When we walked in we were greeted warmly and seated quickly. The restaurant is decorated very tastefully. It leans toward a contemporary feel. 
We checked out the menu. I chose the Scallops over Scallion Risotto. When the dish came it was plated beautifully. The Scallops were large and cooked perfectly. The asparagus on top was also cooked perfectly. The Risotto was very flavorful. Since it was scallion I thought it might have a heavy onion taste but it didn't. A lot of people don't do Risotto well but this was the right consistency. It was drizzled with a little herb oil which added to the flavor. 
My husband had the Pork Chop. Some places give you two but they give you one-for good reason. The pork chop is huge!  It is one of the thickest pork  chops I've seen. It was cooked perfectly as well. The pork chop was moist despite its thickness. The pork chop had been kind of ""tomahawked"" which made the plating look very nice. It was topped with an apple chutney that went well with the chop. For sides there were mashed potatoes and a warm broccoli and radish salad. I'm not a huge fan of radishes but these had been quartered and sautéed with some basaltic vinegar. They were very tasty. 
For dessert we shared the Drunken Peach Which was a peach cobbler with vanilla bean ice cream and drizzled with a bourbon sauce. We were both full but couldn't stop eating it. Yes, it was that good. 
Our service was outstanding. Our server was wonderful. She was friendly and kept checking on us and refilling our glasses. 
The beer and bar menu was solid. It was definitely better than any chain restaurant. It covers a lot of craft beer. All of the cocktails used top shelf ingredients. 
Please note that the lunch menu is different than the dinner menu. (I posted pics of both menus).  I already have a friend meeting me there for lunch on Wednesday to give that menu a try."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"It was Mother's Day and my boys took me to the Strip to walk around and have lunch. The place we wanted to eat at was closed. We were standing there talking about where we should go when a friend of my oldest son walked up and started giving us suggestions. When she said Marty's Market I got really excited. I had totally forgotten that it was at the Strip. So off we went. 
We signed in and shopped the market while waiting to be seated. We found all kinds of goodies-fresh grass fed beef and pork, local beers, a great selection of rices to try and a lot of new options to choose to eat. Twice people came by with trial sizes of fresh juices.
We were seated and given a brunch menu. Their were lots of delicious sounding options. My youngest son ordered 2 eggs, bacon, home fries, and toast. He ate every bite. He can be a picky eater so I was surprised. It was all fresh and looked yummy. 
My oldest son couldn't choose between the pancakes or the French toast so I told him the we would each order one and we would share. When our food came to the table I wanted ALL of it!!!  I was drooling just smelling it. 
The pancakes were filled with berries and cooked to perfection. They came with a blueberry syrup that was the bursting with blueberry flavor. It wasn't thick and gooey but instead it flowed lightly over the pancakes. There were so many berries in the pancakes that I don't even know if you needed the syrup. The French toast wasn't made out if white bread or Texas toast but instead it was made of a brioche bread that was light and fluffy. On top of the toast was peach jam and maple foam. Oh My Gosh it was a taste of heaven!  The combination of the peach jam and maple foam was delightful. I can never have regular French toast again. 
I can't wait to go back and try other dishes. Don't forget to hold your place in line with the No Wait app. Marty's Market is a busy place. They also have a great coffee bar. It will be my first stop at the Strip. Nothing like a great cup of coffee to sip on while you shop."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"This was the Grand Opening weekend of this restaurant. We decided to check them out for lunch. When we arrived it was a tad confusing. We didn't want to go into the bar but the dining area. We headed to the area that the sign out front was pointing to but half way up a waitstaff person opened a side doer and let us in. We were taken to the top floor and we were given the option to eat there,the patio/deck or the bar. We decided on the bar. There were two tables to choose from there. Two of the waitstaff gave us the history of the place. It's always interesting to hear. About an older building. There was a couple in there who had been in the building many times through the years so it was neat to hear what they had to say. 
The menu has a lot of options but is not overwhelming. I've always preferred a place that does a few things really well rather than a poor performance on a menu that is enormous. For a place like this we thought their beer options were not that great. In fact we decided not to order any. 
So back to the food menu we went. I ordered the Gouda and Cheddar Mac n Cheese with bacon. It looked good but had absolutely no flavor. None. I was very disappointed. I had them box it up for me and I took it home for one of my boys to eat. I'll add something's to it to give it flavor 
My husband ordered the Piitsburgher Ham BBQ Stacker. It came with a side of fries. It was stacked all right. Almost to high to get a bite but we did. We ended up halving it since I didn't like my food. There was a ton of Chipped Ham and the slaw on it was very tasty too. The fries ate house made and better than a lot of house made fries I've had in the 'Burgh. 
The building has been totally renovated and they did a nice job. I just wish they had a better selection of beer and that my food had some flavor. It was also a little awkward because music would play for a few minutes and then it would be silent for a long period of time and then a few more minutes of music. 
If I ever go back, it would be to have the BBQ Stacker again."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"My family has been rescuing senior dogs for years. It's a blessing to love on pups in their final years. However 12 years ago my son fell in love with some Miniature Pinscher puppies. We weren't familiar with the breed so we talked to the breeder and did some research. We decided to buy a red male pup. It was the first little dog we ever owned. His name was Baxter. He became attached to me very quickly. Fast forward 10 years. Baxter became diabetic and blind. For 2 years he and I spent a lot of  time together at the vet and administering shots. Baxter was the love of my life (after my husband and boys). I knew his time was coming to an end. Sure enough Thanksgiving weekend the time came. My normal vet was closed. They referred us to this office. I called ahead of time to let them know what was happening and to see if we could bring him in. They lady on the phone was so kind. We legit in the car and drove there. My husband went in first to let them know we were there. He came back out and got me and they took us straight to a room. It was a large room with a couch and recliner. A woman came in and walked us through the process of what would happen. First a vet tech came to take Bax to be assessed by the vet. They brought him back to me and said that the vet agreed that it was time (my paraphrase).  They then took Bax to have his arm prepped for an IV. They brought him back to me again. Each step of the way they told me to take my time. I didn't want him to suffer anymore so the Vet came in and administered the two injections. Baxter crossed over Rainbow Bridge, taking a part of my heart with him. I handed Bav to the Vet. They told us again to take our time. When we were ready we exited out of a side door. It was so nice not to have to walk back through the waiting room to leave. 
Having to put an animal down is so hard, but I could not have asked for a better experience than we received at this facility. They were so kind, caring, and compassionate. I can never thank them enough. These 5 stars don't even begin to cover it."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"GO!  GO NOW!  (Well, check to see if they are open and make reservations first).  If you are looking for a fun night out be it a date night, a family night, a team building session, or anything like it THIS is the place you need to go.  I have wanted to go to an escape room for quite a while and I had some Grinch's who thought it wouldn't be fun.  (Oh the joy of having young adult children!). I picked the Imaginarium after doing a lot of research.  PEOPLE!  LISTEN TO ME!  If you really want the full immersion experience then THIS is where you need to go.  We had seven people in our group.  Once we pulled up we met another couple who said that they were going in with our group.  They were experienced escapees.  They had done over a dozen.  They loved doing them so they were going everywhere to do them.  Once everyone in our group arrived we buzzed into the building to let them know we were there.  We were told to enter.  I can't share anything after that because I signed a waiver saying that I wouldn't.  #truestorybro  This is what I CAN tell you.  , , ,we failed.   It wasn't for lack of trying.  Goodness me . . .we worked our tails off to tackle the clues.  Our group was made up of some pretty smart people.  HIGH IQs!!  I have to admit that had we not been grouped with that experience couple I don't think we would have made it far at all.  Afterwards they told us that this was the best but hardest one they had been to.  However, Once we got the hang of it our brains were worked to their capacity.  The gentleman who guided us through and gave little helps along the way did a fantastic job.  Oh, and those young adults ???  LOVED IT!!!!  In fact they want to go back and go through the other experience.  NOT EVEN KIDDING.  The Imaginarium has two experiences.  They change them every 8 months.  So GO!!!  Take your family, friends, and people you don't know.  I know it's only May but I'm thinking what a great Christmas gift for a family with older kids.  You could even take a group as a birthday celebration.  SO MANY OPTIONS. JUST GO!!!!!"
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"I saw a couple of reviews on this restaurant and had to go check it out because it's in my back yard. From the moment we walked in until the moment we walked out it was perfection. We were seated immediately and started checking out the menu. We noticed that you could gets 1oz and 3oz pours of wine. Our server, Marissa, talked with us about all of the different wines. We made our own wine flight of four 3oz pours. We tried a Chardonnay, a Reisling, a blush, and a Red. The manager actually chose the red we tried. About that time they turned the fireplace on. Wine and a fireplace = cozy. We decided what we were going to eat while sipping the wines. We ordered two appetizers and an entree. The first entree was Ahi Tuna with sticky rice. It was served on a wooden board-Tuna down one side and sticky rice down the other. The sticky rice had been toasted and was a little crispy on the outside. There was a very tasty sauce used to decorate the board but was also used to dip the rice in. Then the 2nd appetizer came out-mussels. I had only tried mussels once before and I was not a fan. They brought out a huge bowl of mussels with frites on top. The frites were crispy shoestring potatoes Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. I started eating the frites and my hubby started eating the mussels. He commented that they were the best mussels he had ever had. My curiosity won out and I had to try them. I ended up eating half of the bowl!  I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks. . For an entree we picked a Charcuterie Board. You could get it with or without roasted vegetables. We chose without because we're already getting full. Lo, and behold, they brought us out the biggest Charcuterie Board I have ever seen!  There was meats and cheeses, bacon Jam and figs, pickled grapes and grapes that tasted like cinnamon, pita points and slices of baguettes, almonds, just endless tastes, textures and flavors.  We tried them all and ate them all. What is crazy is that I wanted to try a ""jug"" for dessert but I was waaayy to full. I guess I'll just have to go back. LOL"
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"I've passed this restaurant many times over the last couple of years while driving to see my youngest son who went to school in Johnstown. I never stopped because I knew that the first thing I would be doing in Johnstown was to take my son out to eat. Finally, tonight, on our way back from a business trip we stopped. We were starving. 
The bar was pretty full but on the restaurant side there were only two tables that had diners. That made me a bit worried. 
We were given menus and our drink orders were taken. They scored big points for having a craft beer that my husband had not tried. The menu was extensive and I was starving so I asked the waitress for suggestions. I took her advice and ordered the Pappardelle and Fillet Meatballs. I ordered a house salad to go with it. My husband ordered the Cheeseboard and a Grilled Beet salad. 
Our salads came first. My husband LOVED the beet salad. It had pieces of fresh orange as well as a basalmic dressing. I think he would have licked the bowl if I would have let him. My house salad had no iceberg lettuce in sight. Instead it had a Spring mix with tomatoes, purple onions, cucumbers, and some freshly made croutons. The Bleu cheese dressing was house made and delicious. We were served warm bread with a plate of seasonings and olive oil to dip the bread in. 
Once we finished our salads our enters came. Holy Cow was mine delicious!  The meatball was full of flavor, the pasta cooked perfectly, and the sauce made you want to slap your mama. (I'm from the south and that's a huge compliment). To put the dish over the top was the pieces of goat cheese that were sprinkled over it. The perfect bite was a little bit if each. I barely made it through half my dish before I was full. Hooray for doggy bags!
My husband's Cheese Board came with Prosciutto, Sopressata, Kalamata olives, four or five cheeses, a honey Dijon dipping sauce and sesame crackers. He even took home a doggy bag. 
I'm so glad that I finally had the chance to eat here. I found out that they have a location in Canonsburg. I'll be trying that location SOON!"
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"We had never been to Bella Sera but had heard good things about it. When we saw they were offering a brunch for Easter we decided to go. When I called to make reservations they asked for my credit card number. I've NEVER been asked for that information before. It made me uncomfortable but I have it. We received a call the Friday before Easter that said you had to cancel by Friday at 5 or you would be charged if you were a no show. At $35 a person you definitely don't want to pay that price if you can't be there. I thought $35 a person was steep but I thought the food was going to match the price. I was wrong. 
We knew going in that we were going to sit in the upstairs room. That meant climbing stairs or using the elevator to get to the main room. I wasn't thrilled about it until we got to the venue. The main floor had very little room to move. People were packed in like sardines. We had a lot more room where we were sitting. We had two servers but they must of had tables downstairs also as we rarely saw them. They were nice but we weren't really served. When we would actually see our server we would ask for drink refills. When we would finally get them the ice would be melted. 
As for the food, we were extremely disappointed. We visited the Entree table first. There was waffles, syrup, and a fruit topping. There was a pasta, a potato, some Italian sausage to name a few things. Nothing stood out. I took some of the potatoes and pasta. We then went to the table where the meats were served. They had roasted vegetables which I took some of along with turkey. I didn't get a slice of turkey. I got a scoop full of turkey pieces/crumbles. Before we went upstairs we stopped by the huge dessert table. I grabbed a couple of cannolis. 
We wet upstairs to eat. None of us were impressed with the food. It was definitely NOT worth $35 a person. Two of us didn't finish what we had much less go back for more food. Two people in our party went back down to try different foods but were still disappointed. 
If I pay $35 for a meal I expect a $35 meal. I have paid $17-20 for better food. Obviously we won't go back."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"The hubs and I were in the area and decided to drop in here for dinner.  It's billed as a BBQ joint but the decor was much nicer than a typical BBQ place. The restaurant was about half full when we were seated. I always peek at other people's food before I order in a new restaurant. Everything that came out of the kitchen was plated nicely and looked inviting. 
We decided to split the Sampler Platter. It was $28 which we thought was a little pricey. We added a side to make sure we would have enough food.  We laughed at ourselves when they brought it out. There was a whole table of food!!!  More than worth $28. Way more. 
I started with the boneless chicken breast. The BBQ sauce on it heavily hinted of coffee. It was a very different flavor but I really enjoyed it. The ribs were falling off the bone as I was putting them on my plate. Can you say moist??  The sauce was more of a traditional sauce and it was very good. We had a serving of shredded pork and shredded brisket. Brisket is usually served sliced but I much more preferred it shredded. The sauce for those two items was on the side. It seemed to have a smokies flavor. They gave us a basket of slider buns. The buns were fresh and made a great vehicle to eat the shredded meats. For sides we had coleslaw, baked beans, potato salad, and Mac and cheese. Since Mac n cheese is one of the recent crazes I was curios how it would stand up to others that I have tried. I'm from the South so I will use a southern expression that people use when something is over the top good-that Mac n cheese made me want to slap my momma. I would go back just for the Mack cheese. It was very cheesy. If I remember correctly it had 5 types of cheese. It was melty and gooey and held on to the corkscrew pasta perfectly.  Nomnomnom. 
Now the little bit of sadness. I would have loved to have given 5 stars. However we had poor service. We only saw our server when we ordered our food and when we got the check. Our drinks were never refilled and we asked the young man cleaning tables to get us To Go containers for our food. He was very kind and helpful. Had our server been more attentive I would have easily given 5 stars."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"My friends were getting together for breakfast to celebrate school being out. (They are teachers.) The friend who was putting the gathering together chose this restaurant.  I had been to another Bob's location when it first opened and it was horrible.  It's been awhile so I thought I would give this location a shot.  I was rather shocked when I got there because the parking lot was full.  That's a good thing and a bad thing.  It's a good thing because it means people like it there.  It's a bad thing because I ended up parking on the road.  Two others in our group parked at a business close by that was closed but then got yelled at by a customer of that business.  It would benefit the restaurant greatly if they could find a way to expand parking.  Thankfully though I was parked on the road my car didn't get hit.  We went in and seated ourselves as per the sign.  It took a long time before our server came to our table.  In fact we rarely saw our server.  It was busy when we first went in but cleared out soon after so I'm not sure where the server was.  When she was waiting on us she was very nice.  
I ordered the breakfast that had eggs (I chose scrambled), breakfast meat (I chose bacon), home fries, and toast (I chose Italian).  It took quite awhile for our food to come.  I'm not sure why it took so long and we weren't given an excuse or an apology.  My eggs were soft scrambled.  I would have sent them back but had no idea how long it would be before I got food back.  The bacon was thick and cooked nicely-a little crispy and a little chewy.  The home fries were a bit overdone.  You received a big portion that covered half your plate.  They were ok but nothing to write home about.  The toast was toasted nicely but had a ton of butter on it.  I wiped about half of it off.  I ate about 1/3 of my meal and got a box for the rest.  I was still a little hungry (just turned off by the eggs) so I ate part of a fruit plate that my friend had ordered.  It was the biggest fruit plate I had seen and four of us ate from it.  The fruit was fresh which was nice.  So my experience had it's ups and downs.  I hope you get a good experience if you check this place out."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"This was bookmarked on my Yelp page and I finally had the time to go. In fact, I went twice within one week. This is a very cool place tucked into an older industrial park. Driving to get there I thought I had the address wrong. But then BOOM!  there it was. We were delighted when we walked in. It's actually a very cool place with a great wine list as well as a great beer list. 
My first time there I had the Cowboy Steak. It is a ribeye that comes with grill marks. My steak was cooked to order. That doesn't always happen when you order steak. The inside was cooked to a perfect medium. The outside was slightly too charred for me but it was still good. It came with asparagus and potatoes. The potatoes were slightly crispy on the outside and seasoned perfectly. I love asparagus but theirs was too soft for my liking. I prefer that it be firm.  My husband ordered Beef Tips over Rice. It has a lot of mushrooms but they bring the flavor. The beef tips were some of the best I've ever had. I had their homemade coconut pie for dessert. It is delicious!  The crust is flaky. As we say in the south, ""It's so good it makes you want to slap your momma.""  (That's a compliment.) 
A few days later we were going to dinner with friends. They always want me to pick the place. I chose this little gem. My husband ordered fish tacos. You get two in an order. They come with large chunks of fish. The tacos taste fresh and really it the spot. I ordered the Talapia with the lemon and caper Piccata sauce over rice. There were 3 big pieces of fish. They were cooked and seasoned well. The Piccata sauce was on point. I almost licked the plate. It came with asparagus and it was wimpy as it was earlier in the week. For dessert I had chocolate pie. It was the real deal old school kind. It also had the scrumptious flaky crust. 
Everyone looks bed their food. We had a great dinner. 
I was disappointed that they don't take reservations but the woman I talked to said that she would put us on the call list under my name. One set of friends got their before me and we were not on the list. They put us on the list.  Thankfully they were seated right before my husband and I got their at the exact time I had requested."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"Yes.  Yes.  And Yes.  5 stars.  My dad, who lives in Missouri, said that the next time that he was in town that he wanted to have real Mediterranean food.  He and my mom were here over the weekend so we took them to Alihan's.  We went for lunch on Sunday.  There weren't very many patrons but I think it's because everyone was headed to the Pirate game.  
My husband and I ordered Mixed Kabobs.  It has all of their meat and chicken choices for two people to share.  Needless to say that the platter was huge!!  I think we might have drooled a little.  It was definitely filled with meats along with two types of rice and side salads.  You almost didn't know where to start.  I started with the chicken and went from there.  Each meat was seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly.  I couldn't stop eating the white rice and my husband chowed on the other reddish rice.  I'm not a big fan of rice but for some reason I loved this rice.  The salad gave you a nice crunch to go along with your meal.  I couldn't pick a favorite meat because they all had such different flavors.  We got my son's girlfriend to try lamb.  She is a majorly picky eater but really enjoyed the lamb.  That speaks volumes.  
My mom had the Eggplant Parmesan.  I snuck a taste before she took her first bite.  WOW!  The eggplant isn't fried at all like it usually is at other places.  There were nice bites of mozzarella layered in as it was built almost like a lasagna.  The sauce was incredible.  It was very flavorful but not overpowering.  I thought my mom was going to actually lick the plate which is very unlike her.  
My dad had the Shrimp and Seafood Ravioli.  I didn't taste the shrimp but I had one of the ravioli.  They are pillows of goodness covered in a rich creamy white sauce.  It is probably one of the best seafood dishes I have ever had.  Despite the heaping amount of food in one bite it still seemed light.  I actually wanted to take some of the sauce from my mom's dish and some from my dad's and mix them.  I think it would have made a third delicious sauce.  
Our service was on point.  My parents LOVED their food.  They said it was one of the best meals that they have had.  I can't wait to take others there to try it."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"I just visited this restaurant for the first time.  It used to be located downtown but relocated to the suburbs recently.  A friend of mine asked if we could meet there for lunch.  It is located in a very small plaza that I had never been to before.  Let me say first and foremost that the best thing about this restaurant is the service.  It was hands down some of the best service that I have ever received in a restaurant.  The menu looked very promising.  It had a lot of entrees that I really like.  Then I heard the specials and knew exactly what I wanted-the Salmon Piccata.  I chose to have wedding soup along with it.  First to our table was a nice basket of bread.  I nibbled on it until my friend go there.  It was very fresh.  My friend recommended that we order the Fried Zucchini as an appetizer.  When it came to the table it was a mountain of zucchini.  It was fried in a very very light breading.  It was crispy and the perfect consistency for the zucchini.  We were also given a bowl of marinara sauce.  It was very good.  It was a nice blend of seasonings.  It didn't require any tweaking with salt, pepper, or anything.  It wasn't too tomato-y.  It was perfect the way it was served.  The portion was so huge that we only ate half and took the rest to go.  Unfortunately I took the picture after we had eaten a bit of it so you don't get to see how big it really is.  I would definitely recommend it as well as order it again.  My wedding soup came and it was a great temperature-hot but not too hot to eat.  The stock is very flavorful.  Again, no need to add any salt or pepper.  There were a lot of little meatballs and bits of shredded chicken.  I would order it as part of my lunch or dinner.  It's a definite winner in my book.  Then my salmon came to the table.  It was not cooked as a piccata.  Instead it came out prepared differently.  My server offered to take it back and have it remade but it looked nice so I decided to eat it as it was prepared.  The salmon was cooked nicely.  It was a bit much with the amount of roasted red peppers it had so I pushed some of them to the side.  We didn't have dessert because we were too full.  I will go back soon to try some of their other dishes."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"I have stayed in hundreds of hotels. After awhile they all start to look the same. Every once in awhile you stay in a hotel that is different-sometimes for good reasons and sometimes for not so good reasons. This hotel is memorable and all for GREAT reasons. 
We had been driving through snow so when we pulled up to this older hotel that is painted dark gray with some bright yellow chairs on the front porch it made me smile. This hotel is an original. It has a history. The owner has remodeled it so that while most things are new there is still great character everywhere. The main lobby has couches, chairs, a big trunk for a coffee table, and an enormous fireplace. I actually had time to sit in that area this morning. It was cozy and welcoming. I could have stayed all day. 
One of the details I love is how the room numbers are painted on the door. They are big and graceful. Very eye catching. In the room the bathroom has the roller barn door and the shower is done in white subway tiles. There was a nice robe hanging by the door with an extra hook for coats. There was a cool chair to sit in. We had a King bed that was super comfy. There was a small coffee station with a bench underneath. There was also a nice desk with a chair that was flanked by tall cabinets. One held a small fridge and one had ironing stuff in it. The room was small but I loved everything about it. 
The hotel has a bar, a restaurant, and conference rooms. They are all nicely decorated and have tons of windows. If I lived close I would definitely use this venue for showers, luncheons, and many other types of get togethers.  
I also loved the indoor pool. It was huge. I got up and walked over to swim laps. I was the only one there at first but others came to swim. If you are a member of the community you can purchase a membership. The people that came were nice and everyone shared lanes. There were towels as well as tables and chairs. It was nice and warm in the huge room despite all of the snow outside. The pool was heated which was wonderful. 
I will definitely come back and stay here. I've already been telling my friends about it. People are always looking for a nice place to get away and this is a great place for that."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"For years I have had a routine when grocery shopping.  I start at Aldi's, then go to Trader Joe's, and then fill in from Giant Eagle.  I had read two reviews of this Market-one not so great and one that gave them a huge thumb's up.  I thought it would be cool to some day do all of my grocery shopping in just one or two stores and not three, but I went in cautiously.  I grabbed the sale ad and checked it out.  I actually got some great deals on seedless watermelon, cantaloupe, fresh green beans, yogurt, and a cleaning product that I use.  I ran into a friend of mine and we started talking about our families. We also talked about the market.  It was her first time visiting it also.  Every couple of aisles we would run into each other and talk about our ""finds"" or disappointments.  The ""finds"" were definitely some great sale prices.  However, the regularly priced items were 2 to 3 dollars higher than prices I typically paid.  Items like ice cream, vitamins, and some of the meats for example.  I basically felt like I was in a Trader Joe's but with Whole Food prices.  I wasn't a big fan of the bulk section but I did see a few people shopping their.  The juice bar seemed to be a hit but I didn't want to stand in line for it.  What I decided is that this will be the store I go to for ready made meals to heat and eat or meat that has already been seasoned/marinated and was ready to grill.  Other than that I don't see it fitting a need for our family.  Plus when we went to check out the lines were very long.  They kept calling up cashiers and baggers but it was going to take them awhile to get those lines through,  While I waited in line my husband checked out the wine and beer selection.  He said the wine selection was quite nice but the beer selection wasn't impressive.  When we were being rung up the cashier told us that by downloading the app we could get extra discounts on certain items.  On the app it shows you the item.  If you don't want it then you swipe it away.  Then only the discounts you want stay on.  It's a neat store but I think would have been nicer if the bulk area was re-located and an few tables and chairs were put their for people who wanted to sit and drink their juices, eat salads, or other prepared foods.  When we were checking out I did see a little cafe area but it was blocked off."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"First, let me be clear that I did not stay overnight at the hotel.  I was privileged to get a tour.  I am extremely glad I was able to tour it.  This hotel has SO much to offer.  Just walking in the door you can't help but be impressed immediately.  The decor is contemporary and industrial.  There is a mural behind the check in desk that has a bit of a 2D bridge.  It matches the bridge right outside the door.  It's the beginning of a full on textured experience.  There is a sleek sitting area in the shape of an ""S"" with chairs on either side.  In the middle of the lobby is a seating area with 2 couches, side tables, and a couple of chairs.  On one side of the lobby is a large community size table surrounded by chairs.  If you need a business area there is a small table with a couple of computers to meet your need.  On the lobby wall, which is one of the outside walls, is a large TV and fireplace.  The best part though was that through out the lobby there are actual pieces of old steel mills.  It is very cool because when you think of steel mills you think of smoke stacks.  These pieces allow you to get a better ""view"" of what types of equipment were actually inside the mills.  Pittsburgh is very proud of it's steel mill history.  The city was built on a steel foundation.  In the past few years Pittsburgh has gone through an identity change and now is known for it's technology.  We have attracted large tech companies such as Google. So this hotel is a perfect representation of PIttsburgh""s history and it's future.  I love the whole idea of that.  The hotel is PET FRIENDLY.  They have a lovely outdoor seating area with a fireplace right outside the lobby.  On the top floor there is a nice work out room.  You can see it on the way to the. . . . ROOF TOP BAR!  The view is incredible!!!!  The young lady, Jess, who gave us the tour will be one of the bartenders at the roof top bar.  The bar offers standard national beers as well as local craft beers.  The hotel also has a banquet facility. If you held a function in the banquet facility it would be easy for your guests to get in and out quickly. There is a restaurant on the main floor of the lobby-Eliza.  We ate lunch there and I did a review for that as well.  Hotel Indigo is a boutique hotel. It is locally owned.  The hotel is officially open!!  Tell all of your friends or family who are visiting the Burgh!!"
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"I had the opportunity to visit Drybar this week.  Drybar doesn't cut or color hair.  It's mainly for blow outs but they also do some up do's and braiding.  The salon is very inviting.  When you walk in you just do a happy sigh and your body relaxes because you know that you are about to get pampered.  After checking in I was offered a glass of champagne.  Yes, please!  They only serve one glass but if you are there with a wedding party or birthday party you and BYOB.  The salon has thought out to the most minute detail.  It is 90% white with pops of bright yellow.  Their is an very cool light fixture when you walk in that is made up of blow dryers.  All of the styling tools are gray and yellow.  Even the brushes are gray and yellow.  
I met my stylist and she took me back to her chair.  She explained their services to me and gave me a ""Look Book"" to choose a style.  The ""Look Book"" has about 10 or styles to choose from.  I asked the stylist, Diana, to choose for me.  She picked the ""Mai Tai"".  It is soft loose curls also known as a beachy wave.  Then she took me back to be shampooed.  It was super relaxing.  Then we headed back to the chair and she began to blow dry my hair.  I asked a lot of questions because I was unfamiliar with Drybar.  I learned that they are a national chain.  The stylists go to a special Drybar ""school"" where they learn each look in the Look Book.  They all have to do them exactly the same.  So if you like getting blow outs at Drybar but are traveling, you can search for one near you and know that you will be getting the exact same style as you do at your Drybar at home.
Drybar makes and carries their own hair products.  My stylist explained each product as she used it.  The hairspray used at the end was light but smelled great.  One of the things I find interesting is that during the consultation you are facing a mirror but while they create your style you are turned away from the mirror.  Then, at the end, it's like a big reveal.  My stylist did a fantastic job on my hair.  I was extremely pleased.
Why go to a salon if you are not having your hair cut or colored?  To treat yourself!!  If you are headed to a wedding, or a special night out, or even just having a blah day and need a little pick me up.  A good blow out can last a couple of days.  It's four days later and my hair still looks great.  Check them out and ask for Diana!  You will be thrilled that you did!"
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"My hubby and I were heading to have lunch at Qdoba. When we got there- Surprise!!!  It was now a place called Burger 21. We had never eaten at a Burger 21 so we thought we should try it. 
Inside the restaurant is decorated with a very modern flair. I really liked it. There is a small area to order, a small milkshake bar area, a condiment and fountain drink bar along with booths and tables. We went to the desk to order. The offer a lot-burgers, dogs, salads, and milkshakes. I decided to try the ""Bacon Cheesy"" burger and my hubby ordered the ""Spicy Thai Shrimp"" burger. We each ordered a soda and we ordered a large fry to share. Our total was $25. We thought that was a bit pricy. Once you order you sit at a table and they bring you your food. 
When the food arrived they had made the wrong burger for me. Instead of ""the Big Cheesy"" I was given the ""BBQ Bacon"" burger. I like BBQ sauce so I ate it instead of sending it back. The burger was very good. It had lettuce, tomato, bacon, cheddar cheese, onion straws, and BBQ sauce. It was pink in the middle. (They asked me when I ordered if that was ok. I said yes.). It was better than a fast food burger but not as good as a Burgatory burger. 
My husband's burger was a fried shrimp patty, lettuce, tomato, Sriracha aioli, sesame Thai slaw, and pure Sriracha. However the shrimp burger was NOT spicy at all. 
The French fries were more like McD's and you have the option of getting sweet potato fries or a mix of both. 
I ordered an Oreo milkshake to go. It was a very creamy shake and I enjoyed it. 
There were no garbage cans but we felt awkward leaving our garbage on the table. One of the ladies had come by our table and had picked up my stuff when I was done, and a different lady picked up my husband's but we needed to throw our cups away. My husband ended up throwing his away in a trash can behind the counter. He didn't go behind the cabinet. You could reach it from the side of the cabinet. 
This is just a weird experience. It's almost like if you are going to order your food at a counter you need to be able to dispose of it. OR have a wait staff person come to your table and take your order and also remove your garbage. Plus there was a tip jar at the register. We did tip but again it was awkward. Also when we first got there a few employees were at the counters. Then there were no employees at all out front. That's why we had to find a garbage can on our own. 
I don't think it was a great enough experience to try a second time."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"The old saying, ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" applies to this place. I was trying to find a place to eat and decided to check out this place since it was close. By the name and location I made some assumptions about the restaurant. I thought it was going to be a pub type environment with pub type food. I was half right. It is a pub environment. The menu, however was not pub food. The entrees started at $20. So instead of burgers we had porkchops, steak salad, and chicken. 
When you walk in you walk right into the bar which takes up almost the whole bar side of the restaurant. You walk around the bar to the place to be seated in the dining area which has 6 tables. It is very dark because the ceiling tiles are painted black with Christmas lights poked through. There are cloth table clothes which should have been the giveaway that this was not pub food. 
We ordered drinks. I am not a tea connoisseur but the tea was awful. It was from a bar tap or mixed out of a can in the back. It was not fresh brewed. My meal started off with the salad. It was covered in red onion. Big chunks and thin slices. There were 2 black olives, a tablespoon of shredded carrots, and a big portion of iceberg lettuce. I had asked for it not to have tomatoes. I asked for Bleu Cheese dressing. It was as thin as water. It had hardly any taste. One of the people with me got wedding soup that was very delicious. 
I ordered a dish I hadn't heard of before called Chicken Martini. It was chicken medallions breaded with Parmesan cheese that were cooked until golden on the stove and then baked in the oven. The chicken was a golden brown with a white cream type sauce over it. The chicken was tender but it tasted like you were eating a mouth full of cheese. I love cheese but this was too much. I used a lemon wedge from my tea to squeeze on the chicken to give it a brightness. 
I tried the pork chops and they were cooked perfectly. If you go I would highly recommend them. The steak on the steak salad was also nicely done and there was a lot of it. It also came with some very tasty garlic bread. 
We were definitely the youngest diners in the restaurant by at least 10 years. It made me want to call the guy, Robert, who does the restaurant makeovers. He would take it from the dark place that it is and bring the decor into 2016. They would draw a younger crowd. You need younger diners for when the seniors aren't able to dine out anymore. They have a good menu and most of the food is good. Sometimes you sacrifice environment for food. This was one of those times."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"We decided to go to the grand opening of Mindful today. We went at lunch hoping it wouldn't be as crowded as it would be in the evening. We chose to sit in the restaurant and we were seated immediately. The restaurant was only half full. There are a lot of options on the menu-starters, pizza, and wings to name a few categories. We started with an order of bone in wings. You can also get boneless if you prefer. It took about 30 minutes to get them. They were crispy, which I love, with the sauce served on the side. We ordered Garlic Parmesan but it tasted like clarified butter with no hints of garlic or parm. 
It took another 30-45 minutes to get our food. I ordered the Plain Jane burger with Gorgonzola cheese, lettuce, pickles, and bacon. The top of the bun looked burnt. The top of my burger also looked burnt. The inside of the burger was almost red. It was very dry. The bacon could have been cooked a little bit longer. I ate 1/4 of it and left the rest. The French fries were bordering on cold so I didn't even try one. 
The fish sandwich was good. It was a nice size piece of fish. The tarter sauce was homemade and it was very tasty. Some might prefer a little pickle in it but I liked it the way it was. The fish came with tortilla chips. Their version of tortilla chips is large triangles of fried dough. They are house made. I didn't care for them at all. 
We heard from people around us that they waited an hour for their food. One guy waited over 40 minutes for a Chicken salad. Some might think they would keep the beer flowing to take your mind off of the long wait for food but it was difficult to find your waiter and then it took over 15 minutes to get a beer. We were there for 3 hours and was only offered water refills once. And it's probably a good thing to not drink a lot because on the first floor the men's and the women's bathrooms have only one toilet. At one point there was a line for the women's room. 
We had two friends come in to check it out and we invited them to sit with us.  They ordered a Hummus plate and a chicken sandwich. After 45 minutes of waiting they cancelled their food order. 
On the ground floor is the restaurant on one side and the bar on the other. On the top floor their is another bar with less selection and is a seat yourself area. I'm not sure if you could order food from that area or not. They also have a small outside patio on the top floor. 
I know that it was their grand opening and grace should be given but we knew that they had done 5 private openings before opening to the public. That is more than enough times of practicing to get things right for a Grand opening. The two stars is for their beer selection.  It was the only highlight of the trip."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"If I could give this store ten stars I would do so!  I had been in a year ago to check out this store when I was in the area and was very impressed with it.  However, recently there was a Yelp event there and I got to actually experience what they do in the store.  Individually we made a coaster that had a decal of the city skyline.  We were given directions, tools, and materials.  They have community type tables and I was able to sit with a few other women.  We chatted while we were putting our coasters together.  It was interesting to see how we were all given access to the same materials and how different everyone's turned out.  Your individuality really shines through.  I'm not a very creative person but the space you in is very inspiring.  As a group we made a very large piece of art.  It was many layers and included a stencil decal.  It, too was our city's skyline.  We are Pittsburghers and we LOVE our city!  We are PROUD of our city!  So, we love anything to do with our city.  It was very cool how we were given a picture to guide us but our piece didn't have to look identical.  We could be creative and make it however we wanted to.  I jumped in to help sand.  We were using a huge wooden board instead of a canvas.  It was so big that up to three people could work on it at one time.  After I helped to sand I started laying the first layer of paint.  We were given different colors.  We splattered them, brushed them, and even used our fingers to paint with them.  Every person approached the ""canvas"" differently.  It was so interesting to see.  It definitely was a team building experience.  Everyone got along and we let everyone ""do their thing"".  The end result was a true piece of art.  Everyone loved it.  That doesn't happen often.  I think the employees are so encouraging and the space was so inspiring that there is no such thing as ""doing it wrong"".  We had put our names in the drawing and one of the ladies won and was able to take home the piece of art.  I was a little envious.  However, while spending time working on my coaster and on the group piece I really started to think of all of the ways you could bring together friends, teams, or groups together for a fun experience.  They are willing to help you make anything you would like to make.  If you go in and talk to them and show them your idea they will do their best to help you make it happen.  They also offer projects there that you can make that range in price so it's affordable for anyone.  I learned that they do a great event for Mother's Day.  Next year I'm asking my family to join me in experiencing that event as my Mother's Day gift.  They have other special events as well such as Star Wars, Harry Potter, and others.  Don't wait!  Go get your art on!"
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"I had seen the commercials on TV for Duluth and while they were humorous they also peaked my curiosity of the quality of clothing. Today I got to visit an actual Duluth store. We were greeted by a very nice gentleman. Throughout our visit we were approached by employees who asked us if we needed help. They weren't pushy, just very friendly. I noticed that a healthy portion of their employees were senior citizens. I really appreciated that.  
The store is extremely clean and organized. When you walk in you see women's clothes on the left side of the store and men's on the right. I chose to head left and venture through the ladies clothing. I was happy to see that their sizes range from extra small to 2X. The clothing is a lot of solid colors-mostly neutral with a few pops of color. They are extremely well made. It makes me think of the Gap on steroids.  They have some cute accessories like hats, purses, and scarfs. They also carry 2 lines of underwear. No thongs here-bikini, high cut, and briefs are their offerings. I had heard the underwear is nice so I bought a pair to try. (Price $18 for one pair). The men's underwear followed. Their underwear section is huge compared to the women's. I picked up two pair of the men's underwear-one each for my boys. I found it interesting that while the colors of the women's underwear had a couple of basic colors-mauve, purple, black to name a few. The men's had tons of colors ranging from black to vibrant colors as well as patterns. 
The next section was shoes. They are geared for outdoor wear-hiking, gardening, and traveling. They were not my cup of tea but would be for those that enjoy the outdoors. I skipped the men's section of shoes because I knew they weren't the styles that my guys like to wear. 
There was a nice section in the back with a tv, bottled water, coffee, a tv, along with a water fountain and water bottle filling fountain. The bathrooms are also in that area. 
They carry a nice selection of backpacks, gym type bags, and tool bags. They are all neutral colors of black, army greens, and browns. What surprised me was how light weight they are. They are very durable but still light weight. 
I went through the men's wear rather quickly. Our family is not super outdoorsy so I knew the guys in my family wouldn't be interesting. On the other hand they would be perfect for my dad. The closer I got back to the front of the store I saw a few things my guys would wear. I found some shirts I thought my guys would wear. They were around $40. I found some shorts for my hubby but they were $74. 
Overall I think it's a pretty good store. The clothes are very well made. You are definitely paying for quality.   It definitely is geared for people who work and play outdoors. I will probably go in for basics or gifts for my dad. I just have to budget for those trips. Today I spent over $60 for 3 pair of underwear. I normally pay around $6 a pair. That's a big difference."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"I was meeting my friends for dinner and we wanted to try this restaurant because it was new. I LOVE Mexican food. In fact this was my 3rd time this week for having Mexican food for dinner. I was psyched to try it. 
When we got there the place was packed. That's impressive for a Thursday night. Of course it's new and everyone wants to try the new place. We were seated quickly. We were given a table by the front windows. They had them open because it was such a nice night. We started looking at the menus and chatting. It took over 15 minutes for someone to come and take our drink orders. About the same time someone else brought us chips and salsa. For 4 people they brought 2 baskets of fresh made chips and two small dishes of salsa. It was very good. It also gave us something to snack on until our drinks came another 15 minutes later. A half an hour to get something to drink is ridiculous. We didn't even order anything from the bar. It was soda, water, and tea. The waiter took our order and we started chatting. There are big TVs everywhere. We watched the pirates lose and then watched the hockey game start (Game 5 of the Stanley Cup). We chatted and did some catching up. I didn't time it but it was over half an hour to get our food. It was probably more like 45-1 hour but I'm being generous and saying at least 30 minutes. 
It was rather confusing because there were 2 guys & one chick working our area. We weren't really sure who out actual waiter was. We had to flag one of the 3 down to get refills on our drinks. They got one of our orders wrong. It was completely wrong. One of my sides was wrong. I didn't send it back but it was frustrating. 
I had the Chicken and Lime tacos. It had chicken, guacamole, lime and cilantro rice and shredded cheese on two corn taco shells. I don't know what it was but something on the tacos was super sweet. I wondered if they had added sugar to the guacamole or rice instead of salt. You couldn't taste lime, cilantro or guacamole-just sweetness. I ate my side of beans to cut the sweetness. 
We flagged down a waiter for dessert menus. He kept telling us they were on the menus at the far end of the table. We kept telling him they weren't. Finally a friend picked one up and showed him. Then he said, "" Oh, they are on the other menus."" and walked away.  About 20 minutes later he came back to see if we were ready for our checks. We told him that he never brought us dessert menus. He went and got them but by that time we just wanted to leave. It was amazing the lightning speed in which he gave us our checks and brought us our change.  We never complained about anything except my friend who's order was completely wrong and even then she simply said, ""this isn't what I ordered."" (In a very nice way.). 
The whole experience was disappointing. I did taste my friends Enchiladas Verde and they were excellent. Poor service and food that tastes more like dessert than dinner it what got them 2 stars. I hope as they are there longer that their service improved greatly or people will not come back."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"I've had this place bookmarked and was wanting to go. I was super excited when my hubby told me that we had reservations there for Valentine's Day. 
We checked with the hostess and she seated us at a table for two. There were tables for two on each side of us. The table at the window was empty. Our first mistake was not asking to be moved there. It was empty the whole time we were there. Instead we had couples on both sides of and it felt like we were a table of 6. No privacy. No romance. We had high hopes for the food which was the second mistake. We ordered a breadbasket and a bowl of olives. The bread basket had several different types of bread. It came with a small container of honey and a small container of peppers and onions. The types of bread were explained to us which was nice. My husband enjoyed the peppers and onions mixture. I was having butter. It was a great consistency but was sweet. I wasn't expecting sweet butter. The bowl of green olives (with pits) had olive oil, lemon, and oregano. They were definitely one of my top two foods I had for dinner. They give you a small dish to put your pits in. It was a nice touch. 
For dinner we both went with the specials. My hubby ordered the pork w/mashed potatoes and I ordered the filet and shrimp which came with potatoes and green beans. I tried my husbands pork and his mashed potatoes. The pork was good but a smidge underdone. His mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth. The gravy was nice also. It was dark and rich and the right consistency. 
My potatoes were a tall stack of thinly sliced potatoes. It was cubed. I divided the tall stack into 3 small stacks. The stack that had been the bottom had potatoes that were almost raw. The next stack I tried was the middle and the potatoes were cooked a little but still close to raw. There was no seasoning on them. No salt, pepper, or anything. So basically a stack of raw(ish) and tasteless potatoes. The green beans were cooked correctly but the ends had been left on. I've never eaten somewhere that didn't break or chop off the ends. My second favorite food was the shrimp. I think they had been butter poached but I'm not sure. They were a nice size and consistency. The filet was ok. I thought there was a bit too much char on it and it didn't have much taste. I was super disappointed. 
For dessert we also went off the menu and I ordered the hazelnut chocolate dessert. It was pretty to look at-a small chocolate done with a swirl of caramel on the plate. It had chopped hazelnuts sprinkled on top. When you opened the dome there was a mousse inside that was more like ice cream than mousse. Doesn't that sound delightful???  It was not. I don't know how you can put chocolate, hazelnuts and caramel together and have it come out bland but it was. I even had my husband try it. 
The 3rd and biggest mistake I think we made was ordering the specials instead of off the menu. IF I were to go back it would be to try a few menu items. That's a big IF. The best thing about our dinner was our waiter. He did a great job and it's because of him that I'm giving the 3rd star. Otherwise there would only be two."
5JVY32_bmTBfIGpCCsnAfw,"We heard that his restaurant had opened even though the hotel (Hotel Indigo) wasn't open yet.  We decided to give it a try.  BEST. DECISION. EVER.  The restaurant  was empty when we went in at lunch time but then more diners came in after us.  The restaurant is gorgeous.  It's very contemporary, industrial, and now.  We were greeted with the door to the restaurant being opened for us.  We were quickly seated.  The decor is a mix of blues, oranges, browns, and industrial materials.  The art on the walls is all about the Burgh but from a very different perspective.  There is a very nice outdoor seating area.  There is a big community table near the bar. The lighting is a mix of contemporary (the bar lights) and the lights over the community table are industrial.  The colors and the look of the restaurant pull you in.  We were given menus and there was a nice selection to choose from.  I went with the Scottish Salmon.  The hubby went with the Club sandwich.  We decided to start with Brussel Sprouts as a starter.  I'm not a huge brussel sprout fan but these were roasted and topped with a little shaved Parmesan cheese.  There is a lemon aioli served beside it and it was a wonderful companion to the sprouts.  The portion is huge so you might want to share with two to four people.  The club sandwich was also very large.  It had huge slices of fresh tomato and fresh avocado.  The bacon on the sandwich has a rich smoky flavor that adds to the taste.  It also had an Amish white cheddar that played nicely into the bite.  You have a choice of fresh cut fries or a side salad to go with the sandwich.  You also have the choice of doing half a sandwich and a cup of soup.  I had the salmon and I really didn't want to share.  It is a nice cut of salmon that is placed on top of asparagus, mushrooms, and Carolina Gold rice.  The salmon was cooked perfectly as was the asparagus.  Asparagus is my favorite vegetable and some places just can't get it right.  Here-they nailed it.  It was the Carolina Gold rice that sealed the 5 star deal.  I don't know what it is made with but oh my goodness, it is like liquid gold.  I could have eaten just a plate of that although you might die from the richness.  Not wanting to stop the party, I ordered Blueberry Creme Brûlée.  It was the perfect ending to the meal.  My husband is not a Brûlée fan but he enjoyed it.  The blueberries were fresh and whole.  They were just a blend swirled in.  Of course we all know that the way to know Brûlée is on pointe is if you hear the cracking sound when you put your spoon through it.  The cracking was loud and proud.  Our server, Lana, gave us VIP service.  Toward the end of our meal a very nice woman named Liz came to our table and chatted with us.  We asked if we could see the lobby of the hotel.  She told us that the hotel was actually open.  She asked if we would like a tour of the hotel.  YES!!!  So the bartender, Jess, took us on a tour once we were done eating.  I found out later that Liz is one of the owners.  This was one of the best dining experiences I have had.  The restaurant is in the middle of a technology park and part of a hotel and that may make some people think they want to pass because sometimes hotel restaurants aren't that great.  No matter where you live in the city, you need to go and check out this restaurant.  It is easy to get to and you will be glad you did."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"We've lived in the area for over a year and this was our first visit to this Red Robin. Reading the reviews I wasn't really sure what we were going to get but this ended up being such a great experience!

Granted, we went at around 8pm on a Monday night, so the place was pretty slow. In fact, I believe there were maybe 5 other tables occupied in the entire place. 

So when we first walk in, we are greeted at the door and seated by the greeter and less than 2 minutes later we are greeted by our server, Steven. We order our drinks and Steven mentions a few suggestions since we had mentioned this was our first visit here. Upon his recommendation I ordered the Royal Red Robin burger(10.49), while my friend ordered the Chili Cheese burger (9.99). Both burgers came with ""Bottomless steak fries"". They do give you the option to switch those out with a different style of fries, if you wish. We stuck with the steak fries and figured we'd just go with that. 

I had been craving a burger all day, so sinking my teeth into that tasty burger was sweeeeet! Very fat and juicy! Plus I love the over-easy egg on top! That was the first time I had tried that on a burger and I definitely enjoyed it! The steak fries were the thick cut variety (which I love) and were pretty tasty as well. After 2 servings, that seemed to be plenty for me. My friend seemed to thoroughly enjoy his chili cheese burger and also indicated other burgers on the menu he wanted to try out on future visits.

The service was great! It was perfect that Steven was attentive and brought refills in such a timely fashion! He repeatedly checked in on us and attended to our needs during the meal. Just because a place is slow doesn't necessarily translate to great service. Trust me, I've experienced that first hand many times. But that certainly wasn't the case here! In fact everybody here was so friendly, we even had 2 other employees wish us a good night as we were heading out of the place. We were both like, ""Damn""! lol 

I honestly can't think of a reason why this wasn't a 5 star experience. It was pretty much a flawlessly pleasant experience and we will DEFINITELY be back for multiple visits! I just hope future visits are as good, they've set the bar pretty high for themselves.

So, based on my experience, I have to give Red Robin..

5 stars!"
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Hugo's Cellar came highly recommended by a couple of very good friends. So when the opportunity arose to finally experience it, we jumped at it! 

Located in the basement level of the Four Queens Casino downtown, you would never imagine such a place would be found here!

Items Ordered:

- New York Strip Steak 16 oz. (medium) ($58)
(included: table side salad, garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables, and chocolate dipped strawberries)
- Diet Coke ($3)
- Three Layer Cake ($7)

New York Strip Steak, 16 oz. (5/5) Steak was very thick and juicy and cooked to perfection! Absolutely delectable!

The garlic mashed potatoes (4/5) did not disappoint as well. I just wish the portion size was a tad bit greater, but still, they were very good!

The table side salad (4/5) was a real treat in itself! I opted for the Caesar dressing with some shrimp, croutons, parmesan, and tomatoes. Very tasty and great portion size! Not a tiny salad by any means!

Chocolate dipped strawberries (5/5) were a great treat after the main course! Strawberries were HUGE! I could have had a couple more of these!

- Three layer cake (4/5) was a very satisfying way to complete the meal. Not too sweet, but very delicious! Also was the perfect portion size, as I was stuffed after the main course!

Service (5/5)  Absolutely charming and attentive service! Some of the staff have fantastic stories about some famous people who have dined here in the 70's and 80's! It just adds to that classic, old school vibe that I absolutely love!

My only complaint was with how the deserts were presented. I was led to believe that the desert was part of the main entree due to the fact that the waiter approached us and just told us to pick one. Every other steakhouse I've been to will ask if you wish to have desert before asking you to just ""choose"" one. I was so stuffed by the awesome steak and potatoes that I probably would not have had desert otherwise. It's not  huge thing, but I didn't care for that. (minus 1/2 star)

Ambiance (4/5) Classic, old school feel to the place. All of the waitstaff were in tuxedos. The room was tastefully decorated. Ladies were given long stemmed roses. Great little touches led to a fantastic atmosphere!

This was a great experience and I will be sure to recommend Hugo's Cellar to others as it was recommended to me!

4.5 stars!"
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"I recently rejoined LVAC after an over 4 year break. 24 Hour Fitness was adequate, but honestly was never that great. When I recieved an offer in the mail to rejoin for $144 for the entire year, I jumped on it. After all, I was paying $35 a month at 24 Hour Fitness. Well, today is 1 month to the day that I've been back and I felt the need to update my review. 

The Positives-
-Plenty of equipment, I mean like wayyyy more than any 24 I've ever stepped foot into
-The place is kept fairly clean too. That is even more impressive considering the volume of people that come here on a daily basis
-Right off the freeway, its easy to get to from anywhere in town, plus Its about 5 minutes from my house :)
-Th cardio section is great and I always seem to be able to get on a treadmill when I go(again, is miraculous considering how busy this place always seems to be) I love the TVs on the treadmills. I love to watch ESPN or ESPN2 while I get some cardio in. Its a great distraction from the torment I'm currently inflicting upon myself.

The Not-so-positives-
- Holy crap! Is this place ever NOT busy?? Seriously?? For the most part I try to avoid peak times...but it always feels like peak time here. 1pm on Saturday? Busy. 10pm on Thursday? Busy. Damn people. Go home. lol It is incredibly annoying to have to go to your 3rd, 4th, or sometimes even your 5th option of exercise you want to do because the first 2-4 are being used by someone else. And this seems like it happens ALL THE TIME! 
-The employees seem pretty indifferent, for the most part. I can't say anybody has been rude...and a couple of them are quite nice...but you're lucky if you can get a ""Hi"" out of most of them. I don't really mind. Just don't expect much.

..and I can't really fault the club for this one..but it seems a bit worse at this gym.
-Why do alot of people not have respect for other peoples personal space?? There is a lot of attitude being rocked around this place. 
and another one..
-why don't people re-rack their weights? AND in the proper place! Don't put the 40'sbetween the 80's and 90's, you numbnut! Basic gym etiquette, people. 

With all that being said, I am going to keep it at 4 stars for now, although I honestly think 3.5 may be more accurate. I still do like this place alot better than 24 and the price can't be beat.

4 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"I wanted to wait a week or two before leaving this review so I could see how my car was responding to their care.

Instead of going through a long winded review of my experience here, I will use some bullet points to get the important points across.

Positives-

- Customer service was pretty good. Much better than the majority of auto shops I've been to in the past 10 years or so.
- I was approved for their Firestone Credit Card, which was running a promo of 6 months no interest(as long as the balance was paid off in 6 months). I didn't have to pay a penny out of pocket on the day of repairs.
-With approval of that card you get lifetime oil changes for like $17 and change at that location. A nice little perk..
- my car has been running well since my visit (*knocks on wood aggressively*)
- about an hour after my visit, my ""check engine"" light came on and they immediately took me back in and ran a couple of tests before just switching off the light. I appreciated the swift response.


Not so much-

- I paid $180 for them to find an oil leak and fix it, than roughly $200 for a tune up which was going to be due soon.  I am fine with the cost of the oil leak fix, but I feel like the tune up was a bit on the high side...I cant help but wonder if  I should have shopped around, but also just wanted it to be done and over with
- when I was asked if I wanted to apply for the card, I initially told them ""no thanks"" because I didn't want the inquiry to ding my credit rating. I was assured that it was a ""soft"" inquiry and would not affect my credit rating. Not true. It IS a hard inquiry that dinged my credit rating. Granted it only brought it down 4 points, but it was annoying since I actually expressed this concern before applying.
- the wait took for-ev-er! I was in the office for about 6 hours initially. After I had to come back for the check engine light, it was another 45 minutes. I aged sitting there. Not good. I'm already old! :P As long as the job is done right though, I can deal with this..


All in all, it was an ""okay"" experience and I will likely come back for the oil changes. I still prefer Professional Brake Service for brakes and Discount Tires for tires, but I may give these guys another shot at other repairs that don't fall under either one of those categories.....depending on the price...

3 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Thai St. Cafe is yet another very solid Thai spot just off the strip near Industrial and Desert Inn. You will actually find it very near the Can Can Room on the west side of Industrial Road. 

Items Ordered:

- Pot Stickers ($6.95)
- Pineapple Fried Rice w/chicken ($8.95)
- Boat Noodles ($10.95)
- Pork Laab ($8.95)

Pot Stickers (4/5) (6 Pieces per order) Tasty dumplings served with a sweet soy sauce. Plenty of meat and tasted great bathed in the sauce!

Pineapple Fried Rice w/chicken (5/5) Tasted very authentic and plentiful in portion size! (I was actually telling my friend that the way they cook their chicken and their rice greatly reminded me of this little hole in the wall place we went to a few times, just a block away from the Grand Palace. Ahhh, I miss that place!) The fried rice included ingredients you don't necessarily find in some more Americanized Thai spots like raisins and cashews. I look forward to other variations of this dish in the future. Maybe some duck fried rice will be next!

Boat Noodles (3/5) I've never had boat noodles before so I honestly don't have anything to compare it to. The broth was a bit sweeter than I probably would have preferred, but was still quite delicious! Again, no complaints about portion sizes here! They serve you the boat noodles in a big ole' bowl! Very filling!

Pork Larb (4/5) For starters, they give you almost 3 times as much larb as what I received at Lotus of Siam a few weeks ago. The spice level was on point and made it much more satisfying this time around! Definitely having this again!

(+) No MSG! 
(+) Enjoyed the decor and got a good chuckle out of those bathrooms signs! Reminded me of the ones I would see at some of the nightclubs/bars in Bangkok
(-) Service was spotty. The staff was nice, but we had to hunt the waitress down to get refills for our drinks and to get our bill. There was only 1 other occupied table besides ours, so I didn't quite understand why that was the case. It wasn't terrible though and it certainly won't deter me from coming back.
(-) not much available in the way of parking. Luckily we went during a slow time.

I really enjoyed my meal here today and I think I could even say it is in my ""top 3"" Thai places here in Las Vegas for the time being! I will certainly be back to try some more menu items!

Yay! I'm a fan!

4 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Really, this is a prefect example of when a 4.5 rating is a perfect fit for a business.

For the first time since turning 18, I had to have someone else do my taxes. This year brought on several things I was unfamiliar with, as far as how to file correctly.

Pros-

- These people are so friendly. Not your stereotypical cold, stuffy suits at all! Everyone from reception to the tax preparers were very genial and approachable. Spartak was the representative who assisted me and he was great!

- If there are any questions or concerns at all, they have a whole team of professionals with varying strengths that all work together to get the right information. I had questions regarding gift taxes and when Spartak wanted to make sure his information was corrected, all he had to do was IM someone on his desktop and someone was at the desk in a jiffy! Great communication between everyone in their office!

- They made a scan of all related forms/paperwork to my return and they keep it on file in the event that you should have any questions. They also neatly package your copies in a snazzy little folder for your own personal records.

Cons-

- I had to wait for about a full hour after my appointed time....and I got there 15 minutes early. Ugh. After waiting 45-50 minutes, Spartak did come out, apologize for the wait, and said he'd be ready in 2 minutes...but then it was another 15-20 minutes till I saw him again! lol 

- If you want to have your preparation fee taken out of your refund, it is a $40 fee. I opted to just pay outright for my fee that day.

From the information I gathered, they charge anywhere from $29-$169 for their services. With all the things involved in my return I was in the $169 club, but I still feel it was well worth it. 

I'm guessing the $29 fee is for a simple 1040EZ form. I'm shocked anybody would feel the need to pay to have someone fill out that simple 1 page form for them. I think I could tape a pen to my chihuahua's paw and he could manage to complete a 1040 EZ...but I digress..

I referred a friend to them and he went in several days later. His return was a lot less ""involved"" than mine, so he only paid $119. So apparently there is some sort of pricing ""scale""....

Overall, this is a great service run by friendly and highly competent reps. I definitely give it a big ole' thumbs up!

4.5 stars!"
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Wow.Just...wow.

Let me start by saying that I have done more than 400 reviews at this point and have only given out 20 1-star reviews. That is less than 5%. I am a pretty easy going and easy to please guy. Working with the public for more than 25 years and in casinos here in Las Vegas for more than 15 years, I like to believe I am very understanding as well. 

But after what I got here at Ellis Island today, I refuse to spend another red cent here ever again. What is more frustrating is that I have been a semi-regular patron of EI for over 10 years now. I have always sung its praises as a great hole-in-the-wall place to friends and when family would visit I would have them enjoy that tasty BBQ.

No more.

I came here today for the low key atmosphere. Played some slots(no luck there) and placed some sports bets(we'll see ;)....I than saw a few days ago that they had released some brand new $1 chips. I went to the cashier to buy 3 of them and was met with such a rude and snappy reply it really took me a second to process it. I'm sorry, are they made of gold?? What's with the attitude??

Now I understand many casinos do not want to ""sell"" casino chips, because they are made for table play. I get that. I understand that. Ever since I moved here in the late 90's I like to buy 2 or 3 chips from each casino as part of my personal collection. I am NOT a chip dealer. I do not sell them. It is simply something for my modest little collection. I could understand if I wanted to buy 20, 30, or 50...or whatever....but 3??? Really?? All that attitude and the short, curt responses were hardly necessary. 

In 15 years of doing this I have NEVER had a cage cashier treat me like the way she did today. This was an older lady working the cage around 11:30 this morning. Completely unnecessary and totally uncalled for.

I'm most annoyed I didn't hit the cage first because I  spent money in the machines and made some sports bets first. Had I experienced this first, I would have left immediately.

I can tell you one thing though. My 11 year love affair with Ellis Island is over. I will not be back and I will no longer bring friends and family here for the brews, bbq, slots, etc. I drive past too many other casinos to get there that will not treat me like asking for 3-$1 chips is a criminal offense.

1 star.

Welcome to the Hall of Shame."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Damn!

You read that right! ...DAMN!

I was tempted to leave that as my review, but I'll leave a bit more than that!

This place is like a slice of Meat Heaven! *Tip* Sign for for their email list on their website! They will periodically send you coupons and promotions for great deals here. I signed up about a week before my birthday and got a free meal for my birthday (when you are accompanied by a paying guest).

Now, it isn't exactly cheap at 46.99 per person, but there wasn't a nano-second where I felt it was anything less than totally worth it!

The service we experienced was fantastic! We walked in and spoke to the hostess at the entry and were seated within 5 minutes despite that fact that the place was quite busy (and this was on a Tuesday, to boot!). We were seated and our server, Amanda,  gave us a quick rundown on how things worked and she encouraged us to start off at the salad bar. We respectfully declined and let her know that they should just start sending the meat over to our table! I sure as heck didn't come here to fill up on rabbit food! (Although, I have heard great things about the salad bar from co-workers who have been, especially the lobster bisque).

The drinks came and they also serve you some garlic mashed potatos, fried bannana (to cleanse your pallet between meat servings), and we went thru a couple baskets of these cheese flavored bread balls! Those damn things were so tasty! I told myself I wouldn't fill up on sides, but I just couldn't stop munching on those things! I used those to cleanse my pallet! :P

The meats were freaking scrumptious! Again....DAMN! We made it a point to try everything ...twice...and my 3 faves I went for thirds! I pride myself on being a huge carnivore! My three faves? The pork BBQ ribs, the fillet mignon, and the sirloin! Mmmm, mmmm, MMMM!

After all that, I opted for some desert! They had a thick piece of chocolate cake that was sooo rich , but also sooooo good(8.00)...I can't believe I fould room for that after all the meats I had...but I managed! lol

After leaving here it should be noted that I was so full that I literally did not eat for about 18 hours!

I have to say I was beyond impressed with this place and we already can't wait to come back and enjoy this place again very soon! Great Food and  great service at a fair price! What more could you ask for?

5 stars!"
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Honestly, where do you even start when attempting to review the famed Las Vegas Strip??

When I made my first visit here in the late Nineties driving from Phoenix, I instantly was awed and captivated by this place. Even before laying eyes on the strip for the first time, I will always remember the glow of lights that was so visible from so far away. Seeing the Luxor light from afar before even knowing what it was. It was a transcendent moment for me when we drove over that hill and I saw all the bright lights and neon dancing in the night!

So much history has been etched on Las Vegas Boulevard. The names of the famous and infamous litter all of Las Vegas' rich and storied history. Legendary casinos come and go. The Sands, Dunes, Desert Inn, Stardust, Frontier, Hacienda have given way to the Mirage, Bellagio, Venetian, and Wynn.....which have paved the way for the next generation: The Cosmo, Aria, SLS, etc.

One thing that remains constant: This IS the entertainment capital of the world! Where else can you find some of the world's finest restaurants within walking distance to a Del Taco? Where else can you buy a $10,000.00 cocktail (Ono cocktail at XS) within walking distance to cheap drink specials ($1 Michelobs at the Casino Royale bar)? 

You have some of the worlds best entertainment here! Cirque Du Soileil, Le Reve, Jersey Boys, stand up comedy shows, variety acts, magic acts, and the list goes on and on! 

Yes, it's a total tourist trap. Who...Freaking...Cares?

Who can say they don't have some incredible memories of some kind on the Las Vegas Strip??

Plus the people watching is just off the charts! lol

You do have to watch out for the drunks, scam artists, druggies, overly intoxicated people, panhandlers, prostitutes, pimps, and other less-than-savory characters....but it's all part of the package. lol

- One memory I can share: I remember when I was driving to work on the strip(to a casino that is long gone *sigh*) when I had to wait at the Flamingo and LV Blvd. light for 15 minutes while several elephants walked down the closed strip to make their way to Thomas and Mack for Ringling Bros Circus show. That was a sight at 5 am!

Most other memories...I don't think would be appropriate to share in this review lol 

I love this place. I love this city! It's not perfect, but it can be a hell of a lot of fun!

Viva Las Vegas!



5 stars Baby!"
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"The real shame about this 2 star experience is that with very little effort it could have been a 4 star experience. 

Positives-

- the day crew was quite friendly from valet to front desk to waitress'
- the room was cozy, if a bit bland. good square footage. Includes a fridge, which was nice. Had a good nights sleep, as the bed was very soft and comfortable.
- found a machine that actually gave some great play and left me with a modest profit. Nothing to retire on, but had some fun with it.
- With each day you do get 1 free cup of coffee and 1 free alcoholic beverage. This was a nice little perk.

Negatives-

- the night crew was lazy, apathetic, and some were downright surly.
- Made the reservation a few weeks ago and requested a high floor. While I do understand it is simply a request, the place was not busy at all and the parking lot looked barren, so I figured my chances should be good to get a room on a high floor. When I asked the girl at the front desk about the request, she said the room was blocked and she could not move it. (Translation: too bad, I don't feel like messing with it). I ended up with a room on the 6th floor.  I worked hotel front desk and night audit in this town at MUCH bigger casinos and know that changing a room blocking for a 2 night stay on a slow night is childs play. May take upwards of 2-3 minutes. She simply did not want to be bothered. This just came across as lazy and apathetic.
- when I went to get my free beer at Marilyn's Lounge, the young lady working the bar was far more concerned with flirting with some bald dude playing the machine than helping a paying guest with tip in hand. I actually stood there for a few minutes before she graced me with her attention and finally got me the drink. Apparently this was a huge inconvenience for her. 
- the drink servers at night seem downright bitter and grouchy. Damn. Smile once in a while and be engaging. You work for tips. A bunch of ""wet blankets"".
- the food at both the buffet and cafe was pretty bad. Reviews to come..

I had reasonable expectations for the Eastside Cannery and, suffice it to say, was totally let down. Like I said at the beginning of this review, if the employees just acted like they cared a little bit and made even a little effort to make people happy, this could be a gem of a place!

It wasn't bad enough for the Hall of Shame....but I will not be back...

2 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Opening on December 28, 1996, The Orleans has been a locals staple in Vegas for almost 20 years now! How time flies!

  I have been a semi-regular patron of this casino for many, many years and feel there is a lot to love about this place!

I haven't actually stayed overnight, but did set up a room for a family member during his visit and have seen the inside of the rooms. I can say that this appears to be one of the greatest values for a room in the city! Only paying $45 a night or so for several nights was a steal! The room was very clean, had a great view, and was stocked with many great amenities. 

The great thing about the Orleans is that you could do so many things and not have to leave the property! In addition to gambling, eating, and drinking, you are also able to go bowling, see a movie, check out a concert or sporting event. All of this at a very affordable price!

I love the fact that The Orleans stays true to its cheesy little theme. So many casinos seem almost ashamed to have a theme not centered around sterile opulence. Not this casino! You have the statue of Big Al the Alligator and his jazz band at the entry, just for starters! I love the large, lighted masked heads over the pit, as well. When you check in or go sign up at the players club, you get those  little beaded necklaces! lol It's just cheesy and fun!

There are so many amenities I have enjoyed in my numerous visits here..

- They have a Century movie theater upstairs, just across from the arcade. It's not the best theater in the city, but far from the worst. I have taken in many movies here!
- their buffet is great for the price point! Prices start from only $8.99 and they even have the option to purchase an all day pass! More info here: http://www.orleanscasino.com/dine/french-market-buffet
- I have always gotten fun and friendly service at the bars here, especially at the Alligator Bar and Mardi Gras bar!
- They have a great sports book! Definitely the best one for a Boyd property!

Granted, the place can get pretty smokey. No argument there. You could find many places in town that are far worse, though.  Also, if you are coming here hoping to catch some nice eye candy, abandon that hope at the door. lol 

But with a ton of options for gambling, food, drink, and entertainment all at fair and affordable prices, what more could you ask for from a locals spot? I have been coming here for many years and will continue to be a loyal patron.

4 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Got a great deal to see the Titanic Exhibit, which is located on the mezzanine level at the Luxor Hotel and Casino.

I have been fascinated with the Titanic since I was a kid, long before this Jack and Rose crap. I remember way back in 1985, I had a subscription to National Geographic at the time and one month the cover featured the recently discovered remains of the ship on the ocean floor.  Ever since that moment, I have been hooked.

Positives-

- It was cool being assigned as an actual passenger on the ship and reading their specs. I went with 2 other people and we had fun with it. Plus at the end of the exhibition, you get to find out if you survived. (I did not...being a male on 3rd class didn't help matters, I'm sure)
- employees were very nice and engaging. Especially the girl who sold us the tickets and the young man who got us started and assigned us our passenger cards.
- Plenty of cool artifacts pulled up from the ocean floor...of course, seeing the piece of the hull is the highlight of the whole thing to me...the things it saw!
- the replica of the staircase is incredibly detailed and stunning in person! I opted for the souvenir photo. They charge $20 for the first one and $10 for each additional. 
- Reading all the stories of the passengers was fascinating as well, as I learned even more than I already knew..

Negatives-

-Easily my biggest gripe with this exhibit is the no pics rule! I love taking pics and I would have loved to snap away in here, but I opted to respect the rules and not try to sneak any in.
- This didn't bother me, but if doing some reading bothers you, you may not be too thrilled about the way this one is set up. Not nearly as much reading as, say, the Mob Museum..but reading all the personal stories of the passengers is a big part of the exhibit.

Other notes-

-They are open from 10 am- 10 pm everyday, but sell the last ticket at 9 pm. You really won't need much more than an hour tops to go thru and enjoy everything, IMO
- Prices are as follows..
$32.00 General Admission
$30.00 Seniors (65 and over)
$24.00 Children (4 - 12 years)
FREE Children (3 & younger)
$29.00 Locals (with valid id)

I enjoyed the exhibit a great deal, but I don't know if I would still feel that way if I had paid the full price. If you can get it at a discount or part of a package deal, then  I think it would be a good value.

If you have any interest in this infamous piece of history, you owe it to yourself to visit this exhibit at least once!

4 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"I actually ended up here by mistake and not paying attention to where I was going at the time. After reading these reviews, it looks like I dodged a bullet!

This is what happened..

I pull into a parking space at the gym yesterday and no sooner do I turn the car off and go to open the door,I hear a loud *CLICK* . I can't open my driver side door at all! You pull on the lever.....and not a damn thing happens!  I instantly knew it was not good! 

Two things about me-

1) I am not mechanically inclined

2) patience is NOT my virtue

So I want this thing fixed right away! The idea of having to constantly lower my window to reach outside and let myself out of my car is not very appealing to me. 

I did NOT want to go to the dealership, because we all know how fair pricing is at all dealerships everywhere. So I remembered the Brake place I went to last year in the ""Auto Mall"" on Silverado Ranch and Bermuda. I figure if they can't fix it maybe they can refer me to someone who can.

They refer me to the place next door. I guess I took a left when I should have taken a right. 

I have the guy look at it and he says they will look at it for $80. Great. Whatever. Just let me know what the damages will be..

He shows me where the door handle had a plastic piece on it that had broken and that it would have to be replaced. Wonderful. How much and how long?

I did have to wait an excrutiating 1 and 20 minutes for the part to be delivered (Again, patience is not my virtue), but they charged me 60.00 for the part (I saw later online it averages around 40.00..ok, I guess I could have been gouged much worse), plus that 80.00 was the labor. Basically I walked out the door for 150.00

That's no ""deal"", but while waiting in the lobby for 2 hours and reading these reviews on Yelp! I was basically p*ssing my pants! Pretty bad when standards are lowered to the point of ""please don't try to screw me too bad""! That's where I was at about 20 minutes into the process..

To their credit, they did take care of the problem, the lady at the desk was polite and cordial, and I can live with $150.00 so I will give them 3 stars for this review...

But in all honesty I feel like I dodged a bullet and got lucky with this one. Do I feel like I got taken? No. Would I come back? Hell no lol.. Next time if it's not a vital problem I will put on my ""patience pants"" (a friends little saying) and do my research before just pulling into somewhere and throwing my keys over the counter....

anyways...

3 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Being an unabashed carnivore who has a passion for the fascinating ,and sometimes sordid, history of Las Vegas, The Steakhouse at Circus Circus was a truly memorable experience that seems to have been tailor made for me!

(OK, I just flashed back to the Yelp! South Park episode where Kyle's dad goes into these long winded and terrifically verbose reviews. My bad.)

Anyways, back to this incredible experience! 

Having to navigate through Circus Circus and the hordes of kids was pretty annoying, but once you step through that archway it almost feels like you are being transported to a different time. They definitely kick up the a/c in there and you could feel it instantly!

The room is a throwback to classic, old school Vegas. I LOVE IT! Lots of dark oaks, dim lighting, and romantic music are some of the first things that hit my senses. The other thing....

...the incredible aroma of steak being perfectly cooked and marinated! Wow! It smelled so good in there! 

Nancy was our server this evening and she was outstanding! Very friendly and attentive service, without being at all intrusive. When we return(which is about a 100% guarantee at this point), we will certainly request her! 

We were seated promptly and within 2 minutes were brought a bread bowl with butter and served our drinks. Service was done in a very timely fashion very little lull between items. The bread was warm and soft, so the butter just melted perfectly inside. I didn't want to fill up on bread so I just had a couple of pieces.

As for the main course, we both opted for the New York Strip Steak ($56), which came with a choice of house salad or  black bean soup (I had the house salad) and garlic mashed potatoes or a baked potato. 

The garlic mashed potatoes were so good! Compared to the puny and bland portion we recieved at another strip restaurant the previous week, this really hit the spot!

But the steak! Oh, that NY Strip steak was so delectable! It was so tender and juicy, the knife just fell to the plate with ease with each cut. We were both wildly impressed with how flavorful it was! Without a doubt, one of the best steaks i've ever had in my life!

Service was beyond outstanding! Our glasses were never empty the entire meal! It really made the difference between having a good meal and an experience!

Nancy asked if we would like to have desert, but we were totally stuffed and had to throw in the towel at that point! But, rest assured, we will be back! Oh, we will be back!


5 stars! 
Woohoo! As good as it gets!"
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"I've lived in Las Vegas going on 9 years now and have never taken the opportunity to go atop the Eiffel Tower. Well, I had learned a few months ago that you can take a ride to the top for free on your birthday (with valid ID). So, while playing tourist on the strip on my birthday, I decided to check it out!

Located inside the Paris Las Vegas(duh), you will find the entry way to the ride not too far from the Race and Sports Book. You'll take an escalator upstairs and as you're walking along the pathway, someone will try to sell you a souvenir photo. We opted out. I am local and don't need to commemorate my trip to the top. Also, I am cheap.

Anyways, after reaching the end of the pathway you will wait in line to board one of the elevators to take you to the top. The day I went, the wait was roughly 10-15 minutes. 

We finally loaded on one of the elevators and took the ride up. The ""host"" (or whatever you'd like to call them) was friendly and informative. She started spitting out these stats and info about the Eiffel Tower(both here and in Paris) that I'm quite sure she could recount in her sleep. She actually had some personality though! She wasn't robotic and just ""go through the motions"".

Once you exit the elevator up top, you are welcome to walk anywhere on the platform, which covers all sides of the tower. Of course, the most popular area will be right where the elevator doors open as it faces the Bellagio/Cosmo area. It was kind of annoying never getting any great pics around that area since people would squat there waiting for the fountain show to play. So I opted to walk  around and check out other areas. You do get some great views of Planet Hollywood and the Paris its self. There are some great views of the north end of the strip as well, like Caesars and the Mirage and even the new High Roller observation wheel. 

The deck isn't as high as the Stratosphere observation deck, but then again, you get a much better view over here! There is so much more happening on this end of the strip! This is something you should do at least once just to experience it.

They are open from 9:30am-12:30am Monday through Friday and stay open till 1 am on the weekends. Standard pricing is $10.50 during the day and $15.50 at night for adults. Besides the birthday discount, they also offer free passes to U.S. military also(with ID, of course).

I went during the day, but I will definitely be back at night when friends or family visit just to take in the views at night! I bet that's a sight! 

4 solid stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Wow!

Best buffet I have ever had the ""button popping"" pleasure of experiencing! Living in Vegas, land of the buffet, I have certainly seen my share of buffets. 

My biggest regret here is that I ran out of stomach for all the tasty items that were available! They have over 500 options for you at any given point in time! I tried to keep the portions small, so I could taste as many different things as possible, but after 3 plates,an awesome dish of Rigatoni, and some deserts, I had to throw in the towel.

Everybody seemed to be mobbing the Seafood and Meat stations, so I started out with some Asian and Italian. The peppered beef was so tender and juicy and the orange chicken so full of flavor! Chicken skewers were second only to a friends Mom who makes  it homemade. That being said, they were great! The Peking Duck was pretty tasty as well! 

They had these sliders there that were rdeiculously good, and much meatier than I first thought! I wanted more of those, but had to try as many different things as I could. A must for my next trip here(which will happen soon!) You could tell presentation is a high priority  for the buffet as well, making it feel more like an experience and not just like ""just another buffet"".

During one of my trips to stock up on more food, I was at the Italian ""station"" and commented to my friend that the little deep dish rigatonis looked good, but it appeared as though it may have been there for a few minutes. Just as quickly as the last word slipped out of my mouth I see a hand pull that dish back and a second later a fresh staeming one slid right back in its place! lol Oh hell yea! Now THAT is service aimed at guest satisfaction!

The deserts were incredible as well! I hate to sound redundant, but this place is truly impressive. They had a selection of unique and exotic ice cream flavors, including Strawberry cheesecake. I enjoyed Watermelon Mint, and it was mighty tasty! 

Table service was great as well, Whenever I got up and left the table for another trip to the buffet, I always returned to a clean table with dirty plates gone and drinks refilled! There was a little issue where my drink was ordered twice and forgotten, but considering everything else, and how packed the place was, I can certainly be understanding.

All in all, a great experience and when I have friends and family in town(which is quite frequently) I will use that as an excuse to come back here and try all those things I didn't have room for on this occasion.

5 stars and a double rainbow all the way!"
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"We paid a moving company to move only our larger, two-man items to our new home. We just needed a small box truck to move our boxes, totes, and other miscellaneous items. 

We actually just rolled on in here one morning at 8 am and asked what was available to rent for the day. Luckily, they did have a 10' box truck available! Perfect!

The rate was $19.95 per day plus 69 cents a mile. Not in a mood to price shop I was glad just to have a truck available at the first place I tried! I did opt to take their insurance for $14 per day. Usually, I am not one to just grab the upgrades and extra insurances, but the peace of mind alone was well worth that measly $14 fee.

If you have ever rented a truck before, than you know the drill. They pull it up, do the walk around, and verify the gas level. Honestly, just throw some gas in the tank before you come back. The price they charge you to refill it is not worth it!

After using the truck for about 7 hours, we swept out the back of the truck and brought it back. The gentleman who checked us back in was very friendly. After asking how the truck worked for us and if we had any problems, he was able to verify the charges and print up a receipt for us! The charges totaled around $80. I can totally live with that. He was also really grateful we had swept up the back of the truck. It was almost funny how happy he was about that! What can I say? I aims to please!

I was really satisfied with my experience here and would definitely recommend them to others. I sure as hell ain't moving again anytime in the foreseeable future(damn sight better not !), so I can't say I will be using them myself again anytime soon.

The only thing that really bugged me about this place was the fact that when you pull in off of Las Vegas Blvd. there are a group of guys apparently looking for under-the-table-temp work here. Kind of like Home Depot style. When we turned in about 8-10 guys were literally jumping up and down and waving at us while aggressively approaching the car. A definite W.T.F moment, if there ever was one.  They followed us to our parking spot asking if we needed help. Just said no thank you and they were cool about backing off politely. Still, that should not be something you should have to encounter when you pull in to U-Haul to rent a truck. I asked the guy inside if he was aware of it. He just rolled his eyes and said, ""yes we are and it's really annoying. Metro really doesn't care about it"". Nice.

Anyways, that aside I really had a great experience here!

4 solid stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Wow! I am so impressed with the Rio Hotel and Casino right now. I've lived in Las Vegas going on 7 years now, so I think I can officially say I'm a local. I'm well aware of the reputation that most of the casino properties around town possess. The Rio doesn't have the worst reputation, but it certainly is not as highly held as it was around the turn of the century.

That being said, when my mother paid a recent visit to Las Vegas, she mentioned that she liked the Rio, so I set her up for a night there as a part of her visit. I got a great deal on a third party website and hoped for the best.

Things actually started off on a bit of a sour note. When I called to ask about an early check in around 2pm I was told that there were no early check ins unless a 15.00 fee was paid. No thank you, we will wait the extra 2 hours.When we arrive the main entrance off of Flamingo Road is blocked by a Metro Police officer. Nice. When we finally found our way into the property, only valet seemed to be available, with a massive line to boot. I am thinking this was a huge mistake.

But they really turned things around quick! The valet had us checked in less than 3 minutes later, we unload her luggage and head inside. The line for check in is healthy but not too bad and the front desk agents are really moving thru them rather quickly. We waited for maybe 10 minutes, which wasn't too bad at all. We are called to the desk to check in by Walter. Walter is incredibly friendly and very helpful. I explained the situation that I was a local and had gotten the room for my mother fon her 62nd birthday and all I asked was to request a high floor for her, since she loves a good view(who doesn't, huh? :P) Walter upgraded her from the standard king room to a massive 1600 square foot suite on the 31rst floor! All for no upgrade charge! Wow! Thank You Walter! I can't thank him enough as this was easily one of the highlights of her trip! She is STILL talking about the suite she got to enjoy for the night! The room was very clean with cieling to floor windows with a gorgeous view of the strip! 

We saw the Show in the Sky (which was a lot of fun) and had fun gambling and eating on the property. I stayed in the Rio myself in 2006 and always thought highly of it, so I don't understand some of the things I hear about it. I have always had fun at the Rio. Plus that buffet is pretty good to boot!

Thanks again to Walter for helping to make a special memory for my mother on her 62nd birthday! It means more to her than you realize. 

For their fine guest services, the Rio gets 5 stars from me!"
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"For all the overly critical reviews here, I thoroughly enjoyed the show Panda! I also, like many apparently, received a pair of comp'ed tickets to the show at the Palazzo. 

I'm sure you can read many of the specs in other reviews. The show is dark Wednesday and Thursday. Panda!  runs roughly 80-90 minutes long. They have many photo opportunities along the outside, but certainly not in the theater during the show. (Which, by the way, should be common sense, people. These acrobats do some incredible stunts and balancing acts during the show and don't want some inconsiderate bonehead snapping their flash in their eyes because they ""wanted a cool shot"". For every 99 people who would be considerate enough to not use flash photography, there's always going to be that one who would not. So I understand just keeping them out altogether.)

We went on a Monday night and walked in around 7:15pm for the 7:30 start. The Palazzo Theater is a small, intimate theater. I was a little surprised at how small it was actually. The chairs weren't necessarily the most comfortable, but I've dealt with worse seating(As much as I love the show its self, Absinthe at Caesar's always comes to mind). 

They actually upgraded us to the front row! Wow! Can't beat that! 

As for the show, the stunts by the performers were pretty damn impressive and I found myself nervous for them on many occasions. Our hero, the Panda, is  trying to win back his love, the rediculously flexible Peacock Princess, after she is kidnapped by a ""demon vulture"". He gets help from a Shaolin martial arts master who teaches him the art of kung fu.

Some of the best parts of the show are when the real monks come out and do their thing. Including one little pint sized monk who was just rediculously cute lol Seriously, you have to see this little guy!

They do keep the audience engaged and there were many interactive components to the show. In fact at one point, one of the performers came off the stage, performed a ""magic trick"" and handed my friend a little stuffed Panda. lol It was pretty amusing.

It IS a show that will make the kids happy, but I am in my mid 40's and I liked it a lot as well. I know people are going to think I'm either nuts or trolling, but I can honestly say that this show was better than Ka! Yes, that's right! Panda! is better than Ka! I'm serious. Ka!, the most overrated Cirque in all of history, bored me to tears and I loved this show.

The only thing I didn't care for was the constant pandering for applause. That got to be a bit much after a while. Other than that though, I think it's a great show for people of all ages..so I give it..

4 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"We came here last night as a group of 6 to celebrate a friends birthday. I had heard great things about Maggiano's from friends and co-workers over the years. Since we love Italian food, I was very excited for this meal.

Quite the disappointment. 

We ordered Johnny's Carbonara  ($18.25) and Mom's Lasagna ($16.95). The food was actually quite good! Portion sizes are generous and filling. My carbonara was creamy and rich and the bacon was cooked perfectly! I have zero complaints about the food. We had several appetizers and deserts as well. The flat bread pizza was a perfect light snack to enjoy while waiting for our main dishes. Plus after the meal that chocolate cake was out of this world! Very rich!

I really dig the atmosphere as well! Plenty of touches that scream Italy and Vegas, like pics of the Rat Pack and whatnot. 

why the 2 stars?

Unfortunately, lackluster service was the issue. Nathan was our waiter for the evening. While the service wasn't completely terrible, several things were amiss. Items requested were forgotten, even after he verified the request. Drink orders were separate and staggered, instead of together. 

I guess where all the disappointment stems from is when we went to pay the bill and leave. We went as essentially 3 sets of 2 people. When asking for the bills to be split, just having 2 people put on one separate bill proved to be such an apparently laborious task, we decided to just settle the last 4 among ourselves. For the 2 of us, our bill came to roughly $36 dollars. I rounded up to $40 and added a $10 tip. I was charged a flat $50 and signed my credit card slip. 

Nathan came back and then told me that the $50 did not include his tip. Mind you, he was tipped from all parties at the table. He was taken care of in that regards, and I think quite well all things considered.  He basically just stood there over me without saying a word. I did not want to gripe over $10 at a special friends birthday gathering, so I gave him another $10 cash. It felt like a shakedown and left a very sour taste in my mouth. Everyone at the table agreed that it was out of line and inappropriate. For this alone, we will not be back to Maggiano's. 

I hope that $10 was worth it, because now 6 people have a sour opinion of Maggiano's and we will certainly seek other options for our regular get togethers.

I am still quite annoyed with how the situation played out and this ruined what was otherwise a great meal with great friends. I am not going to give them 1 star simply because the food was very good. 

But we will not be back and I'm pretty sure our friends were just as put off by the whole thing as well.

2 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"I have been a member here since May of 2015. I have always told people this place can be adequate as a ""beginners gym"". 

(+) Great selection and amount of cardio equipment here. Probably the best thing going bout this place. There are plenty of treadmills to be found here, in addition to stationary bikes and ellipticals. 
(+) If you have the black membership ($20 a month), you have access to massage beds, which can be a nice little perk. They do limit you to 10 minutes per day on them, though.

(-) Like most gyms, the place can be a bit ""clique-y"" and front desk people are not very friendly for the most part. A couple of them are nice, but they are the exception to the rule.
(-) This place is known for some of the ridiculous gimmicks they have that do anything BUT promote a healthier lifestyle...like the monthly pizza parties (epic people watching btw. Nothing like seeing two guys well north of 200 lbs each bicker over a last slice of pizza..lol..fucking classic), the monthly bagel offerings, and the buckets of tootsie rolls at the desk 24/7. 

I guess what was the last straw for me, and the reason why I found a new gym and terminated my membership here, is that they have a member here they allow to workout with his parrot. 

Yes. You read that right.

There is a larger man who walks in and walks on the cardio equipment with a parrot on his shoulder. Sometimes the bird ends up perched on the equipment. Am I the only one who sees this as pretty unhygienic? It sure felt that way when I asked the staff about it. First I was told ""don't worry, he doesn't actually work out here"". 

Wait. What?? It is still a gym, no?

Well, this guy is on his phone pouring sweat with the bird on his shoulder, so he was sure as hell working something, somewhere. Was the bird always on his shoulder? No. At times it perches on the equipment. What happens when this thing wants to take a shit? 

Point being, It's a bird and doesn't fucking belong in a gym. Somebody should have told this guy that in no uncertain terms. Instead, I am looked at like I am the one with the problem because I don't want to work out where they let animals in/around/on the equipment. I actually feel sorry for that guy. It's obviously a desperate cry for attention that he feels he can't get without having a bird perched on his shoulder everywhere he goes. 

But whatever. Keep it out of the gym. It doesn't belong there. 

What if I were allergic to birds? I can't even have a reasonable expectation that Planet Fitness will keep these animals out of a gym.

It's a joke and inexcusable. 

1 star.

Seriously, there are several gyms in the immediate area and ALL are better options than Planet Fitness."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"This was freaking fantastic! 

My friend and I were in town visiting with family and just happened to be in the Metro Center area. We decided we felt like hitting a steakhouse and on the perimeter of the mall there were three in a row near I-17. Since this place was recommended by a co-worker of one of my family members, it won out. We checked Yelp! and noticed it had 3 1/2 stars, so my expectations were somewhat tempered, but we went ahead anyway.

What a pleasant surprise! We were immediately acknowledged by the host with a big smile and, even though the place was pretty busy, were immediately led to a booth. 

Now it is loud in there, but we very much enjoyed the atmosphere! It was lively and festive..very upbeat! Our waitress came out and asked if it was our first visit and answered a ton of questions regarding menu items and hooked up our drinks right away. She was very personable and engaging. We were already impressed with the service level at this point and now were anxious to check out the food!

I ordered the 11 oz. sirloin steak with a caesar salad and mashed potatoes(14.99). The steak was so thick and juicy, cooked perfectly to the medium rare I love! 

My friend ordered a large porterhouse T-Bone steak (24.99) which was huge! I was jealous! I'll have to grab that next time!

My other friend grabbed the ""Road Kill"" (14.99) (sounds appetizing, doesn't it? lol), which is a 10 oz. chop steak smothered with sautéed onions, sautéed mushrooms, and jack cheese. He was able to add a side of ribs and a bowl of chili to that as well. 

It was fantastic how they staggered the dishes! First we had the salads and the chili. Shortly after finishing those dishes, out came the main dishes! It was just perfectly timed! Everybody at the table was raving about how great the food tasted!

All the while, the staff would announce when a member of the military was in the restaurant or when someone had a birthday! They would than lead the whole place into a Yee-Haw!! to celebrate! lol We got a kick out of it! It was fun! Than near the end of our meal the staff came out and did a whole sing-dance-line dance routine. We were really enjoying the atmosphere! I've read other reviewers complain about these things, and I say....shut the hell up! Its called TEXAS ROADHOUSE! What did you expect?? Miserable pricks...

On top of all that, as we were getting ready to leave, the manager approached us and acknowledged it was our first visit, thanked us, and presented us with a complimentary bag of peanuts. I know it was just a bag of peanuts, but I was really impressed! It was a class move and it just sealed the 5 star deal for me!

So to re-cap: Great service, great food, fun and festive atmosphere...all at an insanely affordable price! How can you lose??? Get down here and check this place out! You won't regret it!

5 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"*****Update: After reading the reply from the company, I am going to call them tomorrow and speak to Elena again. She had mentioned a while ago that my issue had gone to claims, but did not mention the time frame of 90 days. 

After the matter has been resolved I will certainly update my rating and review accordingly. I really want to be as fair as possible and take these ratings and reviews seriously. I also really want to give Move 4 Less every benefit of the doubt. 

With no mention of the 90 day time period and the recent lack of replies, I think any reasonable person would assume that a satisfying resolution was not forthcoming.

For the time being I will bump it up to 2 stars for the fast reply. After the situation is resolved I will update it yet again.*****







It really is a shame I have to write this review as a 1 star review. Had Move 4 Less just stepped up to the plate and done what was right, this was easily a 4 or 5 star review.

Allow me to explain...

We got the keys for our new home in early November. In an effort to mitigate charges for the pending move, we decided to rent a truck and move all the boxes and smaller items and just pay a moving company for the 2 man items. Move 4 Less had decent reviews and was also recommended by a co-worker. 

They sent 2 guys to help with a truck full of items. The guys were hard working, hustled, and did an excellent job in the 5 hours they moved our items. The only damage to any of our items occurred on literally the very last item on the truck, our sofa. While bringing it through the doorway the wood backboard was scraped along a front ridge, causing visible damage. I paid over $1300 for this sofa. I didn't even freak out. All I asked was that the damage be touched up and repaired. The guys said no problem and made a notation of the damage on our receipt. 

We were still impressed with how hard the guys worked and, I thought, tipped them very generously(Is $70 each a good tip for a mover??). I didn't want to hold one mistake against them after all their hard work that day.

This was at the end of the first week of November. At first they asked for a pic of the damage(which I will post) and it sounded as if it would not become an issue. It has now been more than 6 weeks and there has been no communication, replies to our calls/emails, or any effort at all to make this right. I have held off on writing this review in an effort to give them EVERY reasonable chance to take care of this situation. It is fairly obvious we have been given the brush off.  

Please consider their reply, or lack thereof, when considering using this company. I believe it really reflects their character and how they operate. They damaged the item, acknowledged they caused the damage, and have failed to rectify the matter.

Completely unprofessional. Completely unethical. Utterly disappointing.

1 star."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"What an eggs-ceptional experience!! 

See what I did there?? Huh?? See that??

Everybody who knows me know I love breakfast foods and love eggs especially!  A coworker of mine kept telling me that I had to check this place out. ""You can't go wrong here, Mike."" "" You'll love it, Mike."" "" This has you name written all over it, Mike.""

Damn, they were so right!

Egg Works is located right next to a McDonald's on the east side of Rainbow just south of the 215 freeway. As we pull into the parking lot this morning, first thing we take note of is that it is crowded as hell! There were no spaces actually at Egg Works, so we actually had to park behind McDonald's. Good news is that speaks volumes as to their reputation. On the flip side, how long is it going to take to get seated and how long until we actually get to devour some grub! We parked and figured we'd give it a shot.

We literally did not have to wait at all! A couple entered right before us and no sooner did they enter the door, a hostess was escorting them to a table. Just as soon as they took off before us another hostess appeared and walked us to our table. Wow! That was seamless! 

Sitting at our table, we noticed the healthy portions of food at the other diners tables. This was starting to look promising! Our waitress appeared and took our drink order. We had our drinks within maybe 3 minutes of walking through the door! 

After giving us a few minutes to make a selection, our waitress took our order and was off again. We noticed this place had a ton of people taking to-go orders with them. This place is wildly popular and I can't believe I'm just discovering this now!

When our waitress returned with our food, she actually apologized for the wait! We just looked at each other and laughed since it was literally less than 10 minutes from the time we ordered. 

Wasn't exactly what to try first, but I love me a good cheese omelette, so I figured that was a safe bet. The cheese was so much tastier here than at some other breakfast places I frequent. The dish came with 4 slices of buttered toast and seasoned hash brown nuggets. Very tasty! My friend opted for the Denver omelette and raved about his, as well.

On our next visit(which is a foregone conclusion), we agreed to try one of those skillets. Those things looked powerful good!

I'm also digging the little system they have set up with the happy egg/sad egg. If you are pleased with everything and want to be left to enjoy your food, just keep the happy egg up. If you need something or need to speak to somebody, just flip it to the sad egg. We only used this once to get a drink refil, and it only took about 15 seconds for someone to take care of the issue. This was impressive considering how packed the place was at the time!

This place is freaking awesome and we will be back. A lot. And often. And again. And you get the point.

Spoiler Alert: Mike F. will be checking in to this place a lot!

5 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Recently used Hertz for my 1 day, turnaround trip to Los Angeles. I really should have gone with my usual preferred rental car company of Enterprise. I won't make that mistake twice.

Anyways, back to Hertz. Made the reservation online a couple of days in advance for a RAV4 at a good price. I had 5 total people going, so I needed a little extra room. I paid in advance for a cheaper rate, as opposed to paying at the counter.

When I get to the counter, I am ""greeted"" by an older hispanic male, whose name was hidden by his jacket. He took my ID and the same card I used online. I used a debit card online. He tells me they will have to pull my credit unless I give him my credit card to use as well and that we will have to refund the amount on the debit card and then put everything on the credit card. I do not want to go thru all that mess, so against my better judgement, I agreed to the credit pull. Ends up it is a hard pull and now shows up(and dings) my credit report. Thank You Hertz.

After all that is complete, he says we have no more RAV4's. He tries to upsell me to a Mercedes. I laugh. Overkill. I do not need a Mercedes. He insists that it is a fine vehicle. I tell him I'm sure it is, but not what I need for the situation. He asks a third time. Dude, I do NOT need a frickin' Mercedes. Thank You. I tell him I'd rather have the cheapest thing he has got and finally get something more along the lines of what I was looking for, a KIA Sorento. Sheesh, finally.

Now the insurance. A long time ago, the first time I ever rented a car from ""God Knows who"", I got suckered into this racket. Ever since then I always call my insurance company to verify how I am covered. My personal insurance covers me as long as it is in the SW states of Nevada, California, and/or Arizona with rental cars. Therefore, my personal insurance covers me. So when he asks, I say ""no thanks"".  He then tries to feed me some line saying your insurance won't cover it, you will pay 100% everything. I say, no it covers it(minus my $500 deductible, of course). He insists, ""No you will be sorry if something happens.You will pay all of it!"".  I'm not arguing with this clown, so I said ""whatever, no insurance. I got this."" Some of us know exactly how we are covered and I don't appreciate the approach this guy took to try to ""scare"" me into taking the unnecessary additional insurance.

I grab the car and go about my merry way. I was already wildly unimpressed by this point and wondering why I didn't spend the few extra bucks and stick with Enterprise.

Returned the vehicle about 20 hours later and return was relatively quick, but the lady was very short and borderline grouchy. Maybe she was having a bad day. Maybe the first guy was having a bad day. Whatever. Everything else actually went off without a hitch, which is the only  reason I am not 1 starring Hertz. 

I am so sorry Enterprise. I'm coming back, baby! :P

2 stars.

I have sure as hell experienced better!"
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"I recently spent two days at the Riviera while I was having some work done at the house. Since I work graves, I just wanted a place that was cheap and where I could get some sleep for the nights shift.

I was able to get a room at the Riv for only $24 a night plus a $15 per night resort fee. So for under $40 a night, I figured it might be a good spot for this purpose. 

Okay, first off (spoiler alert ) I am giving it 4 stars. Not necessarily because it is a 4 star property (once again, spoiler alert..it is not), but because of the value you get from the price you pay. For $40 a night, with a clean and renovated room on the strip, you definitely get your moneys worth here! And although it is not the best place on the strip, it also isn't the worst (Quad/IP, Circus Circus, and Hooters can compete for that ""honor"").

A few random notes from my experience here-

-when I booked the reservation, I was told I could check in early at 10am for an additional $10 fee. Not bad I'm thinking...but when I got to the desk to check in I was told it was more like $20 and change. Huh? Luckily, the manager waived the fee and made me happy in the process...but I'm still not 100% sure what the actual fee is..

-I would definitely pay the upgrade fee to stay in the Monacco Tower. I was told it's roughly $20 per day. Those are the most recently renovated room and are actually quite nice and good size for a $40 room. Plus you get a view of the pool...for what that is worth to you..The lady who checked me in was very friendly and engaging. I couldn't see her name badge since her long hair was covering it. I asked about the Monacco Tower rooms and upgrade fee...oh and around this time I tipped her $10 for getting the early check in fee waived for me and , what do ya know?, she was able to upgrade me to a room in that tower for free as well..Awesome!..After explaining why I was there, she got me a very quiet room at the end of the hallway and it worked out great! 

- I decided to play tourist a little bit and do a bit of gambling, not much luck there...Didn't even seem to get much play either. No bueno..oh well..guess I'd better keep that job

-They do have cheap drink specials at the main casino bar...$1 drafts...choice of Miller Lite or PBR

-They have an ABC store on site as well offering ""bend you over, Mr. Tourist"" pricing

-Seems when you sign up at the cage for a players card, you do recieve a free Riviera T-shirt'

- Most employees I encountered were very friendly...although it kind of struck me as odd at how ""robotic"" the lady was who checked me out...but I don't believe she was intentionally rude...

-This place does have some old school charm to it with the brass, chandeliers, and classic signage strewn about the property..I actually liked that..

-location is not the greatest...really only Circus Circus and Wynn/Encore are in reasonable walking distance...

I was very satisfied with my brief stay here, and if the need arises again, I may stay here again in the future..for the right price.

4 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"Taking the space that was previously occupied by Simon, You will find Cafe 6 on the 6th floor at Palms Place. I never had the pleasure of dining at Simon, so this was my first time in the room. The space is light and casual with a fantastic view of the pool! This makes for a more quiet, comfortable and intimate setting.

We were quickly greeted by our wonderful hostess and seated at a table with a fantastic view of poolside! Our server, Carmen, quickly approached us with suggestions and recommendations on things we should try. Carmen was fantastic! Extremely sweet, personable, and engaging, she helped to make our experience at Cafe 6 an outstanding one!

We first ordered some drinks and a couple of appetizers. We opted for an order of Chicken Wings ($10.95) with some ""Burn Your Face Off""(lol) and Buffalo sauce. We also decided to try some Buttermilk Chicken Tenders ($10.95), also with an assortment of dipping sauces on the side. The wings were outstanding! They were plump and juicy, with plenty of meat on the bones! Just awesome! Some of the best wings I've had in a while! The chicken tenders were also great. Again, very tender and juicy with the skin just slipping off the meat as you bit into it! So, so tasty!

The manager, Michelle, approached our table to both introduce herself and see how we were enjoying ourselves. I absolutely love when managers take a genuine interest in their guests and how their experience is going. This was a nice touch and greatly appreciated.

We next enjoyed one of the Baked 14 oz Soft pretzels($9.95)! This thing was MASSIVE! Honestly, this was one of my favorite menu items here and second only to my burger! It was so soft and tasty! We plowed through that thing in no time! We will DEFINITELY be back for more of that soon!

Last, but certainly not least, we each enjoyed a tasty burger! How can we not?? I opted for the Dr. Pepper Mushroom Burger cooked medium rare ($15.95)(w/ a side of waffle fries), while my friend chose to enjoy the Smoke Out Burger ($17.95)(w/ a side of onion rings). 

WOW!

I LOVED my burger! The angus beef was cooked to perfection and full of so much flavor, my burger was incredible! My favorite menu item of the day! The Dr Pepper glaze was not overwhelming, as I had feared it might. In fact, it seemed to bring out all the flavor of the burger with the mushrooms and caramelized onions! Superb! My friend raved about his burger and had mentioned that it was the best burger he had eaten in this town in a long time! Safe to say we were both VERY satisfied. 

We were both pretty stuffed by this point, but had to try at least one desert! So, on Michelle's recommendation, we tried the Fried Cookie Cutter ($9.95). A combonation of vanilla bean ice cream, chocolate ganache, and....wait for it....

Deep Fried Oreos!

lol So incredibly delicious! 

Cafe 6 offers up scrumptious food at great prices, with outstanding service to boot! Suffice it to say that I am a fan and will be back for countless visits. There is still so much on the menu I have to try out!

Woohoo! As good as it gets!

5 stars!"
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"I really think this place is getting a bad rap. I had the pleasure of staying here this past Thursday night and, except for a few minor glitches, really enjoyed my stay here. I actually stayed at the Sahara back in 2009, which was just a couple of years before it was shut down. I can tell you that the difference between what it looked like when it closed to what it looks like now is nothing short of astounding! 

Just a few thoughts and observations from my experience here..

- Check in was pretty quick and smooth. Only problem was that the agent who checked me in couldn't have been more disinterested. Maybe he was having a bad day? Who knows? 

-Check out was masterful! The agent (I believe his name was Cesar)was friendly and efficient and seemed to take a genuine interest in finding out how my stay went. This was a great final impression of the SLS.

- The room i was assigned to was located on the 7th floor(meh) and had a decent view of the Stratosphere.

-I enjoyed the actual set up of the room! I found the beds to be very comfortable with plenty of pillows. The shower head was fantastic! Great water flow! I loved it so much I showered the first night and first thing in the morning! They have large mirrors on both sides of the room framed with lighting. This created a pretty cool effect when they were both lit up! Also, I do have to mention that the room does come equipped with a huge 55"" TV's! Very nice! The square footage of the room ittself is pretty small, but it's not THAT small.

- It doesn't hurt that we won here either! lol Just played a little bit. I was literally down to my last $3 I planned on gambling and was playing penny slots. Actually, I was only playing 35 cents a spin (which was the minimum) when I hit a progressive for $900! Woo-hoo! But that was just icing on the cake! The SLS would have still gotten the same rating from me regardless.

-the young lady working in the gift shop around midnight was very friendly and helpful! Also I should mention that the employees at the cage and players club are always very pleasant.

...and a few hiccups..

- what is it with the freaking elevator in the parking garage? They have got to get that thing fixed and running efficiently

- why in the blue hell would you have the Griddle Cafe closed from 4-11 pm? This makes zero sense to me and I was disappointed because I have really been wanting to check out this place. Oh well, some other day, I suppose.

- there was a lipstick mark on one of our glasses. 

- there was one long hair strand in the bathroom (and I am bald as an eagle), but otherwise the place was spotless! 

-everybody complains about the location on the far north end of the Strip, but I think it's admirable that they took the bold and gutsy move of finally spending some money to try to improve the north end! 

I really believe that the SLS is a quality place that just needs time to ""work out the kinks"". I enjoyed it here and have been several times to enjoy the Umami Burger! I truly hope that, eventually, they are able to excel and thrive on the Strip for many years to come!

4 stars."
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"The Melting Pot made my first fondue dining experience a memorable one! I had never even thought to try a place like this until a couple of great friends suggested it for a get together. 

We set up our reservation a few days in advance and I have to admit I was pretty curious as to what all this would entail by the time we got there. 

Our waiter, Tyler, was fantastic! He was knowledgeable, personable, and hilarious! He put a great emphasis on presentation and truly added to the experience of it all. 

We opted for the 4 course meal for our entire party.

It all got started with the cheese fondue. Tyler prepared the cheese  and brought out items to dip into the cheese. Among the items were bread pieces, apple slices, baby carrots, cauliflower, among other things. My favorites were the bread and apple slices. The bread was a little hard and I'm sure that was intentional, but I would have loved to had totally soft bread to sop up more of that tasty cheese! The cheese was thick, gooey, and so incredibly tasty! The whole table was all over it!

Next was the salad. While everyone else at the table opted for house salads, I went for the caesar salad! The salad was light and delicious! A great way to cleanse the palate for what was coming next!

...which was the main course! I opted for the Steak Lovers ($39.95)which consists of a premium filet mignon, teriyaki-marinated sirloin and
certified angus beef sirloin. Apparently, you can add a lobster tail for an additional $9.95, but I thought I'd save that for next time. All three meats were savory and delectable! Absolutely loved it! They bring you an assortment of 6 different sauces to dip your meats into. One spicy, one mustard, another sour cream, and some kind of other sauce that incredible! I think Tyler called it ""Green Goddess""? lol I hope I got that right. The entire party loved hat and we had to get some more, as it ran out pretty fast!

Finally, it all wraps up with desert! We all decided to have The Original, which is a milk chocolate fondue swirled with peanut butter! How can you go wrong with that! They bring you another plate of snacks to dip into your chocolate fondue, Items such as strawberries, rice krispies squares, pineapple slices, and pound cake squares. The choclate was thick and creamy and oh so delicious! A great way to cap off the meal!

I remember thinking at the begining of the meal, that it didn't look like all that much food, but by the end I was stuffed! It was all very filling and satisfying!

The only reason I chose 4.5 stars instead of 5 was...
- a couple times during the meal, there were some inordinate delays in getting items and refilling some others. It wasn't a big deal, but it did hamper the flow of the meal.

Other tidbits-
-they allow you to bring your own wine, but be aware there is a $15.00 corkage fee
-one of the members of our party was celebrating her birthday and they were kind enough to bring her out a chocolate covered strawberry plate with Happy Birthday signed in chocolate on the plate. Was a very nice and appreciated touch!

As I said at the outset, The Melting Pot made my first fondue experience a very memorable one! I would not hesitate to recommend this place and we will certainly be back to show other friends about this place as our friends introduced us to it! 

4.5 stars!"
CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,"I was going back and forth on 3 or 4 stars on this one. So, I will give them 4 based on..

a)wanting to give them the benefit of the doubt
b) I've been there the past couple of weeks and plan on going back again this weekend

Central Christian is located just south of Russel Road off of New Beginnings Way (see what they did there ??), which is found between Stephanie and the Boulder Highway.

Things I like-
- they always have a positive message and a welcoming attitude..they're big on the ""It's okay to not be okay"" thing. I like that. 
- People are very friendly here, more so than most other churches I've been to recently. I'm not only talking about staff, but fellow parishioners as well.
- They have a bookstore and coffee shop on property. I'm not a coffee drinker, but that shop seems really popular, before and after service. I did find a few titles in the bookstore that I would like to check out though.
-plenty of parking, with church employees helping to navigate everyone through the lots
- lively, positive, and energetic service! I do like the music in the beginning. I grew up going to a Catholic school as a child and after many years (eons, really) away from church, I never imagined I would like this ""style"" of worship. But I'm coming around..
Plus after attending some catholic services, I've come to the stark realization that it no longer fits what I am looking for..but, I digress..


Things I didn't really care for-
-A #1...they really push for the donations/tithing/giving to such a degree that it is getting to be very off-putting. I understand the Lord loves a generous giver. I know it is better to give than receive. I consider myself very, very blessed and very much enjoy giving...and will always give. But they harp on it so much here! Ease off the gas pedal just a bit, please. 

They always mention it in the beginning of the service(no problem there), than again they go over other options, such as paying on the website, in the lobby after the service, and of course during the service. This past Sunday it was even incorporated as part of the sermon. Chill, guys. People will give. Relax.
-I didn't like the fact that they single out new attendees. I understand some might like and appreciate this. I am not one of those people. They have new guests park in a designated area in the back. Ok, no problem...I'm the new guy...I'll do that. Then, during the service they ask you to fill out a card and bring it to an area near the coffee shop after the service to meet with someone to ""discuss your journey"" and collect a free gift. I don't need to be bribed to come to your church. Is this where funds are going to?? I just like to walk in, sit down, and see how I feel about the church in general..

The funny thing is..I like it. I like it enough to have gone the past few weeks and to keep on attending.

-They had the Las Vegas Tenors make a guest appearance last week and they started the service by performing ""Long Train Runnin'"". I like the Doobie Brothers and I like the song...and it sounded great. I just though, ""wrong place, wrong time"". Just seemed odd and a bit inappropriate for the setting. Maybe it's just me..

I do wish there was more of an emphasis on the sermon and scripture than the music and all, but that's just my preference.

But after checking out several churches in the Vegas valley, this is the one I am most comfortable with thus far..so I will be back..

4 stars."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Suede has been around for awhile now. It's no spring chicken. But I still find the place to be a good time, if you can stand the wall-to-wall people and the loooong lines for the bathroom (only the ladies bathroom, of course).  I think the drink prices are normal for a Scottsdale bar and they aren't any higher or lower than what you'll find at Myst, Axis/Radius or Six...strange, don't they all have the same owner??  It's a fun spot to go though and even if you're not feeling it, you can walk right over to Axis or Pussycat and not take much time out of your night to do it since they're right across the street. If it's a good night, Suede plays the best hip hop and rap music to dance to and the floor will be packed.  On a bad night, the DJ is spinning techno crap (I'm not a fan) and my friends and I will go somewhere else for the night.  There is never a cover for girls, although I think there is always one for guys on Friday and Saturday nights.  Guys have to dress up a little too...I think Suede follows the no hat rule and the bouncer may take a look at your shoes too- guys can't wear sandals or sneakers (I think!) So definitely call and get their updated dress code before you head out."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"If you're hungry for tradition, I wouldn't go here. 
While this location was the first one in Phoenix, I think the food has gone downhill. I'd rather go to Carlos any day than have dinner at Macayo's. 
The food is just okay. The chips are just okay. The salsa is just okay.
Nothing stands out as being really good, except maybe the margaritas.
If you purchase a Senor Bob or Cha Cha mug, you can get discount margaritas with every visit. But that means you actually have to tote a Mexican man or woman shaped mug back with you each time you eat a meal here.
My mom actually has both Senor Bob and Cha Cha.... 
*sigh*
I prefer to just to buy a margarita any time I'm here and they're pretty good. I like the frozen strawberry and the classic rocks/salt marg. 
If you're looking for a fun after work happy hour spot, the bar area of Macayo's is freaking hoppin.'  It's so busy that it can be a little tough to even find a parking spot.  I think they have a little buffet and drink specials during happy hour. And as it gets later on Friday evenings, the place almost turns into a little club. People start dancing and the music blares.
If you decide to go, just look for the Mayan temple look alike on Central."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"I give Arizona Center three stars because I used to work at a restaurant in it (cough, cough, Hooters) but if it wasn't for the memories, I would probably whack off a star, or maybe even two. 

It's disappointing because Arizona Center has so much potential.  If some new, good stores would move in, we would have another nice, outdoor shopping center that would attract more than bums and hookers. 

But alas, we don't, so we're stuck with the bums that grab french fries off your plate if you eat outside at Hooters and ladies of the night that swipe tips left on tables. 

Okay, maybe it's not always thaaat bad...Arizona Center does draw out of towners looking to purchase cactus magnets or kokopelli sweatshirts before heading to the airport since there is a plethora of souvenir shops there.  And they also have an Uno's Pizzeria I believe and a movie theater. But it also gets pretty busy before Suns games (not anymore, sigh) or other sporting events going on in the area. 

One bright spot is the rental of their grotto for a special outdoor event.  The landscaping is beautiful, with trees, streams and flowers everywhere.  And it's pretty reasonable considering the outrageous fees for renting nice venues in AZ."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Hooray! There is a new bar open by me!! Finally! Woo Hoo!
To understand my excitement, you must first also understand that I live really far out. My apartments are on the way to Fountain Hills.  And it's not unusual to find a coyote running through my parking lot. Seriously. And the first time it happened, I thought it was a dog that needed help. And I was walking over to it saying ""do you need help little buddy?"" and luckily a friendly neighbor intervened by asking if I realized it was a coyote. Whew. Not my brightest moment. And before you judge me, please realize, they do look like dogs. Really.

Back to The Office...It's a pretty cool bar and a good place to watch 'the game,' whichever one that might be.  It's small-ish but they serve up good sandwiches, burgers, apps etc. and of course, they have all the regulars when it comes to beer and cocktails.  And while I am jazzed about this place, it still can't touch Tango. Tango Grill bartenders pour the strongest freaking drinks. And they're only $4 all the time- or $4.25 if you get juice with your cocktail. And $3 during happy hour. Come on, you really can't beat that. But if you live in the area and you need a little change of pace from Tango, check out The Office- it's pretty fun."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"I have mixed feelings about Salt River.  On one hand, there's the filthy, pee infused water, but on the other hand, there's a fun, relaxing day spent floating down the river.  Hmm.

Like most natives, I've been here more times than I care to admit.  And it only took me two or three times to realize that when mom says to put on sunblock, she's not kidding.

A few blistered body parts later, I now coat myself from head to toe in SPF 45 anytime I get remotely close to Salt River and you should too. If you plan to spend the day out there, you must bring your sunblock with you and don't think it will be hard to do that. People have coolers and all kinds of other things floating in tubes out there with them, so you'll be able to stash it somewhere. 

And while this is definitely a fun place to bring your kids, you'll also want to keep in mind that this is apparently also a spot that drunks like to frequent.  High school and college kids flock to this place and as a result, I've seen two naked guys floating in a tube as I went past them. On two different occasions. 

Be prepared to see anything, bring lots of sunblock and water and you'll have a great time. Just be sure to take a hot shower when you get home to boil all the germs off your skin."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"How do I love thee Savers? 
Let me count the ways...
I love this Savers. It's so great, I can hardly put it into words. 
Some of the best Halloween costumes I've ever had have been purchased here and some of the most random items you'll ever see can be found amongst the racks. 
The greatest 70's jumpsuit in the history of man was found here.  It's the real deal, complete with rainbow colored stripes going up the leg and across the chest.  It even has a little matching jacket that goes with it.  I wore this for my 70's dance in high school and a few times around the house for no reason at all. I like to think about the person who actually wore this in the 70's. I can picture her dancing the night away at some disco in the jumpsuit and platform shoes. 
But the strangest thing I've found here has to be my balloon crew jumpsuit. I still don't know why I bought it- I'll never wear it, but I laughed so hard when I first saw it that I had tears coming out of my eyes. It's yellow and has the words 'balloon crew' embroidered on the front and two huge hot air balloons embroidered on the back. It's so weird. But it was clearly once a real jumpsuit from some hot air balloon crew. Who knew they even existed. 
I do now, thanks to Savers. 
Go see what you can find!"
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Castles-n-Coasters or Golf-n-Stuff as it used to be called, holds a special place in my heart.  And while it's a little ghetto, it's still a fun place to go if you don't mind the throngs of middle and high school kids.

I went here so many times in my youth that it's impossible to count.  This was always the spot for our class field trips, from grades 4-8.  I do remember one trip, where my 8th grade class walked from our middle school to Golf 'n' Stuff.  Keep in mind that I went to a middle school where it was common for the guys to wear ""gang"" colors and bandanas and I suppose we weren't exactly who you would hope to see walking down the sidewalk as you were waiting in your car at a stoplight.  And as a result, I could hear people locking their car doors one after another as we went down the sidewalk. It was pretty funny. I guess I went to school with some rough-looking kids. Myself not included of course.

But you have the option of playing golf, going inside to play games in the huge arcade, riding go-karts or bumper boats or riding the roller coasters.  It's definitely a fun place, but like I said, it does get packed with those thuggish ruggish looking kids and now that I think about it, I'd probably lock my door if I saw them walking down the street in a huge group too."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Castle Boutique isn't for the meek. And yes I made it rhyme on purpose. 

It has what I assume to be, a selection of pretty much every adult related item possible.  

As well as gag gifts, slutty costumes, lingerie, dirty cards and well, I'm sure you've been (don't lie) so I don't need to go on about its inventory.

But it's just not the classiest joint if you know what I mean. You're sure to see some really sketchy people shopping or shoplifting while you're there and of course there's going to be that creep you're sure is doing something in the corner you don't want to know about.

My friend has this silly Valentine's Day party every year where she gives out prizes such as vibrators, lube, handcuffs and the like as gag gifts and I've gone with her to get these items a few times .

I saw things at Castle Boutique that are still burned into my memory. Giant scary things.  Pervy men. Creepy women. Some regular couples and an old, old man who just shouldn't have been there. I mean, he's gotta be somebody's grandpa. And I just like to live in my bubble world where grandpas buy Werther's Originals, not anal ease.

Here's my advice: if you want to shop for sexy costumes, lingerie or toys of the adult variety, for your own good, shop online.  You don't want to see the things I did."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Oh boy.  I was terrified of this place.  Curry peanut butter?? Sun dried tomato peanut butter?? Sick!  But once I went, I shockingly realized that somehow, it wasn't thaaat bad.

While this is without a doubt, a place that little kids will LOVE to come to and one that adults will grudgingly take them to, if you have to eat here and you're over 12, I recommend getting the veggie sandwich.  It was the least scary lunch option on the menu that wasn't going to taste like a dessert.  It had sun dried tomato peanut butter, lettuce, cucumbers and cheese.  And it wasn't half bad.  But it wasn't half good either.  Let's just say I was surprised that it wasn't disgusting, but I wouldn't go back again unless I had to take another little kid I was babysitting. 

The child in question, a little girl by the name of Natalie, is my friend's daughter and she talked me into going here.  She couldn't say more about the place- she loves it!  And for lunch, she had some white chocolate peanut butter, banana, nutella and caramel concoction that made me sick just looking at it.

But if you want to bring your little one somewhere different and fun that they will love you for, come here.  This would be a cute spot to have a little birthday lunch for your kids with a couple pals that wouldn't cost much at all."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"I have mixed feelings about Fate.  The food is pretty tasty, and the restaurant is a hip house located in a downtown neighborhood.  But on the hand, the food is pricey and portions are small.  If you're going for the atmosphere, then this is a great place for you.  But if you're on a budget and just want good Asian food, you might want to consider somewhere else.

That being said, I did enjoy my visit to Fate, although it took us quite awhile to find it.  Since it's located in a neighborhood, it can be hard to figure out which homes are actually homes and which is the restaurant!  Once inside, the atmosphere is pretty cool.  The walls have art from local artists on them and funky music is playing.

We had to wait about 40 minutes for a table, which seems like quite a while when you're in a tiny little place like Fate.  When we did get seated, our server was attentive, so no complaints there.  The food is good- we got the veggie spring rolls, pad thai noodles, broccoli island and the chow fun.  We had crispy tofu in all of our dishes, although you can opt for chicken, beef or shrimp too.  They also have an extensive wine list if you feel like getting your drink on. We passed on the wine, and had their herbal tea instead. Oh and if you're a night owl, they're open until 3am on the weekends!"
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"I've been to MVCC a few times and it's a pretty nice place.  They have a good golf course and the staff is usually friendly and very helpful.  However, I was just planning my high school reunion and was trying to find a venue to have it at.  I thought of Moon Valley Country Club because we actually had our senior year high school prom there and I thought it might be fun to have our ten-year reunion there also. 

I contacted Sara in catering and she took awhile to respond initially.  Then, when we finally did get her on the phone, the place sounded great. It was reasonable cost-wise and the food sounded good too.  We told Sara to draw up the final costs and send us a document containing them so we could go over it and sign a contract.  At this point, we were 99.9% sure we were going to choose them.  

But the weird thing was that we never heard from Sara again.  She didn't respond to two emails or a phone call and at that point, we didn't feel like we should be hunting down the catering director to give her business. Isn't it the other way around?  

After that, we decided to go to the Hyatt Regency Phoenix and have had much better luck there.  The staff is soo attentive and responds almost immediately to emails. They also worked with us on pricing and budget, so I recommend them instead of Moon Valley."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"I am a Souper Salad fan.

If I'm going to go, I try to make it right when they open, that way I'll be one of the first to get my food.  I have a grubby hands complex about buffets and I figure, if I get there first, I won't have to worry about that, right?

First of all, their salad bar is fantastico.  We're talkin' great.  It's filled with everything you could possibly want on your salad and more, including a plethora of dressing choices.  They also have pasta salads, fruit salads, pudding, fruit and other little delights in this area of SS.

Next up are the hot items.  They have a different menu every day of the week, but some food items always stay the same, like their breadsticks and pizza.  But sometimes they'll add different pastas or some kind of taco bar.  They always have a couple soups too.

If you want dessert, they have a frozen ice cream machine with a few different candy toppings for you to put on top.  They also have all the fixin's to make a pretty damn good strawberry shortcake.

You do get a waiter- he or she will take your drink order and pick up any dirty plates, so you'll need to leave a little tip at the end of your meal.  I can't remember the price per person, but it's pretty cheap, but if you're the coupon-y sort, you can often find one in the Sunday paper to get a dollar or two off."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Bazaar Noir? You're damn skippy it's bizarre.  This little store is impossible to miss when you drive down 7th Avenue.  There's usually a hearse outside with a skeleton chauffeur and the store itself is painted black and white.  Antique wheelchairs are strategically placed by the store's entrance and the place just gives off a creepy vibe.  But creepy can be good, right?  I've been to this shop two times, but it still hasn't been enough to see everything that's jam-packed into it.  It's very cluttered and filled with bones (hopefully not real), clothes, jewelry, art, trinkets, taxidermy animals (yick), books on the occult and much, much more. Probably the strangest part is the little dog that is kept in a giant birdcage. Yes, that's right, down the steps you can see him peering at you from his birdcage, but according to the owner, he's happy that way. He's little and the birdcage allows him to see everything that's going on. Animal cruelty? No. Creepy? Yes. This store has very strange hours as well. It doesn't open early and is only open on certain days. I guess that adds to the mystery of this place.  But what's even stranger is that I heard part of the Bazaar Noir burned down a few months ago, but it's reopening soon. I recommend checking this place out when it's back in business if you're curious or just have an affinity for the darker things in life."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"I don't have many good things to say about Classic Beauty College.  I made the mistake of going awhile back (in fact, I've gone a few times) and I'm never happy with the results.  Thank Jeezy I've only got a trim the times I've been because I feel the results would have been disastrous.

The cut I got was bad enough.  The only reason I've gone here in the first place is because I wanted a cheap and fast haircut, but still didn't want to go to Great Clips.

So I went to Classic Beauty College (and yes I do know that all the students are still learning) but I still thought they'd be able to produce a decent cut.  The last time I went, my hair was trimmed completely uneven on the sides.  It was visibly uneven, yet the girl still called her supervisor over to sign off on it.  Thank god he saw the fear in my eyes and fixed it for me, but that ended up making my hair MUCH shorter than I had wanted it to be originally. 

I also got a manicure here awhile back and honestly, it didn't look any better than I could do at home with some Sally Hansen polish.

Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to go to a nice salon. Or if you're still looking to save a buck or two, go to the Carsten Institute in Tempe- they seem to do a better job with haircuts.

The second star is for the students- even though they clearly can't cut hair, they're still very friendly and talkative."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"My mom loves old, historic homes, so I took her here for our Mother's Day lunch and it was a great choice. Teeter House was built in 1899 and is still decorated in Victorian style.  The floor is creaky in that historic, slightly creepy way and there are a few different rooms you can dine in. 
The menu is light, with salad, soup and sandwiches on the menu, but it's suprisingly good. We had a slight mishap with the menu though...I had called to make reservations on Friday and they asked if we wanted the 'Mother's Day Tea Special,' I said no, that we wanted the regular lunch and was told that was okay.  But when we arrived, we were told they were only serving the Mother's Day Special...despite this, they still accomodated us with the regular menu.
Service was incredibly sloooow because there were only a few people working since it was a 'reservation only ' day. I look forward to going back on a regular day for better service.
On a side note** Teeter House is supposed to be haunted by Mrs. Teeter herself and I swear I heard the toilet flushing and I never saw anyone come out of the bathroom**
If you ask, the staff will show you some pictures that were taken inside the home in which you can see the creepiest, old lady ghost face peering back at you. It freaked me out, but my mom liked it. 
Oh and Rosson House is located next door, it's a historic home you can take a tour of- check it out!"
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"It breaks my heart every time I visit the Arizona Humane Society.  It's such a great place, but it makes me so sad to see all those sweet little faces pressed up against their cages.  

If I could, I would take every single one of those dogs and cats home with me, but I can't, so instead I stop in every now and then to visit with them and hopefully brighten up their day a little bit.

If you are thinking about getting a new pet, this is a great option.  They require all of their pets to be spayed or neutered and they will be given all of their proper shots before you get to take them home.  

Last time I went, I almost left with an eleven year old cat.  He just broke my heart into a million pieces.  It said on his cage that his owner died...OH it still makes me sad. I wanted to get him so badly, but I couldn't afford the outlandish pet fees at my apartment complex and I didn't want to risk smuggling him in. 

But if you can get a pet, definitely check the Humane Society out, or at least come visit the homeless animals once in awhile and maybe stop in their thrift store too to contribute to a worthy cause.  

AND if you're an animal lover, also check out the HALO thrift store on 7th Ave.  They take animals off of death row from the county and put them in foster homes until they can find a permanent one. They run completely off of donations and volunteers, so they could use the help!

sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"I lived by Spectrum Mall (it will always be Christown to me) for years and years and it has always had the potential to be great.  

But for some reason, this mall has never been able to live up to its potential.  Maybe it's the throngs of wannabe thugs that hang out here or the cheap, crappy clothing stores that make it one of the worst places to shop. The last time I went, one of the clothing stores had one big dressing room for everyone to change in together.  What the hell? 

I know they've tried to class it up by bringing in different stores, and they have to an extent.  But it still attracts the thugs and my god, whatever you do, don't go to the Walmart.  It's the dirtiest, smelliest, most god forsaken place in the mall.  Stay far away. And if you happen to park right outside of it, be prepared to be accosted by a lady selling tamales and another lady selling creepy dolls. And while I can appreciate their entrepreneurial spirit, they're also more than a little pushy and aggressive. And it's also a little disconcerting to have someone follow you to your car wielding a pan of tamales. But trust me, if you park here, it will happen. 

The food court is truly lacking and personally, if I were you, I'd take a nice leisurely drive up Lincoln, turn right on Scottsdale Road and spend the day at Scottsdale Fashion Square- where the fitting rooms aren't communal and you won't be asked to buy a creepy doll."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"This lovely bar is in the same shopping plaza as the mini golf place I just reviewed.  My boyfriend and I decided to check it out after playing a rousing jungle-themed 18 holes.

Our perfectly timed arrival meant we were there for happy hour! Yes!  He got a small pitcher of beer for only $3.50 and I got a vodka/soda for $2.25.  

This bar is a classic 'Cheers' neighborhood type spot where everybody knows your name.  Well, not my name, but you get the picture.

They have two pool tables, a shuffleboard thing and darts in their second room.  It costs 75 cents to play a game of pool, so we did.  And I realized that I am quite possibly the worst pool player in the world.  But I didn't feel so bad because I was still flying high from my immense victory over my boyfriend at mini-golf.  Who knew he would be so bad??

We moved back into the main room when their bar games caught our eye.  I love those things.  You know the ones where you play the erotic picture match up game?  And that flying monkey game?  Please someone else tell me that you've experienced the joy of the touch-screen game. 

My boyfriend put in a ten or something and all of a sudden we had 40 credits.  We sat there forever, just drinking our cheap drinks and playing stupid games that are surprisingly fun.   I moved on to red bull/vodkas but was told those aren't on happy hour pricing.  Guess how much they are every day?  $4!!  That doesn't happen anywhere!

I will be back!"
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"You wouldn't know it from the outside, but Pinata Nueva is a hidden Mexican food gem located in North Scottsdale.  If you've driven through the shopping complex there, you've probably seen it, but passed on by. My recommendation is to stop next time for a nice lunch or dinner in their wonderfully air conditioned restaurant. 

The restaurant is small, but it is vibrantly decorated, with yellow, red and blue colored paint on various walls and countless piata's hanging from the ceiling.  I'm talking Santa, the Easter bunny, a ghost, stars, bears...they all make an appearance in this restaurant in the form of multi-colored piatas.

I think the food here is really good.  I LOVED the chips and salsa and ordered a bean burrito enchilada style for my meal ( I know, boring!).  My boyfriend ordered their lunch special, which was $6 for an enchilada, rice and beans.  My burrito ended up being around $5 something, but it was huge.  

Their happy hour starts at 3pm, and they have some great specials.  $2 margaritas!! Woo hoo! I was extremely tempted, but since I was drinking later on, I passed.  

I can tell this place doesn't get that much business yet...I think it's because they're located in the back of a shopping plaza and you'd have to be in the shopping plaza to even see them, so they probably don't get any drive-by traffic.  In my opinion, I think Pinata Nueva is way better than Macayo's and just as good as Carlos O'Brien's, if not better. Give it a try!"
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Build-a-Bear workshop is such a cute place for kids...and adults!  It's a fun activity especially for little ones because they get to be a big part in putting together the bear of their choice.  

They get to choose pretty much everything about the bear, and even whether it's a bear or not.  They have other animals the kids can choose, and even those Shrek babies now too.

Kids choose the clothing they want their bear to wear, they get some stuffing and they're good to go!

I made the mistake of taking this little girl I was babysitting here one day (I hope her mom doesn't read this) and it was one of the most embarassing moments ever.  She had this really weird specific idea of what she wanted her bear to wear, and of course, they didn't have that outfit.  She wanted a green princess dress with pink bows and when she found out that they didn't have it, she threw the bear and it hit one of the employees.  Then she threw herself on the ground and started screaming ""I hate you,"" to no one in particular.  

Then everyone looked at me, and I had no idea what to do.  I tried to get her up off the ground, but that made her scream louder.  Then she started screaming that I was hurting her.  

It truly was Build-a-bear gone wrong.  I finally got her out of the store, but not before every single customer, including a few employees gave me and the little girl I was babysitting dirty looks. 

I vowed to never babysit again, but I will give Build-a-Bear another try some day."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"I went to ASU for 3 years and left with a degree in English Literature.  And let me tell you, I can attest to the fact that the academics at ASU are up to par.  When you're taking 400 and 500 level Shakespeare classes from professors who continually challenge and inspire you, you know without a doubt that this is more than a party school. 

While some majors might be blow-offs, mine sure wasn't.  The professors cared if you came to class or not and usually gave you 5 absences before you got kicked out permanently.  They were serious about this too and took attendance every class.  This meant that I unfortunately, was not one of those students that got the option of skipping class very often. This is just what happens when you're an English Lit. major.

The campus is pretty big and it can sometimes be hard to make it to your next class in the 10 minutes you get if you schedule one after another.  The MU is nice, the campus is kept up well and you have a ton of choices for food, from Pizza Hut to Jamba juice.

I hated going down palm walk because the religious zealots were always there to tell me I was going to hell, but other than that, I had a great time at ASU, balancing going out with friends, working and getting a great education, all at the same time. 

PS- if you get the chance to take an African Lit./Slave narrative course, choose Montye Fuse. He was my favorite professor.  He's extremely challenging and expects a lot, but if you want to improve as a writer, he will help you."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Have you ever been peed on by a Siberian tiger? I have, but let's get to that in a minute.

First things first: tickets are $18 per person, but if you happen to know someone that buys Hickman eggs (which I do) you can get a coupon off of the back for a buy one get one free deal.  Not bad at all.

This is the best zoo I've ever been to. Hands down. It was amazing. You are able to get very close to the animals, which is cool and a little scary.

Back to the pee incident- I was about a foot away from the Siberian tiger and the only thing separating me from him was a fence.  He was pacing back and forth and everyone was remarking on how cool it was to see him up close until....wait for it...
he sprayed a few people, myself included with urine or his man tiger scent. Whatever you might call it, it was sick and pretty funny all at the same time. 

After dousing myself with water, we moved on to the rest of the zoo.  My boyfriend and I fed giraffes and monkeys, rode on the sky ride, took a train ride through a little portion of the zoo, saw 2 two-month old baby tigers and fed goats and llamas in the petting zoo.  

They have a ton of really cool, exotic animals here that you get to see up and close and personal- something that doesn't happen at most other zoos.  I didn't try any of the food at the snack bars or cafes, but they have a few, so you definitely have the option of having lunch or an early dinner there.

The zoo is 55 acres I believe and is open from 9am to 5pm.  It's the coolest thing ever, so check it out."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Los Compadres is awesome. Seriously. Great Mexican food and great prices from a family owned business.  Although this isn't a full service restaurant, I would still rather eat here than any other Mexican food restaurant in the Valley.  The way it works here is you order at the counter and then they call your number when everything is ready.  They have the best bean burritos known to man here- I dare you to challenge me on this. I know my mom really likes their tacos too, but I haven't tried one myself.  Although I normally come for dinner, they do have some really great lunch specials every day of the week as well. My only regret is that I don't live closer to the splendor that is Los Compadres.  On a side note for those that live in the area: does anyone know the name of the Chinese restaurant next door?  If so, I beg of you, don't eat there. My mom and I were getting out of her car one day to go to Los Compadres and we saw something that haunts us to this day. A driver was unloading what was sure to become someone's Moo Shu Pork, but at that point, they were still whole pigs! Whole pigs uncovered and stacked on top of each other in the back of this dirty delivery truck! I'm talkin' pig on top of pig on top of pig. They had nothing below them, nothing on top of them and nothing to cover them. For God's sake people, these pigs didn't even have saran wrap on them. It really gives new meaning to the word 'swine.' Anyways, even if I've saved just one person from eating at this slum, it will all have been worth it."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"This is a great thrift store with proceeds going to an even greater cause. The Sojourner Center provides housing and assistance to women and children that have been victims of domestic violence.

This thrift store is a way for them to fund their cause.  They run on donations and I was told that they let women from the shelter come and get clothes from it for free.  The rest of the time, customers come in and shop at amazing discounts.

I didn't really check out the clothes section or anything, and the place was more than a tad unorganized.  But that's how it is a lot of the time with thrift stores, so I guess that's what makes a great find even better.

I did however, check out the book section and it was AMAZING!  They had the best books here of any thrift store I've gone to. And guess how much they were?  25 cents.  25 CENTS!!!!

They had boxes of books laying on the floor that hadn't even been put on the shelf yet. I gladly went through them. I found ""The Lovely Bones,"" ""Saffron Skies,"" ""In her Shoes,"" ""The House of Sand and Fog,"" and quite a few others (around 10 more) and bought them all for a freaking quarter each.  If I had purchased them at a bookstore, it would have cost me over $100. Crazy.  

My mom also found a box of children's books.  I'm talking books that looked like maybe they'd been read once, if that.  And they couldn't have been more than a year old.  Brand new, shiny children's books for a quarter.  She works at the Day School for the Deaf, so she was able to buy the pre-schoolers a bunch of great books for practically nothing.

See?  Everyone wins when you shop at Sojourner Thrift!"
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Finally went to Green last night for the first time and LOVED it.  The food is all vegan/vegetarian and it's awesome.  They have quite a few choices on the menu, much of which is made with mock chicken or beef. You can also get crispy tofu or fresh tofu in most anything too.

You order at the counter, and the staff is super friendly. We got the samosas for an appetizer.  They were pretty tasty, although a little mushy inside.  The sauce they came with was delish. 

Although there are tasty looking bowls and pasta on the menu, I got the Original ""g"" po' boy and my boyfriend got the Mum's meatball po'boy.  Mine was sooo good and really spicy.  The sauce on the mock chicken was awesome and the thyme fries are delicious.  My boyfriend loved his too, and the few bites I had of his sandwich were definitely enjoyable. He got the curry pasta salad with his and really liked it. 

We decided to try out a Soynami too- which is soy ice cream mixed with organic ingredients.  We chose the Newman's chocolate cookies with chocolate sauce.  Really good. 

The food was great, and the best part is that it's super cheap.  Our sandwiches were only $6.50.  That's crazy! Our app was $3.50- even crazier!

I talked with one of the employees and he told me that they have plans to get a liquor license and once that happens, they will become a full service restaurant. 

The decor of the place is pretty cool too.  They have artwork lining the walls, including one titled ""Penis bites man.""  Hmm.

I really liked their lighting- it gave the place an intimate feel. 

I will definitely be back and I recommend it to anyone and everyone- not just vegetarians."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Eh.  Went to BB yesterday around 5ish for a Pucker promotion...It was the first stop in about 5 bars for our Pucker gay pride bar crawl and it was my first time there.  I wasn't really impressed.

The staff was very friendly and helpful, including the owner, but the server I had was pretty sloooow and a little out of it. We asked for bottle Miller Lite's, we got draft.   

And she took away the ashtray while my friend was smoking.  She left him sitting there with the ash about to fall everywhere while she took 5 minutes to get him a new one.  Maybe this is the server in me, but when you take an ashtray away to clean it, you put a new, clean one down first. 

I thought the bathroom was cool, but perhaps a bit dingy. The ceiling had glow in the dark paint on it, and I really enjoyed that for some reason. 

A lady asked me to put a Pucker sticker on her boob. I did. 

We decided to give the burgers a whirl, but my pal and I both subsituted the meat for a garden patty.  I think it's awesome that they actually give customers that option in the first place- not thaaat many restaurants remember the vegetarians of the world- but Burger Betty's does and that's great.

I got the original betty with cheese and my friend got the garlic burger.  The food took forever and a day to come out and although there were about 50 people in the joint, I only saw one other table with food. What was the hold up?  It took about 45-50 minutes. For a garden burger and some fries? What the heck? 

And it cost a $1 extra to exchange your meat patty for a garden burger. I thought that was a little silly.

All in all, I'd have to say that the burger was just okay.  But the fries were really good- oh and the beer was only $1.75 for a huge draft Miller Lite.  3 stars for Betty."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"I lived in Desert Club apartments for over two years and I really liked them. I moved in not long after they opened, so I got an amazing deal and an apartment that had never been lived in yet. The kitchen and bathroom had real tile, the kitchen counters were granite and the bathtub was of the roman variety- it was freaking awesome. I loved, loved, loved taking baths in it.  The maintenance was always really good about fixing anything that went wrong quickly and the grounds always looked great too. My only complaints- halfway through my time at DC, management changed and so did the desire to keep residents happy.  With sooo many luxury apartment rentals in the area, you would think Desert Club would want to keep up the amenities and the other little things that would make their apartments stand out from the rest- but this just wasn't the case.  The workout room- once quite a bonus to living there- became pretty worthless.  It used to be awesome, every piece of workout equipment came with its own little TV and if you brought your own headphones, you could watch Mtv or anything else you wanted while you worked out.  Well, one by one the TV's stopped working and instead of fixing or replacing them, the management would have them removed.  Also, at any given time, probably only one of the treadmills worked, so it became a matter of getting there at the right time or you'd have to wait awhile to workout.  They also stopped replacing light bulbs. And the parking was horrendous. Anytime I had a friend come over, I would tell them to bring their hiking shoes- that's how far away they had to park. I would still recommend this place, but I would definitely check the other apartments in the area first that are comparable in price because you can probably find apartments just as great that having more parking and better management."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"I went to Saba's feeling a little scared.  Fast food Greek in a strip mall?  This could go one of two ways...surprisingly good or health code violation bad.  

I am very glad to say it didn't end being the latter.  In fact, the food here was pretty damn good.  I did expect Saba's to be an order at the counter joint, so I was a little disappointed to see it was actually a tiny restaurant.  I like my Greek fast and cheap, okay?  But I got over it, got a table and began the interminable wait for our server to stop chatting with other diners and take our order.

The menu has all the normal Greek items, including falafel- little fried balls of joy I might add- gyros, vegetarian platters, spanakopita and dolmas.  Prices for the sandwiches and gyros are pretty cheap, but when you venture into the platter territory, you're going to pay for it. Platters start around $10 and go up.  I ordered the falafel, of course, and so did my boyfriend.  The pita sandwiches don't come with any sides, so we ordered a basket of fries to go along with our meal.

The dcor was pretty cool with big pictures of Greece all over the walls and the classic Greek music piped in.  Unfortunately, not even the Greek music could mask the hideous, loud tool of a diner that was sitting at the table in front of me. He was one of those idiots that has to talk so loud, even the half-deaf cook in the kitchen can hear him.  He was so loud I felt like I should respond to his questions.  Hey moron- saying things like ""I like it loose, like my women,"" is just not funny.

Anyways, when we finally got our food, it was really good.  The falafel pita and the fries were tasty, but our server sucked.  He obviously knew the loud tool, and kept chatting with him while we waited for our check.  That was a little annoying, but overall, Saba's is a good choice for a quick Greek meal."
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Halo Thrift Store might not be well known, but it's one of the best thrift stores in Arizona.  It's run completely by volunteers and proceeds go to helping local animals.  

Halo stands for Helping Animals Live On and they even have pets up for adoption on their website. Halo takes animals off of death row from the county and places them in foster care until a permanent home can be found for them.  They're trying to save up money to open up a shelter, but so far, they haven't made enough to go toward their goal.

That's where you come in!  Every time you shop in Halo, you'll put them one step closer toward being able to save even more animals from death. I know recently they were thinking that they might have to close their doors because their thrift store wasn't making enough to keep it open.  So hopefully you'll take the time to stop in Halo, do some shopping and help out a really great organization- it's a fantastic and worthy place to spend your money.  

The thrift store itself is small, but very well maintained.  You can find some great treasures in it and the best part is that My Sister's Closet donates clothes, jewelry and shoes to them to sell in Halo.  This means that they have fantastic brand names at HUGE savings.  They have Neiman Marcus tops, Ralph Lauren handbags, Hollister tank tops and much, much more!

 They have clothes, books, shoes, home decor items, animal products and more, but their boutique section is my favorite.  Since they also get donations from some pretty ritzy people, they often have really nice designer bags and clothes in their boutique.  The prices are fantastic- you can get a designer bag that looks brand new for under $10.  

You can also find some cool pieces of furniture, paintings, toys, animal clothing and much more here.  This is definitely a thrift store you don't want to miss. 

If you haven't been, you definitely need to check this place out.
You'll be doing something good for animals and yourself too!"
sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"There is something about Yelp that compels me to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.  So before I get to the bad, I'll tell you about the good. Kyoto is so fun.  I've been going there for years and it's pretty much a guaranteed good time- especially if you sit at a cooking table.  Keep in mind that the cooking tables really fill up quickly, so if you're looking to get one for a larger party for a Friday or Saturday night, you definitely need to get that reservation in early on in the week. Smaller parties can usually be squeezed in to the tables without thaaat long of a wait.  

The environment is always lively at Kyoto- maybe it's the sake...I don't really know. But this is definitely not the spot for a quiet, romantic dinner.  People are always yelling, laughing and talking very loudly here and it's often the scene for birthday and graduation celebrations.

In fact, when it's your birthday, they bring out something I can only describe as a washcloth shaped weener with a cherry on top. They also sing and give you a coffee mug that has pictures of sushi all around it.  

I got this mug a few years ago and after a few shots, found it so funny that I became absolutely determined not to lose it during the night ahead of me. I somehow (and I say this with great pride) kept that mug in my bag the whole night and still have it today.  

I think the food is good at Kyoto too and the sushi is pretty decent.  But the fried rice is what dreams are made of.  Try it and you'll know what I mean. My best friend and I used to go to Kyoto some nights before we went out and sit at the bar with a drink in one hand and a bowl of fried rice in the other. Forget the cooking tables- that's all we needed. 

Now I have to end this review on a bad note, but keep in mind that although it took me about a year to return after the 'incident,' I still did return nonetheless and still go to Kyoto on occasion.  This happened probably five years ago, but I will never forget it. My friend and I ordered sake and were pouring it into the little sake glass when we noticed something black had poured out with it.  A horrified little peak into the glass revealed it was a large, hideous roach! AAAAARGH. It still freaks me out. The glass was thrown and we made quite a scene, but upon telling the bartender, the only response he gave back to us was ""well, was it alive?"" DOES IT MATTER? 

He comped us two gin and tonics and sent us on our way and that was that.  I know from working in the service industry that all restaurants and clubs have roaches, it's just a fact of life. You can do your best to maintain it, but those little bastards keep on coming. I don't completely blame Kyoto or think the place is infested with roaches but it still was a little traumatizing for someone that is deathly afraid of those hideous monsters.  It took me awhile to return, but I still go, I just won't order the sake. If you do, please do me a favor and look in the little sake bottle before you pour it."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"I've been here many times for dinner, but not buffet.  This review is for the lunch buffet.

There were many items in the buffet line, ranging from vegetarian to meat courses. 

The quality and taste of the dishes exceed my expectations even more now.  I love goat karahi.  I have been to many Indian restaurants where the goat karahi isn't consistent.  I know I can count on Mint to make sure that each piece is tender and flavorful.  I mixed my tender chunks of goat meat with slices of onions and cucumbers, then squeezed lemon on them and tossed it around some more. It was delicious, and the naan was great as well.  

However, goat karahi wasn't the only star on today's menu (according to me, of course).  I have tried tandoori chicken at many places, but I find it lacks flavor.  When Debbie said that the tandoori chicken is her favorite, I decided to grab a piece to give it a try.  Boy was I glad Debbie raved about it.  It was SOOOOO GOOOOD!  I tore off a piece of this delicious chicken that bursted with flavor and put it on top of freshly baked garlic naan. I then dipped it into the tamarind chutney and wala, yummy-in-my-tummy.  

I was full at this point, but still had to eat my favorite dessert, khir.  I was super excited to see this in the  buffet line.  I love the basmati rice, slow cooked in milk with a dash of cardamom.  I got two servings, one for Roland, and one for myself.  Somehow, they both ended up being consumed by me...Oops...Khir...I can't help myself.

I also had the Lal Mohan.  Again, tried this at other places, never liked it.  Luckily, Debbie also raved about this so I gave it a shot...thank goodness I tried it because it is DELICIOUS.

And the staff, attentive and friendly, as always."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"After seeing how long the line was to get into the Asian Night Market, Hubby, our 3.5 yo and I decided to try out Jjanga since it's close by, we wanted sushi (well the 3.5 yo wanted French fries) and Jjanga has over 1K reviews at 4.5 stars on Yelp.  Anyways, it was about 7:30pm, and we had to wait for about 15 mins before we got seated.  I was told that there isn't a kid's menu and if my tot wanted to do AYCE, it's half the price of that of an adult price, so about 13-14$.   We decided on 2 adults AYCE and an order of French fries.  We started with all the 1 order per person items, but the oysters and sweet shrimp was never delivered to our table, and we asked about the order 3 times, to 2 different servers that came by our table to see how we were doing.  They had toro that night (1 nigiri per person), but I didn't enjoy it very much as it was missing the fattiness that I was expecting.  We usually don't order hot foods or rolls, but we did here and all were a disappointment.  Hubby ordered a roll that supposed to have soft shell crab inside.  When we got the roll, it looked like the fake crab crap so he inquired with our server.  She said that the spicy crab is already premade and when we ordered, that's when they roll it.  It does not look like soft shell crab to us but at that point, we were beyond disappointed.  They charge extra for quail eggs.  I immediately compared them to Goyemon because Goyemon doesn't charge extra for those kinds of items.  

Hubby didn't even want me to write a review because he thinks it is embarrassing for folks to know we dined here, but I had to write...to warn others that if you want quality raw fish, don't come here.  You like the cooked stuff or rolls, try Jjanga at your discretion."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"What a way to spend our Sunday afternoon and our moolah on the Restaurant Week special menu lunch at Poppy Den!  Earl and I got the following:

1st Course-Tomato Soup:  Layers of flavor.  Earl, who is not a tomato kind of guy, loved this soup.  The Watermelon salad with goat cheese was very delicious too.  The goat cheese was of great quality, and I love the crunchy wasabi that was added to this dish.

2nd Course-Earl and I both got the monkfish with onion jam and dill.  The fish was cooked to perfection.  The meat has the same texture as lobster.  

3rd Course-Strawberry Sake Shortcake: We liked the black pepper whipped cream on top of this shortcake.  Other than that, it was pretty plain to me.  The Chips and Icecream was interesting.  The chips were a tad too salty for me.  The lemon poppy icecream was pretty good.  Only gripe is that there wasn't much icecream or chips, compared to another table that was ahead of us, who also did the restaurant week spring menu.  Upon inquiry, we were told that the amount of icecream and chips on that dessert will be the new quantity on that dessert.

Service was awesome!  Our waitress was very friendly and personable.  Added to this memorable fun lunch was to have it with an awesome group of people.  Lots of fun and laugh.  Additionally, we got to take pictures with Angelo Sosa!!!  I was hoping that we will see him today too.  Based on the conversation we had with him, he stays in Vegas one week out of the month...just so glad he decided to come today!  He is super friendly, personable, and awesome as well.

Based on the food alone, it would have been a 4 star review.  However, the service more than made up for the last deserving star.

It's a 5 star experience that I will not forget!"
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"I absolutely enjoyed my dinner here on a Saturday evening, thank you Marrakech for having a groupon deal.

Our servers were very attentive.  Based on the prior reviews, I was a bit hesitant but glad I decided to see for myself.

The food was delicious.
1st-Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi: love the lemon wine garlic sauce.  We were dipping the moroccan bread pieces into this flavorful sauce that I had to keep reminding myself not to overdo it since there are 5 more courses to come.  The shrimps were small but cooked perfectly.

2nd-Harira Soup:  this was really good!  I can gulp down 2 bowls of this lentil soup!

3rd-Marrakech Sampler: hummus, eggplant/tomato dip, olives, cucumbers, beets and carrots.  Nothing special

4th-Beef Brochette:  a skewer of tender beef, very tender and has good flavor.  I was pretty full at this point so I ate one chunk and the rest was eaten by my bf.

5th-Chicken couscous (Morrocan Style): The chicken was tender over couscous.  An extra bowl of gravy was brought out in case we wanted more gravy on our dish.  We tasted some of this dish and ask for it to go.  So So full.

6th-B'stilla and hot Morrocan mint tea:  Oh wow, this fluffy pastry, wrapped with filo dough was so yummy with the mint tea.  I wonder if I can just come and have the fluffy pastry and mint tea...that would be awesome.  Anywho, the fluffy pasty was filled with chocolate and almonds, topped with more almonds, powdered sugar and cinnamon.  So good.

The bellydancers were great.  However, since we enjoy our conversation with each other, the music can be a tad bit loud.  

Conclusion:  I probably wouldn't pay $40 dinner for one.  It was a great dinner and experience but not for that price.  Therefore, I am a fan when there is such a deal."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"I woke up this morning and was super hungry.  I felt like Nordstrom Cafe, but they were closed...Thanksgiving after all.  So I figured Yi Mei Taiwan Champion Deli would be open to get some of that freshly fried chinese donuts (oil Sticks) and dip it into warm soybean milk.  Nope, they were closed as well...WTH, they are taiwanese!!!  So anyways, Southpoint is right across the street, so we'll just go to their breakfast buffet.

It was cheap, 2 can have breakfast for $15.03 + $3 tip.
They didn't have my favorite breakfast item though.  It's the smoked salmon topped with capers on top of a cream cheesed bagel.  They had the salmon scrambled eggs (although this one taste better than the one I had bought at New Day Cafe, and is cheaper here too).  

They have the regular breakfast item...nothing stood out...oh wait, their fruits were limited to apples, bananas, oranges, and thawed berries (hence, not fresh).

I had a small bowl of grits mixed with eggs, some salt and pepper, with a slice of wheat toast and was done.

What I didn't like was the fact when I was in line, there was a big kid that cut everyone and grabbed some bacon and placed it on his unclean plate.  Come on people...don't you read the regulation?  You are suppose to use a clean plate each time you go to get more food!!!  What's even more disgusting is that I saw a little kid, about 7 or so (in the age limit where there should be adult supervision!!), dug his hand into the bread basket, and touched one too many bread, and finally grabbed the prized bread to spread the land o lakes whipped butter on!  Parents!!!!  Please communicate to your children the etiquette, or simply comply with the regulation!!!!

Anyways, service was ok.  It's cheap, but I will be eating a breakfast bar instead."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"I was looking for a dependable place to get my wedding dress and my maid of honor's dress altered.  One of my friend recommended this place since she used it in the past and she said service was good (later learned that it was a simple hem).

The husband and wife are friendly, and they have a cute doggy named Lily.  But that's about it.  The work is...not that of a 'MASTER TAILOR' as noted on her business cards.  The MOH dress was promised to be done a certain day, but when we arrived, we found out that the dress has not been worked on.  Dress and ribbon was still in its original form as when we first dropped it off.  Newt clearly didn't write down the details of what needed to be done during the consultation.  On top of that, I had prepaid for all the work that needs to be done!  So anyways, we came back a week later to pick it up.  Incompetency was revealed when we asked for a particular spot to be hemmed, she quickly said that she couldn't do it.

Now onto my wedding dress.  The day came for me to come by to try it on.  Well, after I put it on, there was a 'pouch.'  We asked Newt if she can get rid of the 'pouch' since it was definitely not me having the pouch.  She said no she cannot.  Incompetency #2 was revealed then.

Are you freakin' kidding me?  A week until my wedding and I am stuck with this unflattering dress and a so called Master Tailor can't do a damn thing about! 

My MOH came to the rescue.  She called her tailor, referred me, I walked in, less than a week later, I had a custom fitted dress that doesn't have a pouch.  It was the same dress that Newt cannot altered, but Almasa at Europin was able to work her magic.  

Conclusion: Tailors should be certified before they can use ""Master Tailor.""  In this case, I will never ever go back to Newts for anything."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"I just had to be an Indian foodie today.  Lunch buffet at India Palace, now dinner at Jai Ho.

-Chicken corn soup:  Was very creamy and flavorful.  The sweetness of the corn paired with chunks of chicken made this bowl of soup so good.  Because we like it a  bit hot, we asked for some soy sauce and hot sauce.  This took the soup to a whole different level. 

-Goat Karahi:  yep yep, love my goat.  The first bite I had, it was a bit tough.  I was a  bit disappointed.  But nope, I didn't stop there, I can't give up on it yet.  I took another bite, it was more tender.  So what did I do...I was on a hunt for the more tender pieces in the pot.  I wish they were ALL tender.  It's ok.  I might not order this again though.

-Chicken Tikka:  I am used to more flavorful chicken tikka (I am from Houston where there are many indo-pak restaurants...)

-Keema Naan:  It was decent

-Garlic Naan:  lots of garlic on this naan.  Very good.

-Kulfi Faluda:  I have been on a hunt for a Faluda ever since I came to Las Vegas.  This has been the only place that have something similar.  The icecream that was given to me was the pistachio icecream (hence the kulfi in the name).  I am used to the vanilla icecream.  It changes the flavor by alot.  Don't get me wrong, it's still good, but just not as good as I remembered it.

The server actually gave us a free order of chicken boti because he did not mention to us that the chicken tikka may take 25 mins since they made to order.  This free order was actually my favorite.  The chicken was nice and tender.  I place this on a garlic naan, some onion, a squeeze of lime, then dunk this bad boy in the tamarind chutney sauce and WALLA!  Made my night!

Service: 5 stars!
Food: super close to 4 stars!

Results:  Definitely recommend and I will come back Fo SHo!"
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"I came here for a mani&pedi and upon arrival, I was greeted by the friendly receptionist.  The salon looks very clean and contemporary, which is a good sign.  The person who worked on my nails usually does hair but since it's summer, she also does mani&pedi since there are more clients wanting to get their nails done.  While she fills up a water basin for me to soak my feet in, I head on over to the nail polish bowl and the racks on the wall to chose my color.  They have a selection of OPI (love them), Creative, china Glaze, and *Something* Philosophy...the chair I sat on was very comfy, with rollers that massaged my back.  My nail tech for the hour was very friendly, it's like talking to your girlfriend, only in this case, I prolly won't be chatting with her again, and here are some pros and cons:

PROS:
-I really wanted to tip her 20% because she is super friendly, so after seeing that my whole fingernails are not completely painted and seeing that there are clumps on one of them, I asked her to repaint.  She tried her best to repaint the nails to my liking.  
-She provided me with slippers that are easy to slide my feet into so that my toe nails won't be messed up.

CONS:
-My cuticles were not snipped off at all.  I KNOW they need to be done. 
-Although she sprayed my nails to make them dry quicker, I was told that I am all set to go too soon...Why? because the paint on my fingernails were all messed up as soon as I left the salon.  Boo.  I really liked the color, so will be stopping by a store to find that same color to do my nails.

There you have it.  This is an ok place to go to all in all.  However, I find that it is better if I do my own nail since I like to have my entire nail painted and have time to wait until they are completely dry at the comfort of my own home."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"It was last Thursday that I decided to chew on a caramel chocolate covered nuts and my crown decided to come off of my tooth.  My tooth was sensitive to everything, including sipping water.  I was in panic mode because I currently don't have insurance because I am still in my 90 day probationary period until March 2013.  I called Dr. Phan's office.  Receptionist Nemi picked up the phone and let me know she will call me back to see if she can squeeze me in since the day is pretty much booked.  An hour later, she called me to let me know to visit the office at 5pm.  When I arrived, we figured out that the crown was done by the previous dentist, way before I knew of Dr. Phan.  Then I thought, of course it can't be Dr. Phan's doing.  His work is flawless.  On top of that, it was the same crown that Doc Phan had advise me to get it redone at year end 2011, because there is a small gap that will cause problem in the long run.  Boy was he right about that.  

Instead of turning me away for 1.) imperfect work that was performed by another dental office and 2.) me not having insurance, Dr. Phan and the entire staff of Town & Country Dental welcomed me with open arms.  They took the time to have my crown back where it should be.  My mind was in la la land due to how appreciative I was of the office, that I didn't follow direction.  I didn't bite down hard enough on the bite stick.

On Friday, I texted Doc about my off-bite, he asked me to swing by the office at 5pm so he can adjust it.  I went by the office again, they welcomed me yet again.  My bite was perfect.

I feel very indebted to the entire staff of Town & Country Dental because at the time of need, when I don't have insurance, they did not turn me away.  Instead, they treated me with kindness and restore my bite.  I will be a patient of Doc Phan fo life."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"Last night after an unsuccessful attempt to go to the Bollywood Gala event, we decided to give this Vietnamese Place a try.  I yelped and seeing that it is on average 4 stars, I must taste it out for myself.  

1.) Grilled Pork Summer Rolls-The menu stated that it includes grilled pork sausage, veggies, as well as the crunchy rice crisps...(I have this type of rolls over at Bosa 1 all the time).  I was hungry and was looking forward to this appetizer.  I was very dissappointed, there was NO RICE CRISPS!  This ingredient would make these rolls so much better!!  What a shame!!  and also, the dipping sauce was just no right for it.  I am giving this appetizer 2 stars.  Will not order this again.

2.) MaiLan Spicy Beef Noodle-thick rice noodles, beef shank, beef tendon and pork hock soup in a chili lemongrass beef broth.  This is one of my favorite noodle, but I was a bit dissappointed because there was no pork hock in my soup (my favorite item in the soup, what I look forward to eat last to savor it).  BoooooOOOOoo. I will definitely ask for it if I order it again.  Flavor was nice but so sad... 3 stars

3.) MaiLan Combination Special-this is the beef noodle soup with the combination of meat (round-eye steak, well-done brisket, tendon, tripe, and meatball...yes, meatball.  Normally, you have to order meatball as extra and isn't included in the combination.  This is the first restaurant that included it, which I am pleasantly surprise).  Now I am Vietnamese and have been eating Pho as I am growing up.  This broth was so flavorful, like how my mom used to make it...aahhh, mom's food.  How i miss it.  Anyways, this is now my go-to place when I want some pho.  5 STARS!!!

Conclusion
Service:  Wonderful.  They were very nice.
Food:  Pho is wonderful.  
Will I come back:  Of course for an authentic bowl of PHO!!!"
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"I really enjoyed this place.  I am not one to go to lounges/bars since I don't care for alcohol.  However, we decided to go because it is our friend's friend birthday and Earl had not been here before (I've been here with Debbie for a Cochon event).  We arrived a bit after 9:30pm and it wasn't crowded.  We were able to move around freely.  After looking at the menu, I was surprise that the prices were decent...or so I thought because when I made a comment that wow, this drink is only $10 (in my surprise voice), Nate said ""Earl, you need to take her out more often.""  I was totally comparing the prices to Jaleo's and Rose.Rabbit.Lie's prices and anything less than those places I would think is good, due to the fact that those were the only 2 places that I ever remembered reading the drink prices.  

Both Annie and I settled for the Moscow Mule.  It was DEE-LICIOUS.  Then a kind staff pointed to an area where we may lounge around.  After a while, we decided to hit up the rooftop patio.  It was a bit chilly at first but after warming up under the heat lamp and Moscow mule kicking in, I warmed up.  Well, my face was red but that didn't stopped me from accepting another Moscow Mule from Annie.  Um um um..yummy I tell ya.  This night was the most I have drank in a long time.  

The vibe was great.  We liked it because people can be as dressy, or as casual as they please.  The music blazing on the rooftop was pretty awesome too.  There was a mix of everything.  People can dance if they want to as well.

The only minus I would say is that we had a table but we were somewhat scooted away since the bouncer or whoever he was suppose to be, was flashing his flashlight and lead a group of people to the table that we were surrounding.

Anywho, Earl and I will be taking my brother-in-law to Commonwealth when he comes to visit us.  We are fans!"

Thali Price Alert! Thali Price Alert!

The Thali is no longer $5.99.  It is $7.99.  There has been a $2 increase.  So I told my whole team that it was only $5.99 for a plate of vegetarian ethnic yumminess, based on the Yelp reviews.  When we arrived, I noticed that the where it was supposed to be $5.99, it was covered with a piece of paper with $7.99 written on it.
Boo, I gave false information to my whole team :(

Nonetheless, we all had Thali.  The sweet little lady took precious time (a bit slow for our liking since we had to get back to work) to prepare each tray with whatever she want to put on it.  My tray consisted of the following:
-mashed spinach: doesn't look appetizing, but tasted ok.  I only ate a few bites of this.
-eggplant curry:  was delicious and tasty.  I finished this.
-squash something:  I finished this too.  It was very refreshing.
-tofu something:  was decent, but not as flavorful.  There were three cubes of tofu in this compartment.
-basmati rice with peas-the rice taste good.
-purple onion slices with spicy mango sauce: this was supposed to be the pickle veg on the menu.  Well, it doesn't really taste like it would sound.  We all thought the sauce tasted like pinesol.  We didn't touch this on our tray.
-roti: tasted like tortilla.  I should have asked for paratha.

The milk tea and purified water was complimentary.
I give this a 4 star.

Grocery Store Review:
My co-worker picked up a bag of naan and a bottle of lychee drink from the grocery side.  When she was about to pay for it and flipped over the bag of naan, those visible naans were moldy blue in color.  The guy that was about to ring it up took it and throw it away.  People, make sure you inspect the goods before making a purchase.  Sometimes, we tend to not look at it until we are about to enjoy the food.
I give this a 3 star.

Overall: 3.5 star place"
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"Because the french onion soup at YardHouse did not satisfy me and I remembered that the french onion soup at Outback Steakhouse was pretty yummy, I asked my fiancee to take me there.  Initially, he thought I wanted steak so he suggest we go to the steakhouse at Green Valley Ranch.  I told him that Outback has the 4 course meal for $15, which is a steal!  Not really when you consider the quality of food served to you.

Both Earl and I opted to pay a supplementary charge of $8 to get the 6 oz Victoria Center Cut Filet.  It supposed to be tender, but guess what?  Mine had the sinue, which made it tough and chewy as hell.  I tried really hard to cut the sinue off, but ended up having Earl cut it  off for me.  C'mon now Outback...Can you really call it ""tender"" with that piece of crap it it?

I also paid the $1 upgrade to change the walkabout soup of the day to my french onion soup.  At least that was good.  Earl had the walkabout soup, which is lentil and sausage soup.  He commented that it's a good thing I didn't get that soup because it tastes like crap.  When it came time for dessert, there are only two choices to chose from, the cheesecake or the carrot cake.  We took that home and I did not enjoy the cheesecake.  What kind of cheesecake does not have a crust?  This crappy cheesecake at Outback Steakhouse.  WTF?  Seriously people.  Stick with the crust because this noncrust cheesecake is crap.

Now service...CRAPPY as well.  The server breath smells bad.  Every time he talks, I have to gasp for air in a different direction.  Additionally, he happened to left his drink tray on our table while tending to other guests.  WTF again.  After he took a table's order, gave another table their to go boxes, clean some plates off of another table, he then picked up that drink tray without saying one word to us.  

The night's dinner experience was crappy, nonetheless, I am OUT and never come BACK."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"Hubby asked where I would like to have dinner before I go back to work since my maternity leave is coming to an end.  Without hesitation, I said, ""Kame.""  There are 2 seating, one at 6 and one at 8pm, M-Th.  We chose the 8pm on Thursday.

Chef Eric and team created over 20 different items for us to enjoy and EVERY SINGLE ITEM was of the freshest quality, flavorful, and we could truly taste the essence of the item.  There are other omakase places out there where you are given many items, but not all are great.  You may like a few items that were offered.  Nopee, not here at Kame.  Every single item was unique and delicious.  

There were items that I have tasted before (i.e., raw lobster with uni, truffle caviar and gold flakes, lobster miso soup, hairy crab rice with uni, roe, fatty tuna, melt in your mouth fatty tuna, three different types and style of oysters, scallop sashimi, etc), others that I have not tasted before (i.e., black throat sea perch nigiri, mullet fish roe, and more items that I can't remember the name of), right down to the unique and edible garnishments (mountain peach, cherry blossoms, fresh seaweed, fresh pickled ginger).  We finished the epic omakase with a scoop of delicious hojicha ice cream.

We learned a lot during this omakase, from Chef Eric.  Differences between the Santa Barbara and Japan uni, etc.  Chef Eric only gets shipment of the fish from the region that produces the best tasting of its kind, and will not settle for anything less than premium quality.  Quite honestly, though our omakase was $160pp (there is also the $120pp), the quality and quantity of our meal is worth way more than that price.  

Like the Joel Robuchon of the French cuisine, Jose Andres of the Spain cuisine, Chef Eric is the ONE representing Japanese cuisine.  Very knowledgeable, friendly, passionate, he is one of a kind.  His omakase is the ultimate omakase, and we will always return."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"Things to bring:
-facial cleanser: unless you want to use the spa supplied body wash for your face.
-shampoo, conditioner and body wash:  They do supply this in the shower area, no label but a dispenser with each type is noted.  Therefore, if you use a certain shampoo, conditioner and body wash, do bring your own.  
-facial moisturizer: unless you want to use the suave body lotion for your face.
-bath salt: they don't offer this for free when request at the front desk anymore.  

Things to remember to get from the front desk besides the big towel and bracelet with your locker number/lock attached:
-toothbrush
-razor
-slippers

Things to remember to do before going into the sauna/steam room:
-small towel, dip it into cold water, and cover your face because these rooms are sure to disorient you without that protection.

We saw half of the females in bathing suit and half naked.  We didn't appreciate a group of ladies decided to submerge themselves in the warm bath without taking a shower.  There are signs indicating to shower prior to enjoying the baths but clearly that group did not read.  Gross.  Good thing we had already dipped in that warm bath.

After we enjoyed the various baths and steam rooms and saunas downstairs, we head up to the second level (co-ed), and enjoyed all the rooms.  At the jade room, we put on a collagen mask.  After 20 minutes, we skedaddle over to the red clay room.  Looks like a bunch of furnaces, but Debbie and I decided that it's our favorite room.  While we were lying in these furnace like structure, ladies in the two other furnaces decided to socialize to get to know each other.  Again, there are signs posted out front for them to be quiet.    Whatevs.

When we got to the red clay balls room, we put on another cucumber mask and after 20 minutes of that, we made it to the final pit stop, the ice room.

Afterward, we head back down to the first level and rinse off.  Was a very relaxing 4 hours we spent at this spa.  Will definitely come back."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"Finally visited this place for the second time and a star bump this time around....service was great, and food was great.

Here is the breakdown:
-Appetizer: Queso Flameado: This is very yummy...Even better than the first time because instead of 3 tortillas, there were 4! Highly recommended if you like melted cheese with tons of flavor (combination of cheese, mushrooms, tomato and a green chile sauce)

-Entree: Chilean Seabass:  Wow, this was so good.  When I ate here the first time, I wasn't a fish person.  This time around, I was glad that I tried this entree.  The fish was super tasty and the fattiness just melts in your mouth.  Was perfectly seasoned and steamed to perfection.  The jalapeno cilantro lime marinade was the perfect marinade for this fatty fish.  yum yum yum.

-Entree: Prime Filet Mignon:  Nice cut, but over cooked.  We asked for medium rare, it came  out medium.  If only this was cooked to how we ordered, Mundo may have received 5 stars,  but that didn't happen.  However, the sauce was delicious.  

-Side: Mexican Risotto : I asked our server which side is the most popular and he recommended this side...we were kinda set on this side prior to asking him for recommendation, but I wanted to confirm that it's good.  Indeed it is!  This risotto had poblano chile, corn and cilantro.  Was very rich and creamy.

-Dessert: Banana Empanadas:  Again, recommendation by our server and yet again, a hit at our table.  It's batter-fried banana with caramel drizzled on top and a scoop of creamy icecream. Was the perfect way to finish this wonderful dinner.

-Drinks: Alien Margarita and Mojito:  The margarita was very good with the salt.  My favorite part of it is after the server pour the tequila from a small 'Alien' glass bottle, the bottle is for you to keep if you wish.  The mojita was nice and strong.

Overall, a 4-star dining experience.  Ambiance was great, the service was great (thank god we had a good server), the food was almost perfect.  Highly recommended."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"Hubby and I had our dinner here this past Friday and it was a night to remember.  For me, in particular, since I had three virgin cocktails, Garnet Gimlet (I should have had this over ice), Platinum Peacock (my fave, very refreshing), and Ruby Iced Tea (tart).  Hubby was a bit over-buzzed after The Woodson, Goose IPA, and the Garrison.  

Ranking from Most to Least Favorites:
1. Elote Style Scallops: Scallops were perfectly cooked on top of charred elote.  Delicous!
2. Black Bottomed Butterscotch Pot de Crème: Just the right amount of richness.  Ooh, a piece of heaven with this dessert.  The ganache at the bottom adds a different texture to this elevated pot de crème.  Came with a spoon shaped thin cookie wafer.  A must order dessert.
3. Hand Cut Steak Tartare: The steak tartare was on top of crispy sticky rice cakes.  This was quite unique and flavorful.
4. East and West Coast Oysters: Ordered the dozen and got to try all fresh raw oysters.  Very satisfying.
5. Roasted Bone Marrow: Spread the marrow on some grilled toast, then topped with coarse salt and shallots marmalade...Yum!
6. Yellowtail Sashimi: Latin spin on this plate.  The sashimi was topped with pickled jalapeno and the ponzu sauce gave it some acidity.  I had to really try hard to taste the fish, but the flavor profile was there.
7. Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon and Tomato Soup Dumpling: I liked this rendition.  The dumpling was nice and chewy.  
8. Caesar Toast: Exactly that, except there are pieces of crispy chicken skin.  It delivered, yet, I wasn't satisfied.
9. Orange Kissed Salmon Ceviche: When I think of Ceviche, I think of lime cured salmon.  This plate was just sweet.  It was missing the acidity that I am accustomed to, as well as salt.  A miss for me.
10. Kygo Cloud 9 S'Mores: WAY TOO RICH!  Need a glass of milk with this.  Overly sweet too.  Bleh!  

I must say that the dishes are pretty pricey for the quantity and quality offered, but I believe guests are paying for the location and ambiance.  Service was fantastic!"
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"I have gone here so many times and have been waiting to write a review.  Tonight, a friday night in which I have the cough and have nothing else better to do, is the night when I want to share with other yelpers the awesome-ness of this cafe.

I never really liked salad.  To me, it's too boring.  Boy was I wrong when I gobbled down the Mixed Berry Salad with chicken.  Now I have the love for this salad.  The combination of the different berries (strawberries, blackberries and raspberries), candied walnuts, crumbled blue cheese, mixed with lovely fresh greens and blackberry champagne vinaigrette over it is amazingly refreshing.  People who loves berries must try this.  oh so GOOD.

I've tried the tuscan chicken entree and the chicken I had was juicy and nice.  It comes with grilled veggies (potatoes, carrots, zucchinis and red bell pepper).  My bf ordered another time, and he said his chicken was dry though.  That sucks for him, but I enjoyed my food, please see below.

I had the.....drum roll please...GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH w/TOMATO BASIL SOUP!!!!!
yep yep, from the kid's menu, but i don't care.  It's super yummy to me.  I had the sourdough bread, in which you have the option of them making it using wheat bread.  The kid's meal comes with a drink (i chose oj) and a bowl of fresh fruit.  Guess how much does my favorite meal cost at this awesome cafe?  under $5 bucks!  

Their cookies are very big and good as well.  They are soft and chewy.  I had their triple chocolate brownie, it was decent, not something that i would order again though.  I have also tried their lemon bar.  It was refreshing.  My bf ate it and said it taste like a soap bar, but again, lemon isn't his flavor, why did I even bother to shove a piece down his throat...BECAUSE i want him to taste the yummy stuff that I taste.  O well, i will not waste anymore yummy stuff on someone who doesn't know how to savor lemony stuff.  Which means...MORE FOR ME!!!

The end of the meal, they give you chocolate mint sticks, which are fabulous, icing on the cake for me.  

Yum Yum Yum..."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"IMPECCABLE.  Food, service, staff, ambiance...everything was just impeccable.

We chose the 6 course dinner each and we were there from 5:30pm to 10:30pm.
-The L'Amuse-bouche:  a small bite that excited my palate.
Bread cart approached me and oh how I tried to so hard to limit myself to 3...we were given olive oil and salt sprinkled butter to enjoy with the bread.
-Soup: Delicate tofu velouté with lemon zest on warm seaweed gelée, smoked and caramelized eel.  This has layers and layers of flavor.
-Appetizer: langoustine ravioli with truffle, cream and chopped cabbage
-1st Main Course: Black Cod with a yuzu daikon velvet puree
**after the 1st main course, I was pretty full.
-2nd Main Course: Duck and seared foie gras with sweet and sour cherries, fresh almonds.  This dish was very delicious, but again, I was full at this point, I could not finish my plate.  I still had a piece of foie gras, and almost 2 pieces of duck left...I had to tap out.
**we ordered some hot tea to help us stay awake.  When we were ready, the cheese cart came by.
-Fromage:  So many different cheese!  Our awesome server brought out some fruits for us to enjoy with the cheese.  He was also kind enough to write down our favorite cheese on a piece of paper for our future reference.
-Dessert 1: Strawberry Daiquiri with yogurt sorbet and pop rocks - yummy yummy joy joy for my tummy.  Who knew pop rocks will elevate such dessert...GENIUS.  I loved it.
-Dessert 2:Raspberry milk mousse, spiced raspberry sorbet, earl grey puffed rice krispies and pistachio foam.  Ahhh, the pop rocks...oh wait, I was going to write about the Dessert 2...it was different.
-Mignardises: Finally, the dessert cart.  Unlimited amount of macarons..all the items on this cart was just delicious.  Our server knew how stuffed we were so he packed us two small boxes filled with delicious chocolate delights in them.

Before we left, they gave us a gift bag with the menu, rosemary bread, and a booklet of Joel Robuchon Restaurant, with Chef''s bio, menus, etc.

Joel Robuchon at MGM Grand has to be the #1 Restaurant on my list."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"After all those rave reviews on Sakana, I requested for hubby and I to have dinner here, on a Friday evening.

When we arrived, it wasn't busy whatsoever, so we sat on the other side, which was separated by plants etc.  However, it was 10 minutes before the male server realized that he had customers sitting on that side.  

He then took our drink order and though I was ready to place my order, he said he will be right back since another couple arrived.  Service was SLLLLOOOWWW.  It feels as if though they are short on servers.

When he finally came back to ask for our order, of course I order uni, amaebi, then he stop me and said, ""We ran out of uni and amaebi. Let me go check.""  Then he disappeared for a while.  When he came back, he handed us a sheet to order from and verified that they do not have uni and amaebi to order.

So I ordered items on the special menu (toro steak, salmon belly, white fish), saba, superwhite, salmon, scallops, salmon kama.  Server came back to let us know that they are out of salmon kama, how about Hamachi kama.  We said yeah that's cool.  He left and returned to let us know that they are also out of hamachi kama.

For the items that we did order, the only thing that tasted good was the salmon belly and toro steak.  Other items were doused with too much sesame oil, tasteless, or downright odd (the scallops tasted like they were previously cooked).

So at this point, I had given up on order anything else since I do not want to stuff myself with mediocre sushi.  Earl however, is eating for sustenance.  

We never, ever, order sushi rolls at AYCE.  But this night, Earl did.  He eat, just to eat.  We overheard another table said that they couldn't order chicken fried rice because they are out of it.  How they heck do you run out of chicken fried rice when your restaurant isn't even that busy?  We learned from another yelper that visited Sakana earlier that a health inspector came by earlier and service slowed down a lot.

Guess that explains some parts to the evening, but what about mediocre sushi?

Conclusion:  Goyemon is still the best.  We will not return to Sakana."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"So glad I decided to try out this filipino restaurant for lunch today!!!  The place was nice and clean.  Very spacious.  The food was in those buffet line looking warmer, and they have so many varieties.  The chairs were kinda uncomfortable though.  There was no cushion.  But after eating the food, I forgot about the non-cush for my tush.  

Pancit Palabok-The noodles were bigger than the ones I had before at Jollibee or Goldilocks.  It had a nice thick layer of pork rinds on top.  This adds texture and flavor to this awesome dish.  We asked for 6 wedges of lemon and squeeze them all on this dish, mix it around and wa la!!!  Pure DELICIOUSNESS!!!!  I must say this is the best pancit palabok I have eaten!

Lechon Kawali (Pan Roasted Pork)-roasted nicely with the right amount of crispiness to it.  Wasn't hard at all.  I usually get this at the chinese bbq restaurants, but this is a contender.  Wow, I am pleasantly surprise.  Love this.

Beef Caldereta (Filipino Beef Stew)-I recently decided to eat as little beef as possible, but I did try this.  The chunks of beef was tender, the stew was nice and comforting, with the yummy taste of different veggies that it was simmered in.  I somehow tasted a peanutty flavor, in which I was never a fan of peanuts.  However, this is still a nicely composed dish.  

Pork Adobo-So good!  I love tender pork.  What can I say?  Who doesn't right?  Full of flavor.  Yummy!

Dinuguan (Pork blood stew)-The color may look scary to some (ME!), but it's a savory stew of blood and meat simmered in a thick, spicy gravy of pig blood, garlic, chili and vinegar.  I am one to experiment with food so I tried it.  It's bursting with flavors!  

Halo Halo-This was yummy too!!!  It has the typical beans in the Halo Halo, the ice was easy to chew, and it has a scoop of halo halo ice cream on top.  It was missing the rice crispies though.  I found a small chunk of banana it it...which was a bit different then the ones I had at Goldilocks and Jollibee.  But I still enjoyed it.

The staff were very friendly and helpful.
Food was flavorful...Love Them!!!!!!  Yay, this is my favorite Philipino Food Place!!!

Oh, and the 2 items with rice is only for $5.49...So cheap and yummy!!!!"
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"6 of us came out here tonight, a Monday night for happy hour, and we were happy.  We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice night and because they only allowed happy hour specials at the bar/patio.  However, we would rather sit out there because it was just too dark in the dining area.

These are the tapas we ordered:
-Mac and cheese with the habenero:  We all liked this very much that we  doubled the initial quantity.  The habenero gave this tapa a lil kick and was a wonderful compliment.

-Beef empanadas-this was everyone's favorite.  Was light and fluffy with ground beef and other spices in the middle...yum

-Chicken empanada-not as good as the beef empanadas, but is aight.

-Spicy tuna ceviche-one of us doesn't eat sushi/sashimi, but she thought this was delicious.  I honestly thought it was a bit too fishy while everyone else liked it.

-Hamachi tiradito-the citrus brought out the flavor of this fish.  Was light and refreshing.  Was one of everyone's favorite.

-Cuban Sliders-ham on top of pork, was kinda boring to me.  I like cuban sandwiches when there is a dipping sauce.  This one doesn't come with a dipping sauce.

-Crispy Shrimp-one said that this reminds her of honey walnut shrimp, I didn't care too much for it.  The shrimps were tiny.

-Beef taco-Better than the fish, not as good as the chicken taco.  The portion seem to be tiny for the amount of pickled cabbage given.

-Chicken taco-Taste the best out of the three kinds of taco.  The pickled purple cabbage and a slice of jalapeno tasted very good with this chicken taco.

-Fish taco-least favorite...the fish was BORING.  Didn't taste like much.

-Churros-Everyone loved this desert.  It was so soft and fluffy, with a nice vanilla sauce (I think) drizzled on top of it.  Not a typical churro that one would get at El Pollo Loco, which I like too btw.

Sopapillas-Eh.  Whatevers.  A rectangular baked dough on a dish of honey and powdered sugar.  

Sugarcane sangria-This was GOOD.  Even for non-drinkers as myself.  Was very fruity with fruit pulp.  

Blackberry mojito-Was on the tart side.  No one liked this pitcher very much...

So, happy hour is definitely the time to go to try out many different tapas and drink the sugarcane sangria.  I will come back!"
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"After seeing that Long Jin offers Peking Duck, I bookmarked this restaurant to try.  We went there last night, which was Saturday, at 7ish, and were the only customers.  We were greeted by a friendly waitress.  The restaurant was very clean and modern.

I immediately noticed a paper sign noting that pot of tea is FREE!  Choices are oolong, jasmine, and long jin.  I chose the jasmine.  It was nice and fragrant.
I enjoyed looking through the menu but as I was there w/a purpose in mind, I quickly ordered peking duck and a plate of szechuan eggplants.

After our order was placed, the waitress brought out a small dish of crispy noodles w/a side of sweet and sour sauce.  It was a nice snack to munch  on.  Several minutes passed, the waitress ask if we would like to slurp on some soup, which was on the house since the peking duck takes some time.  The choices were the egg drop corn soup or the hot and sour soup.  We both decided on the hot and sour soup.  It came out piping hot and was quite delicious after I added black pepper to my bowl.

Finally, one of the personnel rolled out a cart when the nice peking duck slices and prepared 3 small plates with those lovely slices sandwiched between the nice moist bun, dressed with hoisin sauce and shreds of green onions.  Yum Yum Yum.  after 3 buns, I was happily satisfied.  Few moments later, a big plate of chopped duck pieces came out (the rest of the peking duck), and my eyes were wide, because that portion of duck will feed my bf and I for the next couple of days...yes, there were that many pieces.  Along with the the roasted duck was the plate of szechuan eggplants sauteed with woodear mushroom, bell pepper, bamboo shoots in a spicy garlic sauce, and a bowl of rice.

This was a great dinner experience, and I will definitely come come back with my bf's family to try out many more dishes, such as the tangerine beef, appetizer's platter, etc.

Customer Service was superb: 5 stars
Dinner (Peking duck and Eggplant): 5 stars
Restaurant itself: 5 stars (note:  the toilet paper is so strong and soft, the expensive kind)

I came to the conclusion that the reason why we were the only dine in customers there last night was 1.) due to the location and 2.) because they do deliveries."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"A day off on a Tuesday, which means I can FINALLY try Baguette Cafe...I have been looking forward to try this cafe for the longest time!!

When we arrived, Olivier took the time to explain to us the menu and answered any questions that we have.  He is one of the friendliest and most hospitable owner I have ever encountered.  Olivier and the staff provided exceptional service.

I went with a heavenly cup of cream of potato infused w prosciutto ham and truffle oil and a delectable 1/2 a brie chicken pannini.  My boyfriend had the hearty quiche, which came with a side of refreshing salad.  We went with the 24 oz green tea infused with citrus, in which we intended to share, but were pleasantly surprise that staff had divided the tea into two smaller cups, with lovely curly straw wrapper around the straw.  Ok, some of you might say ""who cares"" for the curly straw wrapper, but let me tell you...it was simple yet intricate, portrays how detailed, innovative and creative the team at Baguette Cafe is.  After seeing that creativity, sipping the tea was truly an ""aaahhhaaa"" moment.  My goodness it was so refreshingly yummy, even w/o sugar!

Knowing that I will be full on lunch, I asked for the chocolate torte to-go, and Olivier made sure that I am not to pick it up until I am ready to leave because it should be refrigerated until ready to be consumed.  Another instance to show how much Olivier care about his customer...food/dessert at the right temperature, right texture, so that they be at their best when eaten.  I was debating between the chocolate au pain crossaint and the chocolate torte, but right when Olivier said that the chocolate torte is the prefer choice for the chocolate connoisseur, I had to pick that dessert.   

My plan was to taste a bit of it when I get home and save it for later, but those bits added up and next thing you know, I devoured it along with the chocolate au pain crossaint (that's right, after seeing my big googly eyes staring down the crossaint and the torte, finally choosing the latter, Olivier surprised me with the crossaint).

I will be back to try many other items on the menu.  Awesome food, Awesome owner, Awesome staff =5 Stars!  Highly recommend!  

PS.  Hopefully Olivier will open Baguette Cafe on Saturday soon *fingers crossed*"
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"Finally...Earl and I got to try the three course lunch here at Milos.  Gosh, I have bookmarked this restaurant since the first review was posted on Yelp.  Since Earl and I will be volunteering to welcome our awesome veterans at The Cosmopolitan, it was just the perfect time to grab lunch prior.

I called to make a reservation yesterday and got it no problem.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we were greeted by three friendly hostesses.  One of the hostess walked us to the table that oversee the strip's view.  

The server that helped us was very knowledgeable and professional.  Service was impeccable.  Our glasses were never half empty...NEVER!  Once we are done with our plates, they were immediately taken away.  They served us grilled bread with a fragrant extra virgin olive oil.  I love bread so I attacked it, and crumbs were all on my side of the table.  Server joked that Earl must be eating the bread and dropped the crumbs on my side since his side was so clean...But anyways, he made sure that those crumbs are off the table.

Earl and I ordered the following:
-appetizer: fresh diver scallop on a skewer, and grilled octopus - fresh diver scallops (2) were cooked to perfection.  They were sweet and plump.  Grilled octopus, which cost $10 more, was Ah-Mazing!  So delicious that Earl asked if he can just have it again as an entree.  Wowee, it was done right!  Juicy, tender, and full of flavor.  It was so perfect with the capers and red onion.  Worth the extra $10.

-entree: Lavraki (Mediterranean bass) and Lamb Chops -the bass was sweet and simple.  It really showcase the fish.  The lamp chops cost $10 more but again, very worth it.  I am not a fan of lamb chops, but am a fan of Milos' lamb chops.  They were juicy and tender (we ordered medium-rare).  This was served with french fries and collard greens.  Even the french fries were cooked to perfection, and I am not a french fries eater.

-dessert:  we both got the walnut cake with the kaimaki icecream.  It was nice and moist and the icecream was refreshing.  We can't tell what the distinct flavor suppose to be for the kaimaki icecream.  I will google later.  Anyways, I wish I had ordered the yogurt, just to taste and see if I like it.

Earl also ordered Dogfish IPA for the app and entree, and an expresso for dessert.  Our total bill including tip was just shy of $100.  If you stick to just the basics for the three course lunch, it is $20.13.  

When Earl's brother is in town, Milos is where we will be for lunch."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"After four weeks postpartum, I just had to get back to UFC Anthem.  That's right, I have not gotten the medical clearance from my doc, but my body felt fine and I missed the gym way too much.  I was going crazy not going to the gym since I was 'gymming' until a few days prior to giving birth to my daughter.  The first day I went back to UFC Anthem, I felt alive again.
I have been going back since the 4th week postpartum to now, 8th week, and have been going 6 days a week.   There is a ring, speed bag, double sided bag, weights, machines, heavy bags, but what makes this gym so great, are the TRAINERS!

Trainers are ALL awesome, and I want to mention a few of them here in this post.

- Jake always make sure your guard is up, incorporates rows, slips, and walks around to ensure everyone is doing it correctly.  Class is non-stop because your rest time is active rest, where you are still moving side to side, doing something.  Love it.
- Denis takes the time to demonstrate how to throw punches, using our hips, etc.  Along with the proper technique, he instructs us to do calisthenics drills that are definitely fat blaster.  I enjoy those explosives routine.  The class may be tough but oh so much fun.  He also does mitts with us, when class permits.  Additionally, I must add that Denis' warm up session is crazy intense and I love every minute of it.
- Javon's classes are structured so that you get a full body workout.  I love it that we have warm up, then 8 rounds of 3 minute drills.  The drills include boxing, along with your upper body, lower body, cardio, everything!  We get rest, but they are all strategically given.  There are 2 of the 8 rounds that Javon incorporates tabata, a HIIT where we are going hard for 20 secs and rest for 10 secs, and repeat.  Towards the end of class, we would do abs, but tonight, we did interval sprints.  That was awesome.
- Ray's classes are never boring.  He changes it up and one class includes everything to help with cardio, strength and conditioning.  I always look forward for his DUT, FIT, well, any classes.
- Kyra's classes are awesome too.  She motivates and pushes everyone to give it our all. 

Rob, the Manager and Jay, the Assistant Manager are the nicest, friendliest, and awesome managers I have met to date.  They are very welcoming and takes the time to know us members.
This gym is more like a tight knit community where we all know each other/see the same group of folks with the same goal, to feel great and be as healthy as we can be, while enjoying a super workout that is fun and rewarding."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"Hot n juicy what? Crab corner who?  That's what u will be asking yourself after tasting Lola's crawfish. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned

So after we went zip lining at Freemont Street this afternoon, we were HONGRY...As we pass by a sign indicating that Lola's have Louisiana Style boiled crawfish, Friday and Saturday, I quickly yelped Lola's. Called and learned that 200lbs of live crawfish is flown in to be boiled for perfection. Sounds good to us so we made a U-turn.  

When we walked into this little restaurant, we immediately feel as if though we were somewhere in Louisiana.  The decor was mardi gras-ish.  We looked at the menu and saw that 5lbs of crawfish, w/potato and corn for $41.99.  That sounds pretty awesome but we played it safe and ordered 1lb to see if it meets our expectation prior to going for the big bang.  After 5 mins or so, our 1lb of crawfish along with a corn on the cob and a cute little potato came out.  We each grabbed a crawfish...it smelled right...snap off the tail and peeled off the shell, took a bite and WOW.  The meat was tender and juicy, was seasoned perfectly.  They were not drenched in oil and/or butter like the competition.  No need for any condiment.  Lola made it right.  We then quickly flagged our waiter down and politely asked if we may take advantage of the 5lbs deal by adding another 4lbs to the order.  He asked Lola and she was so awesome to allow it.  10 mins later, Lola brought out the 4lbs of crawfish to us herself.  She is such a wonderful and funny lady owner.  And, best of all, she knows how to make delicious crawfish.  

We also ordered a dozen wings with fries.  We liked them naked fried so we asked the waiter beforehand if they were battered fried or naked fried.  He responded that they are naked fried.  WRONG!  They came out battered fried.  BOOOOOO.  But the flavor was there so we let it go.  We learned that our waiter has only been there for 2 weeks so it's ok.  The crawfish was so tasty that it didn't matter.

To end this wonderful lunch at Lola's, we   ordered the bread pudding.  It was warm and moist, with a hint of Mr. Jim Bean secret concoction.  YUM.

It has been hard for us to find a place that makes crawfish like how we remembered it to be in the South.  All the other items on the menu looks delicious, but we can't find ourselves ordering anything other than crawfish!  As soon as crawfish season is over, we will delve into the other menu items, like the red bean and rice, jambalaya, and so many more...

If you love crawfish, this place is a must. You will not be disappointed."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"Finally we tried out Sage tonight for my bf's birthday.  The signature tasting menu has upped from $79 to $89 and wine/beer pairing has upped from $39 to $44.  Here are the items we got:

Amuse Buche: Smoked salmon profiterole.  One bite that excited our palate.  Then we got to choose the bacon bread or the sourdough bread to spread some chive butter and sprinkle some Himalayan sea salt on it if we like.  I prefer the sourdough. 

1st Course:
-Wagyu Beef Tartare -Delicious.  The beef was tender and yummy with the nice crushed caper aioli to give it that oomph and the slow poached egg to bring everything together.  We were given crostini to top the tartare on.  This was paired with a Chimay white.
-Foie Gras Brulee (extra $10)-like a savory dessert.  Too rich for my taste.  I only ate a quarter and was done with this.

Winner: Wagyu Beef Tartar

2nd Course:
-Grilled Spanish Octopus: The octopus pieces were so tender...never had it this tender ever!  These octopus slices were served with smoked Potato Puree, fried potatoes, and other veggies.  This was paired with a Unibroe.
-Maine Dayboat Scallops:  2 jumbo scallops and they were cooked to perfection.  American Fish can learn from Sage how to cook seafood.  They were served with braised oxtail and wild mushrooms.  The scallops were the star and I could care less about the oxtail and mushrooms.

Winner:  Both were delicious, but scallops win by a few points.

3rd Course:
-Iberco Pork Loin: the pork loin was a bit salty, the ham was not memorable, the crispy pork shoulder was delicious.  This was paired with a dark beer that my bf cannot remember the name of but he loved this beer.  
-48 hour beef belly:  Very tender.  It was served with grilled peach.  This was paired with a Chimay Red.

Winner: 48 hour beef belly, although the crispy pork shoulder in the Iberco Pork Loin was pretty darn good!

4th Course:
-Gianduja Pave: This is an olive oil ice cream with pieces of hazelnut crunch and basil jam.  It was quite beautiful  but a  bit hard to eat since we have to spoon a bit of the ice cream, the blue berries, the hazelnut crunch, the chocolate, to get them all in one bite.  My bf didn't like this dessert as much as I did.
-Pistachio Tart:  The tart was in little pieces, strategically laid out on top of some stringy cake, served with sauteed strawberries and a strawberry-black pepper gelato.  Interesting flavor combination.  It also came with a lit candle for my bf.  My bf loved this dessert.  This was paired with a fruity lindemann beer.

Winner:  Tied.

We ended the night with this white chocolate drink, compliments of the chef.  Was yummy in my tummy.  The total bill, including tip, was $300.

Worth it?  Yes.  Service was impeccable."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"Dinner reservation was set for 6:30pm on a Monday evening.  The host told us that they will hold the table up to 10 mins after 6:30 and if we don't get there by 6:40pm, they will give our table away.  We rushed over to the Signature to check-in and put the luggage away and we heard the phone rang and was told that if we don't get to the restaurant by 6:40pm, they will so give out table away.  We power walked from Tower 3 (the farthest tower from the walkway) to get to Shibuya.  I was wearing a 3 inch heel boots, but we really wanna make it to dinner.

So when we arrived, it wasn't even busy!!!!  Who were they going to give the table to...no one?  Anywho, we secured our table while waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.

The drinks were quite expensive.  A bottle of Asahi was like $8 and a cocktail drink was $14.  That's the price at the freakin club man. Their selected entrees comes with a salad with apple yuzu vinaigrette, choice of lobster or mushroom miso soup, vegetables, rice, and a dessert trio.  the salad was fresh and crisp, and the vinaigrette was very refreshing.  I chose the mushroom miso soup, and there were 3 different types of mushroom.  Was light and comforting.  

Most of us got the Surf and Turf, which includes the 1/2 Australian Lobster Tail, 4 oz Tenderloin, and 3 Tiger Prawns.  The lobster tails were overcooked, the tenderloins were medium-rare and cooked perfectly, the prawns were overcooked as well.  Our party really enjoyed the three different sauces that were provided.  I like the garlic butter so I requested extra extra garlic butter on the side so I can dip the different protein into...I know, ""heart attack"" is bound to happen but I don't splurge like this all the time, and my cholesterol has been checked recently and I am normal.

The fried rice was next, after everyone pretty much finished our protein.  It was decent, but I must agree with fellow yelpers that I prefer Benihana's fried rice.  Just more flavor I believe.
At this point, we were so full, that we totally forgot about the veggies.  But that didn't stop the chef from pulling out a tray of asparagus, oyster mushroom, and another green veggie that I can't remember the name at this time.  He plated it nicely on a squared glass plate and handed to each of us.  A couple of us weren't a fan of this plate of veggie, and would rather prefer the Benihana veggies...

Our Pastry Chef's Dessert Trio consisted of a vanilla mochi icecream, lychee inside chocolate something, and a raspberry gelee combined with something???  Well regardless, the raspberry dessert was everyone's favorite, which the lychee chocolate wasn't so yummy, and the mochi was kinda hard for some...

Anyways, the chef was funny and friendly, restaurant is nice and clean, has quality ingredients, but I think the price is high."
5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,"That is...As good as it gets...in Las Vegas!!!!

I have been coming here since I found it in its prior name, Himalayan Restaurant.  The first time I came here, we used the coupon from Restaurant.com.  I had a hard time finding a good Indo-Pak Restaurant, so good thing there is Restaurant.com.

First Time
Appetizer
Himalayan Samosas-Potatoes and peas, stuffed in a light fluffy pastry.  BUT...the best thing about this is dipping it into the tamarind chutney.  Dang this is awesome.

Chicken Rebel Curry-Spicy...not much else.  I haven't been ordering this.  Not memorable.  let's move on.

Lamb Vindaloo-Spicy and tons of flavor.  The lamb was nice and tender.

Garlic Naan-were not short of Garlic.  Top that lamb vindaloo pieces with a shred of onion and dip it into the tamarind chutney...WOW!!

Mango Lassi-Is good as ever.
My friend said that coupon or no coupon, we are coming back Fo SHO!!

Second time
Didn't use a coupon so we were able to get:
-Indian Sampler-30.99
--garlic naan
--pakodas-dumpling kinda look, with vegetable stuffed inside.  the outside is a chickpea batter.  This was dipped into a nutty sauce..interesting combination
--chicken tikka marsala
--lamb vindaloo
--tandoori chicken-chicken was very juicy with a nice spice rub.  
--vegetable curry-for a vegetable curry, this is so flavorful
--yogurt (this was homemade, it was super tart..too tart for my taste)
--basmati rice (I am used to the jasmine rice, but this basmati is on a new playing field)
--Khir-dessert is this rice pudding (basmati rice! yay), in milk, spiced, with nuts and raisins.  This is one of my favorite dessert.  Once again, bursting with flavors.

This sampler was perfect.  We got to tried out everything.  Recommend for adventurous newbies.  They weren't super spicy either so is easy on the tongue (and tummy) since there are so may other dish that one can alternate between the spicy one...lamb vindaloo.

Third time and so on:
Ghosht Karahi (Goat Curry)-Flavors remind me of back home...aahhhh, I miss home....Ok, focus!  So, my routine comes to play.  I ask for a side of onion and some lemon wedges.  I mix the onion with the goat curry, and squeeze lemon in it.  It's amazing how the onion would make the flavor even spicier, and how the lemon juice brings out that tang!!!  Now try this with the best naan that I have tasted yet...the naan with fruits in the middle.  This is the only place that have it, as far as I know.  You get savory and sweet.  Have mango lassi with this entree is the PERFECT combination.  Of course I have the Khir at the end of my every meal.  

Service has always been super for me.  The owners are sooooooo Fantastic.  They are so kind and wonderful.  I love the decor.  Oh, I forgot to mention, they have a very extensive beer selection.  My friends always order beer and try like three different kinds every time.  I stick to my mango lassi and am happy with it."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"Totally solid brunch spot. I am always on the lookout for great weekend brunch places (that either take resos or do not have crazy line ups) and will now add L'Ouvrier to the list. Came here on a saturday at 11:30 and it was busy but we were able to get a table for 4 no problem. 

The menu is not your typical standard eggs benny etc., although they do have a classic breakfast with eggs/sausage if that's what you want. But there are some interesting options like half a dozen New Brunswick oysters, tuna tartare (I believe this doubles as an appetizer on their dinner menu), or my choice - potato rosti covered in a large arugula salad with smoked salmon. Portions are on the smaller side, and prices are on the higher side, so I would delegate this place to a place to treat yourself or take out of town guests rather than a regular hangout. Food itself was very fresh and presented nicely. The oysters came with 3 different sauces made in house that looked delicious! Since portions were small, we also shared their fresh baked lemon citrus scones with creme fraiche and homemade peach jam. Total comfort food and the jam had big chunks of real peaches. One DC also had the cookies and cream panna cotta - quite tasty too!! (The other dessert options were a flourless chocolate cake or key lime pie, in case you were wondering). For drinks, they have french press coffee, nice espresso drinks, and Mighty Leaf teas. 

Aside from the good food, the reason I give this place 4 stars in because of the lovely ambiance and excellent service. L'Ouvrnier means the workman (taken from a line in George Orwell's ""Down and Out in Paris and London"") and the large black and white photo of chefs at the back dominates the minimalist white room - it's cool yet unpretentious. It's bright and sunny for brunch and I'd imagine it'd also be a cool spot for drinks at night with the big square bar at the back of the room. The decor looks like something out of a design magazine and is complemented by mismatched china coffee cups and saucers, with hot pink accents here and there. The space is spacious enough so you aren't inadvertently eavesdropping on your neighbours (compared to nearby Bent or spots like Terroni). Our server was exceptionally thoughtful and sincere - something truly refreshing in the Toronto dining scene. We never felt rushed and were able to linger as long as we wanted. 

I am interested in seeing what it's like for dinner. According to the website, they have a 6 course tasting menu for $50 per person."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"I waited for the hype to die down before visiting this outlet mall (that despite it's name, is not in Toronto)!! I heard it was super-crowded when it opened last summer, but on a winter weekend, it was easy to find parking and there were no line-ups outside of stores. I had read reviews on Yelp, so perhaps my expectations were tempered. I dressed warmly since it's an outdoor mall, and ate beforehand since the ""food court"" is pretty minimal. 

I found that the selection and prices were pretty good. Maybe the markdowns weren't as huge as you might find in bigger American outlets, but I still found some great stuff (and had to use self control to not buy more...). Shops I visited:
- Kate Spade - 1st stop as this was one of the main reasons for coming here. Entire store was 40% off, plus some stuff an additional 20% after that (you need a calculator!!). The store is pretty big with a good selection of bags, jewellery, glasses, and clothing. 
- The Bay - some of the deepest discounts in the mall were here. Crazy prices on designer stuff from The Room, including beautiful Zac Posen dresses. However, the sizes available were limited. They have an organized system with coloured stickers and each colour is associated with an extra 20-50% off the last marked price. Good selection of shoes and accessories. 
- Coach - the most crowded store when I came, which made the shopping experience less pleasant. Lots of bags and mens stuff as well. 
- Burberry - well, Burberry is too expensive for me even with a big discount, but it's fun to browse. They had a bunch of their classic trench coats for ""only"" $1200!! Some really nice bags too. 
- Ted Baker - love this store for dresses!! However, I found the markdowns were not the greatest. 
- Cole Haan - very good prices on classic items like pumps, loafers, boots. I saw a lot of shoes over 50% off. 
- Lacoste - meh. They had all sweaters and dresses for $40 but the classic polos were still $70. 
- J. Crew - it's a Factory Store, so it's not the same stuff from their regular store. That said, the styles were often very similar. The sale prices are not much lower than the regular store, but when I went, everything was on some kind of promotion with an additional 20-40% off (signage was not always clear, so you have to ask). The store was well laid-out and it was easy to find stuff. 

Overall, I think this is a pretty decent outlet mall. I don't know if I would go really out of my way to come back, but it's right off the 401, and I could see myself stopping by en route to London/Guelph/Stratford etc."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"I took class here twice on a short weekend visit to Montreal. I like to try different yoga studios while traveling and sometimes it can be a little intimidating (clique-y, snobbish, no explanations given). Ashtanga Yoga Montreal is the opposite of all that. I was relieved the minute I walked in the door and was warmly greeted by the teacher, Allison, who I later found out is one of the studio directors. 

The space - it's on the 2nd floor in an office building, above a cafe. There are 3 studios, all non-heated. I know hot yoga is all the rage these days, but for those of us who like their yoga room temperature, this place is great. There is a large reception area with room for shoes and coats. The change rooms themselves are very small. There is mat storage available for regulars. You bring your valuables into the studio since there are no lockers. The washrooms are shared and just across the hall. The studio overlooks Rue St. Catherine and have plenty of props and blankets available. The general atmosphere is home-y and cozy, rather than some studios that are going for a more spa-like or modern/minimalist aesthetic. Yoga mats are available for rent and the mat rental is free for your first class (which is $10) or for lunch time classes. 

I took a multilevel class with Alison and a level 1-2 class with Tania. Both were led classes, but if you prefer mysore style, they offer that too. Both teachers I had were good. So many studios offer ashtanga-influenced ""flow"" or ""vinyasa"" classes, but I appreciated that these classes were tied closely to the traditional ashtanga style (moving through postures from the primary series mostly). Alison was exception and really went above and beyond when it came to hands on adjustments and useful alignment tips. She also made a point to orient me at the beginning and ask me how the class felt afterwards. A lot of studios seem to ignore you until you become a regular, so it was nice to feel immediately welcome. The multilevel class gave lots of options for beginnings and more advanced practitioners alike. The makeup of the class was diverse -- not just the skinny, bendy, lululemon-clad, Caucasian female stereotype of yoga (nothing wrong with them, of course, but it can add to the intimidation factor for some when everyone is like that!). 

Prices are really reasonable and there are student discounts. They also offer different workshops, including acro yoga. Both classes I attended were led in English (with a little French sprinkled in). 

This is a great, no frills place to practice ashtanga yoga. I would recommend it to anyone!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"I have been here twice now and both times were just wonderful. I was tempted to try Bota Bota, which looks stunning in the photos, but reading reviews from Yelp/Trip Advisor it seems like Scandinave is the place to go for a more relaxing and quiet atmosphere, plus better customer service. Can't vouch for Bota Bota, but definitely echo all the great reviews about this place. It makes it hard to want to try any other spa in the area. 

So, customer service -- top notch. The bilingual staff here are polite, friendly, and make sure everything is taken care of. I made reservations on the phone and they provided lots of information about the spa. Checking in was smooth. They greeted me and my SC (spa companion:P) by name and they do a thorough job orienting you to the space. I had a massage with Yan which was maybe the best massage I have ever had! Very attentive, actually looked at that medical history sheet (I notice at some spas they get you to fill it out and then no one bothers to look at it!), and used some passive stretches in addition to more traditional Swedish massage techniques. There were lots of staff making sure to keep everything clean. 

The facility is beautiful. I can't compare to other Spa Scandinaves which have an outdoor component, but I really like the quiet and dark-ish ambiance here. It feels like you're in a cocoon. I love both the steam room (which smells amazing, is really spacious, and really allows for a gradient in heat depending on which level you sit on) and the dry sauna (wooden head rests? yes please!). The lounge area has everything you need from comfy lounge chairs (like giant bean bag chairs), pillows, magazines, apples, dried fruit, nuts, water, mint tea... The quiet zone is a great place to take a nap. The women's change room has 3 showers plus hair dryers, flat irons, body and face cream, hair elastics, spray deodorant, and other essentials in case you didn't bring your own. There is a supply of plastic bags for you to store your wet swimsuit when you leave. The robes are super plush and fuzzy. Your locker is opened/closed with a thin waterproof bracelet, so you don't need to worry about carrying a key around. 

Prices are very reasonable for the quality of the spa and services. Check out the Sunday night/weekday specials. I went on a Monday and got a 60 mins. massage plus access to the baths for $99. They also post some promotions on their website or facebook. I wish we had a place like this in Toronto (maybe the closest one is Hammam Spa)! This is everything a spa should be -- just show up, bring your bathing suit, and let them take care of the rest!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"(3.5 stars)

I came here for Summerlicious in a group of 6 for a girls night. They gave us the long communal table with high chairs by the bar. The place is dark and lounge-y. The flatscreen TV plays classic Italian movies. On this evening, it was ""La Dolce Vita"" (also, ask your server if you want a 2 for 1 voucher for admission to the Fellini: Spectacular Obsessions exhibit at the TIFF Bell Lightbox). Music ranged from instrumental jazz to Motown classics. 

Food was great and I liked that they had a good selection for Summerlicious (4 appetizers/4 mains/3 desserts to choose from). I find some other restaurants only offer 2 or 3 choices during Summerlicious. We had to ask the server a lot of questions because for almost every item on the menu there was a word we didn't know (and I eat a lot of Italian food!). I had the baccala (that's just Italian for salt cod) montecato served with fried polenta and spinach. The cod was almost pureed and rolled into a ball, then fried. It was tasty and not too fishy. The polenta was a bit too crunchy for my liking. A smooth polenta would've made for a better combination. But the spinach was nice and garlic-y. For the main course, I had the sweet pea trophie. Trophie is a short, twisted pasta similar to fussili but skinnier. The pasta here is homemade and had a really great texture to it. It was served in a basil pesto with peas, ricotta cheese and mint -- a light, summery dish! Last but not least, a decent espresso panna cotta. 

I also tried some of my friends' dishes. The heirloom tomato panzanella with 2 kinds of basil was a favourite. It's sort of like a bread pudding with tomatoes... that sounds weird. It had pieces of bread that were crispy but not hard like croutons. The spagetti with clams was yummy too. The pasta portions were not very big, which was perfect since we were having 3 courses. But they listed the individual prices, and the pasta dishes are $22-24 which seemed like a lot for such small dishes. I don't know if the portions would be bigger if you weren't ordering from the Summerlicious menu?

Drinks were good and our server was also the bartender, so he had lots of good suggestions (although service was understandably slow since he was busy making cocktails between serving tables! I feel like they should hire a separate person). I had the strawberry fields cocktail (grey goose, strawberry puree, basil) which was sweet, but not too sweet. We later shared a bottle of Italian white wine (most of their wines are Italian). 

The meal ($35 prix fixe) + drinks, taxes, and tip came out to around $75 per person. So it is still on the pricier end, but definitely a nice treat."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"Came here in a party of 5 for Father's Day dinner! I made a reservation on OpenTable, natch. 

FOOD: 
They had a $35 three course prix fixe for Father's Day, which was a pretty good deal, although you could only choose your appetizer (soup or salad). There was no choice for the main (prime rib) or dessert (brownie with some kind of crystalized syrup thing with *bacon*?!). My Dad went for it and really enjoyed it. The salad came in a very generous portion served on a huge plate. The bacon dessert thing was a mystery. It said bacon on the menu but I tried a bite of the brownie and didn't taste any bacon... so we assumed it was in the crystally thing. I guess we'll never know. 

As for the rest of us... sibling found a fruit fly floating in the broth that the oysters came in. Kinda gross... but understandable. I mean, drosophila are everywhere this season and they breed like mad. The server looked appalled when she pointed it out, and abruptly took the bowl and ran to the kitchen without saying a word (interesting response). He came back and apologized, said he had told the manager, and that they would give us a free glass of wine. 

I quite enjoyed the crispy ewenity curds... Basically huge chunks of cheese deep fried in a tempura-like batter. The cheese was all gooey and soft inside and the batter was crispy and delicious (although oily... I would recommend getting this to share and distributing the high fat content that way). 

I had the baked spring vegetable tart. I wasn't feeling particularly meat-y and the menu is pretty meat-heavy. But the tart was nice and flaky with goat cheese, eggplant, peppers and zucchini. The menu said asparagus, but there was no asparagus to be found (I looked hard). It came with a nice side salad. 

For dessert, I had the panna cotta. The smoked vanilla flavour was nice, but otherwise I've had better. The portion was actually bigger than I expected. 

I would recommend trying one of their cocktails, they all sounded so yummy! I had the ''sweet thyme'' which has ice wine in it. Perhaps it's a bit too syrupy sweet for some, but I loved it. 

SERVICE: 
Service was fine. Nothing special but they checked up on us frequently enough. The maitre d' looked really bored. I felt bad for her. 

SPACE:
The dining room is modern and glam, with cool light fixtures and clean lines. There are 2 patios - one out front facing Yonge and another on the side of the restaurant. There is also a private dining room at the back near the washrooms that looks very nice. 

Nice ambiance, tasty local food, and reasonable prices (especially when they have a prix fixe). This is a good place for a special occasion and got the stamp of approval from my Dad."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"I like this place! I have visited for weekend brunch and also for dinner.

BRUNCH
I came on a Sunday ~11:30 and only waited about 10 minutes for a table for two. The place was hoppin' and Salt'n'Pepa was blaring on the stereo. They have lots of juices beyond your regular apple and orange, and they come in S/M/L. I had a pineapple juice, yum! So many things on the menu sounded tempting (frittata... breakfast poutine...) but I decided to be health-conscious and go for the 'Healthy Scramble'. It's an egg white scrambled with creamy goat cheese loaded with fresh vegetables (asparagus, roasted red peppers, sundried tomatoes, shallots). Deelish! It came with toast and fresh fruit. Service was a little off in terms of timing, but our server was really friendly. 

DINNER
Came back for dinner with a Groupon. My DC and I had dinner on the patio, which was really nice. The patio is non-smoking. I really like this, because I like to sit outside when the weather's nice, but sitting next to a table where everyone is smoking kinda makes me lose my appetite. Actually, there was a couple in the next table and at one point the guy really wanted to have a smoke. So he had to walk around and stand on the sidewalk (outside the fence) to have his cigarette. 
Anyways, I arrived before my DC and ordered a rasberry mojito, which was refreshing. Maybe there could have been a little more fresh mint, but all in all, a decent mojito. The drinks menu in general is pretty extensive with lots of interesting sounding fruity cocktails, martinis, wine, and sangria. 
They have a daily soup special and on this evening, they had 2 burger specials -- a turkey burger and a veggie burger. My DC had the turkey burger and it looked fantastic. I had the Eastside Chopped Salad, which was solid but not too exciting. Just romaine, ham, chick peas, cheese, and corn in a vinaigrette. I also got a side order of  the cajun mac and cheese, which was great! The spiciness added a nice kick and the portion was actually pretty big. Some of the prices seem weird to me. It costs $5 extra if you want to add tofu to your salad, yet a nice dish of mac and cheese on the side is only $6? They didn't bring us any bread while we were waiting, but that's probably a good thing because we were both really full. 
Our server was very laid-back and cool, although slow to bring us the bill. We had no problems using the Groupon and even though many places do not let you include alcohol (the Groupon said it was just for food), he included our mojitos as part of the discount. 

In summary, FOES is a standout place for brunch and a pretty good dinner spot too. This place is friendly, easy-going, and reliable. 

P.S. They share washrooms with FLY nightclub next door."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"I came on a Friday night in a party of 4. I almost gave up on this place... Almost a week in advance, I phoned to make a reservation. No one answered, so I left a message. 2 days pass, no call. So I decide to try calling them again. I call at strategic times to try and catch them before they get too busy. No dice. At one point, the call answer thing tells me their voice mailbox if full. Bad sign... Finally though, they did get back to me. FYI - I think on Friday/weekends they only do 2 sittings, 6pm and 8:30pm. 

Showed up and the people at our table were still not done... It wasn't that bad, but we did have to wait 10 mins. which is sort of annoying when we already had a reservation. 

But I still give Campagnolo 4 stars because the food was SO good. I had high expectations and I was worried it might not live up to them, but thankfully I wasn't disappointed! 

I had:
- Cocktail that was basically a gin & tonic with fresh mint and cucumbers. Simple perfection. Nice and refreshing. 

- Brussel sprouts with pancetta and pine nuts -- love at first bite! The creamy sauce was divine. Luckily we got the house made baguette, so I could dip the bread in it. Good portion size. 
- Had a bite of the burrata and grapes. So fresh and tasty. I am definitely going to order this next time. 
- One person got the prosciutto which was nice but it didn't come with any bread or anything. The prosciutto looked a bit lonesome on that long plate... Another ordered the fish chowder. Looked hearty and he said it was really, really good (so good he wouldn't share!). 

- Spaghetti all' Amatriciana - I was so excited to try this because it is a quintessential Roman dish that I discovered recently while traveling in Rome. Campangolo's version was just as good as the ones I tried in Italy. Perfect al dente noodles and the sauce was spicy but not exaggerated. 
- We didn't really share entrees, but the person who ordered the boar was raving about it. And another friend got over his psychological barriers to eating rabbit (bunny!) -- and enjoyed the pappardelle dish. 

- Peppercorn panna cotta - interesting idea and mix of flavours, although after a few bites I found it way too pepper-y. 
- Salted caramel budino - I'll echo what everyone else has said, one of the highlights of the meal. 

Despite my frustrations in booking a table here (why have a phone if you don't pick it up?!?), Campagnolo has won me over. Really authentic Italian food done right -- simple dishes that let fresh ingredients speak for themselves and a small but always changing menu (luckily favourites like the burrata and the caramel budino are almost always on offer though). Knowledgeable and friendly staff plus a warm, inviting space are the cherry on top."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"I have visited this spa, previously called Shizen Spa, just over a year ago and was quite happy with the service. My old review is here: https://www.yelp.ca/biz/shizen-spa-toronto-2. I was impressed with the quality of the massage I had that time and the customer service was good too. I also really liked the steam room and sauna. So, when I saw a Groupon for this spa for a massage/mani/pedi, I went for it. I am usually wary of spa with Groupons unless it is a business I'm already familiar with. So I was very disappointed that the spa, now The Village Spa, has really declined in service and the facilities. 

The trouble started with booking an appointment. I called to book well in advance, as I know Groupons can sometimes make spas really busy and availability can be limited. I phoned, left a message. No answer for days. I emailed, nothing. I sent a message using their website form. Someone kindly phoned me back several days later and left me a message, apologizing for the delay, and saying there was availability for the day/time I requested. I called back, but the person who had called me was not there that day. The woman on the phone said ""okay, we can't make your appointment right now. We will call you back."" She hung up on me before I could ask a question. After the endless phone tag, I finally made an appointment but subsequent staff never apologized. I even provided them written feedback expressing my disappointment and frustration, and was never contacted to even acknowledge that...

As for the spa experience itself, I enjoy their ""rainforest zone"" but the steam room was not hot when I went there. I had to get it going which took a few minutes. It smelt kind of unpleasant too. More like a sweaty changeroom than a rainforest. My massage was decent, hence the 2 stars. Then I was sent to a waiting area for the mani/pedi. I waited 45 mins. with no one checking up on me. I finally went to the desk to inquire. No apology, they just said ""uhhh hold on"". And a few minutes later, a flustered aesthetician arrived and simply said to me ""there was a screw up"". Great. They didn't have the best selection of nail colours and the whole salon area looked kind of old and worn. I found myself wishing I had just gone to my usual cheap Asian nail salon on Yonge St. instead. While doing my nails, the aesthetician told me how she was working 12 hours straight with no lunch break. While awkward to have staff complain to clients, if this is truly the case and that is how employees are treated, I don't want to support their business.

I won't be back when there are so many better spas downtown. I think the management has changed and it's unfortunate, because this is nowhere near the standard of a nice hotel spa."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"Barre3 has arrived in the east end! This popular barre method, originally from Portland, has gained a huge following across the US and the first Toronto location opened a few years ago on King Street West. 

This brand new location in Leslieville is pretty similar to the west end location -- same great workout, beautiful space, and the same excellent roster of instructors. 

Overall, this location is a bit larger and more spacious. There's a separate unisex change room and a bigger women's change room with 1 shower. Amenities like towels, razors, qtips etc. are provided. The lockers are an improvement from the original location, as they have a 4 number lock code, so you don't have to carry around the little key. There's a cozy area to hang out if you're early, as well as a small boutique area selling workout wear, water bottles, toe socks etc. 

Another major difference is that this location has a kids play lounge and certain classes on the schedule will have supervision for little ones. The glass windows of the studio even mean that if you pick a strategic spot in class, you could keep an eye on your kid while you work out. 

But all that wouldn't really matter, unless the actual workout was great, and it is! Barre3 is one of my favourites in the city because it's really for everyone because of the many modifications offered. I like that I can go if I'm feeling tired and just want to move a little, or if I really want to go hard and sweat. You're encouraged to listen to your body. Pre/post-natal, recovering from an injury -- you could still do a class here. It's a welcoming, supportive environment, pretty much the opposite of ""boot camp"" type places where you'd be shamed for dialing things down. But don't be mistaken, if you want to push yourself hard, you definitely can! (they've added 4 lbs. weights... I know that doesn't sound like a lot, but it IS when most upper body moves involve straight arms extended away from the body!). This is especially your workout if you want to really target all the different muscle groups in the core, legs and glutes. I would say it is more pilates/yoga inspired than classical ballet-based, so don't be intimidated if you're not much of a dancer.  

The class I took here during the opening week with Sara was fantastic. She had the perfect playlist to get us through those high rep sequences and walked around paying attention to everyone's form to make sure we got the most out of our hour. The studio owner, Aimee, is approachable, friendly and warm. It's obvious that every little detail is thought of here, with attention on creating a community and helping students lead a healthy lifestyle. I have a feeling this place is going to become really popular in this 'hood!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"I came here for dinner on a weeknight. They open at 5pm, but my friend and I arrived just before 5 and they hadn't quite opened yet. The hostess was really nice and let us sit at the bar and look at the menu while we waited for our table. You can also order food and sit at the bar/lounge area, but we decided to sit in the dining room -- which is beautiful, by the way. 

Right now, they have some Tim Burton inspired additions to the menu -- ""Creature Comforts"". There was a 2 course prix fixe ($25 for soup or salad + entree). My friend has the soup of the day (Lobster bisque) and the ""Big Fish"" aka seared tuna on a bed of vegetables and chickpeas. I went for the roasted cod from the regular menu, which was amazing. Perfect texture, served over wild mushrooms (with some kind of mushroom foam -- first time I've had a main course with foam... it was actually so tasty and an interesting mix of textures), sweetbreads, celery and porcini cream. There were also some pieces of chicken -- I thought it was weird that they didn't mention that in the menu description, but anyways, it was tasty. For dessert, I just had to get the ""Willy Wonka"" -- dark valrhona chocolate delice with a small piece of caramelized banana, a dollop of peanut butter ice cream, and cocoa nib crisp. Bonus points for stunning presentation (gah! I didn't bring my camera!). 

We both tried cocktails from the Tim Burton menu. I had the Alice in Wonderland inspired ""Drink Me"" -- wiser's and ginger-pear juice. Yum! My friend had the ""Sweetie Todd"" - absolut rasberri, white cranberry juice, lemon, and bits of crushed raspberries. 

So, the food offerings were excellent and went beyond expectations, but this place gets 5 stars because the service was also impeccable. Our server was really professional yet warm and personable, and very attentive without being intrusive. She gave suggestions without seeming pushy, and never hurried us, even though it took us a really long time to decide what to order. She also had all the specials memorized and recited them like poetry. When she set our dishes on the table, she stated/pointed out what the different components were (okay, not always necessary... uhh yeah I can SEE that is the ice cream). It's really an atmosphere where the servers seem to actually care about the food and your enjoyment of it. 

The space is perfect for an intimate dinner, special occasion, or a date. Not too noisy (actually, come to think of it, I can't even remember if they were playing music at all?), not too bright nor too dark, tables spaced out enough, elegant, simple decor, and floor to ceiling windows with a nice view of King St. W. 

Oh and the far bathroom (there are 3 gender-neutral private bathrooms) is bigger than some downtown bachelor apartments. 

Highly recommended!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"This place is made for picture-perfect girlfriends' gatherings. It doesn't seem like a place to come for regular mani-pedis, it's more of a special treat type of place. 

I had read some of the negative reviews here and was a bit wary when my friend suggested a get together here. However, we were 5 women celebrating 2 birthdays, so it did seem like we fit in to their target demographic. 

Overall, we ended up having a great time! Yes, it is pricier than your usual nail salon. Just know you are paying for the ambiance and the type of place you can linger and hang out. (I also hope that the higher price point means that they are paying their employees fairly, as much has been written about the real costs and problems behind the super-cheap nail salons: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/nyregion/at-nail-salons-in-nyc-manicurists-are-underpaid-and-unprotected.html). 

We had a reservation we made weeks in advance (for a Saturday afternoon). They are very strict about everything, needing a credit card to hold the reservation, full names of all guests, and you cannot be more than 5 mins. late! Do keep this in mind. I'm not sure how smooth this process was, as it was my friend who did the booking. 

We were welcomed in, they took our heavy winter coats (and my friend's luggage as she was going to the airport after) and we were invited to peruse their nail polish colours and drinks menus. They have an excellent selection of colours and brands, organized by colour family. I really enjoyed this as it made it really easy to compare similar colours. 

I had the ""mermaid latte"" which was not too sweet and was very unique. I actually don't remember what was in it except that it was tasty! They have a wide variety of drinks, both alcoholic/non-alcoholic. They also offer some simple snacks like cookies and macarons. 

I had the signature mani ($40) done by Jay, who was really sweet. It's just a regular mani, nothing too special. 

I think the management have read some of the negative reviews about customer service, because a woman (I think she was the manager?) checked in with our group multiple times to make sure everything was okay. She even read the menu out loud for my friend who was in the middle of getting her polish applied. 

They timed everything pretty well so we finished around the same time and then could sit at the little tables and chat while waiting for our nails to dry (rather than at the nail bar, where it is a long table and hard to have a conversation with anyone other than the person beside you). We hung out there for a long while even after our nails were dry and never felt rushed to leave. 

I thought it was a bit weird you have to pay for your nail service and drinks separately, but no biggie. 

Would certainly recommend this place for a fun, girly get together!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"Came to Momofuku in a party of 7 with plans to go to the noodle bar. At 5:30pm there was already a line forming, but the host told us Daisho just opened on the 3rd floor, sweet! We went there instead and were not disappointed. The space itself is beautiful with high ceilings and a great view of the city. The decor is similar to other momofukus - minimalist and simple. As with the noodle bar, there is no where to hang your coat... Our server said, ""I guess this is one of those don't-bring-a-lot-of-stuff places"". Okay... good luck in the winter! There are some communal tables as well as smaller ones for groups of 4 or less. 

The menu is designed for sharing, so it's good to come here in a group. While we looked at the menu, they brought out some chopped cucumber in a spicy vinegar-y dressing. Refreshing. There is an a la carte menu as well as menu items that are designed for larger groups (referred to as ""large format"" dining on their website). You are supposed to call and order ahead, but since today was the opening day, they had some of those options available. We decided to have the fried chicken, which easily could have served 9-10 people even though it says it's for 4-6 ($125). It was served on a platter, family-style with some garlic and ginger dipping sauces, scallion pancakes, radishes, lettuce, and tabasco salt. A LOT of food! The chicken was so juicy and the skin was crispy, with a nice spiciness, without being too salty. We also ordered some steamed buns as appetizers. They were not the famous pork belly buns, but had Canadian peameal bacon in them with some sweet mustard. We looked at the other tables who ordered the family-style platters -- there is a bo ssam (whole pork butt), beef short rib, and beef ribeye. The portions were also huge! For dessert, we had another sharing item - the pear trifle. Frangipane, bourbon, crispy black sesame + black sesame ice cream. Interesting mix of flavours and a nice way to end the meal. Drink options include cocktails, wine, beer, and sake + some non-alcoholic drinks (mocktails hehe!). The cocktails were expensive, $16-20. I had one with gin, kasu, lychee, sparking water. It was smooth and potent, not too sweet. 

Service was attentive - our server was able to answer any questions we had (like why are there random numbers next to items on the menu?) and kept our waters filled. Oh and one of the servers has a hello kitty tattoo! So cute! The ambiance is nice - it's a fine dining kind of place without feeling stuffy; you could show up here in jeans or a suit and be equally comfortable. It gets noisy, but you're still able to have a conversation since the music is kept at a reasonable volume. Our meal came to $60 per person including tax, tips, drinks, which was less than I expected. Momofuku Daisho is definitely a great addition to the Toronto restaurant scene! I look forward to coming back and seeing how the menu changes."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"This spa has a lot going for it. It is a stone's throw from the Eaton Centre, Yonge and Dundas Square, etc. so it is really central and close to a lot. At the same time, tucked away on the 5th floor of the Pantages Hotel, it still feels really quiet and calm. It's a great spot for an urban getaway! I am always looking for spas that have nice facilities with extra like saunas/steam rooms so that you can get 1 or 2 services and then make an afternoon out of it. 

I came here recently for the 'tranquility' treatment. It included exfoliation, a body wrap, and then a hot stone massage (90 mins.). The treatment was so relaxing, I fell asleep. I remember thinking that for $125 (special discounted price for weekdays, available through wayspa.com) this felt like a total getaway, but was way cheaper than a flight to some tropical island;) Total bliss... Even when I was in the body wrap, the RMT massaged my scalp. Amazing... They used products that smelled so nice too... 

From start to finish, everything was so professional and every detail was looked after (e.g. I have long hair and they gave me a hair elastic at reception before I even asked!). The receptionist showed me to my locker and then after I got changed, brought me to the comfy waiting area where they have magazines, tea, water, croissants, and plush reclining chairs. After my treatment, I opted to use their jacuzzi, sauna, and steam room facilities across the hall (slightly awkward, because you have to walk past the elevators and hotel gym). On a weekday afternoon, I had the whole area to myself! Everything was well-maintained and clean. The decor is very zen and adds to the ambiance. 

The change room is a bit small (only one shower), but was fine when I visited since it wasn't busy. They provide shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, hair spray, and a few other basics. 

This place is not as luxe/fancy as places like Hammam Spa or Stillwater, but the service (at least the one I tried) was excellent, people are friendly, and the value is great. I would come back here for sure! 

For comparison to other places with saunas/steam rooms: I also like sweetgrass spa but their sauna is much smaller. I tried Body Blitz (adelaide location) but found it too crowded/noisy. Stillwater was pretty nice, but I went several years ago and haven't been recently. Hammam spa has an awesome steam room, but no sauna or jacuzzi, and is more expensive. Laya Spa has a nice steam room and great yoga classes in the same space, although it is a smaller spa with only a small, co-ed change room. For the best value if I just want a good sweat/steam without any spa services, I would go to Seoul Zimzilbang (Korean sauna) for $20! 

Tip: check out their page on wayspa.com to see their monthly promotions and other deals. They also have same day deals where you can add an extra service to your booking (when you arrive at reception) for a discounted price."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"I love the concept of this not-for-profit shop and it makes total sense to me as wedding dress prices are crazy, especially considering that you only wear it for a few hours! There is also so much waste created by the whole wedding industry/machine, so it's nice to try and find more sustainable options when possible. There are lots of online options for second hand wedding dresses, but it's really nice to be able to try things on in person. Sample sales are another great way to save $$$ on the dress, but being a petite person, most sample sales I came across were size 8-12 and much too big for me (alterations can only do so much). 

The prices are ridiculously low! Average dresses are around $600 I was told. I did notice a special rack of higher end dresses on the main floor, but the vast majority of the dresses were under $1000. With that in mind, the selection could be hit or miss, it really depends on what types of dresses have been recently donated. I went once and did not find the dress, but I would totally go back in a few months and try my luck again if I can't find something elsewhere. Staff told me that the fall is a good time to visit, as a lot of brides donate their dresses after their summer weddings. 

The volunteers working here are friendly and pretty hands off, which actually suited me well as I like to try things on in peace. I liked being allowed to just peruse the racks at my leisure. Appointments are a must and it was only me and one other bride there on a Saturday morning. Luckily, she was a different size from me so we were in completely different rooms. There are no formal fitting rooms. You are in one of the rooms full of dresses and can just close the door and try on things there. My only complaint is that there is a mirror but it is not completely full length and there's no platform thing, so it may be hard to see all the details of the dress's hem. 

I saw a lot of beautiful gowns from big designers I came across in my research like Vera Wang, Maggie Sottero, Mori Lee, Pronovias, Catherine Langlois, Watters etc. Condition of the dresses was mostly okay, but some had some wear and tear or dirt on the bottom, so factor in dry cleaning costs for sure. However, there were some brand new dresses - donated from local bridal boutiques, so if one of them suits you, you could really luck out! Prices and brands are clearly marked. 

There's also a little room of accessories and I found some good deals there. Lots of wedding shoes for only $25 (designer shoes like the popular Bagdley Mishka jeweled ones were $75, a total steal!), hair accessories, robes (who really wears those white ""bride"" robes more than once?), and belts. There is also an entire room of veils upstairs. 

Online booking is easy. They email you with instructions (bring indoor shoes to wear, don't wear makeup, etc.). 

I recommend checking this place out! I plan to donate my dress here after my wedding."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"This is one of the first yoga studios in Toronto that I tried back around 2004. Then I was living out of town for a few years. I recently moved back and ended up at various other studios with my Passport to Prana. I went back to Downward Dog today for the first time in about a year (I used to take Martin's class, I don't think he teaches here anymore?). I have to say, after having experienced various other studios, it's still my favourite. This place has been around for ages (apparently Madonna and Sting have taken class at DD when they were in town..., also, the founder Diane Bruni used to host ""Breathing Space Yoga"" on WTN) and has been consistent in the quality of the teachers and commitment to ashtanga yoga. I've seen too many other studios jump on the hot yoga bandwagon or try to offer too many styles of yoga or mix in things like pilates or ""yoga-lates"" or whatever it's called. DD sticks to what it knows and what it does best. It is not the fanciest/nicest studio (change rooms get reeeally crowded between classes), but you are guaranteed a great workout and experience. 

I have to agree with Stephen L., they have some of the most challenging classes in the city. I am not very advanced but I have been practicing yoga on and off for about 7 years. I used to do the ""prep"" classes here years ago. Today I decided to try the level 1 class (Sunday 9 am, taught by David Bruni). I was told that in addition to some yoga blocks I also needed a piece of dowel (to roll under your feet), and this really intense rubber band loop thing. They didn't have those props the last time I came to the studio, so I was kind of alarmed at what I might have gotten myself into:S While waiting for the class to start, I was just sitting there stretching my hamstrings... meanwhile this ripped shirtless guy in front of me is calmly standing on his head... Yeah. A little intimidating! At the beginning of class, David asked us to go from plank to chaturanga and then back up to plank as many times as we could (like yoga push-ups). ""I want to see how strong this class is"", he said. After watching people struggle through, he waived his hand - ""I've seen enough"". Anyways, suffice to say that ""level 1"" is NOT for beginners. But this is yoga after all, and it's not a competitive atmosphere and after my initial panic (I can't stand on my head...), it turned out to be an excellent and invigorating class. Challenging, fast-paced, with lots of attention thanks to the 2 teachers' assistants who helped with corrections and adjustments. 

Great place, convenient location (so many post-yoga weekend brunch options!), always reliable, nice yoga community with no attitude. Sure, you'll spot some lululemon, but it doesn't feel like a fashion show like at some other studios. Also, if you forgot your mat, you can use one of the studio's for free (many other places charge). Try it out if you are serious about yoga, and be prepared to sweat!!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"Having visited different onsens, jimjilbangs, and hammams during my travels, I have always been interested in finding similar experiences around Toronto. These places are relaxing and social, but not so expensive or luxurious as spas (i.e. they are places you could afford to go regularly). So when I saw a groupon for South-Western Bathhouse, which just opened in 2012, I jumped on it! 

A perfect way to pass a lazy Sunday afternoon, I went here with my SC (sauna companion!) over the holidays. Note that weekends are co-ed so you need to bring your swimsuit. For other days, check the schedule on their website because they alternate between men-only and women-only days. You don't need to make any reservations, just show up! It's in a plaza but there's no sign that you can see from the street. Look for the family restaurant and then the door is on the side, with ample parking in the back. 

The regular price is $30 per adult including unlimited use of the facilities and a selection of tea (it's open til midnight, so you could stay all day if you want). The clientele is mostly Russian and on the weekends you'll see couples and groups of friends of all ages. I think the social aspect is big here, so it's not a place I would come alone (compared to other spas like Body Blitz). It's more of a meeting place than a typical ""spa"", i.e. there are no add-on services like massages or facials. The owners are very welcoming to newbies, plus there's a handy beginner's guide on the website that tells you what to expect! http://banya.ca/index.php/steam-russian/

Basically, they give you slippers, a robe, a towel, and a bracelet (which acts as your waterproof locker key). You go to the changerooms (which are quite small and basic, they provide a hair dryer but if you need anything else, bring your own) and get changed. Then you take a shower -- there are stalls with curtains in the main area. Next, you can choose between the main sauna (banya) which is the largest, the Finnish dry sauna, or the Turkish steam room. In between steaming, you can take a dip in the cold pool or douse yourself under the barrel of cold water. Repeat - each time you can gradually increase your time in the sauna. There are some lounge chairs to rest between ""cycles"", or you can go out to the living room where there are sofas and a TV playing Russian programs. Play cards, chat, read a book... I brought a cooling face mask to apply while lying on the sofa. Ahhh... 

Don't forget to stop by the small, homestyle restaurant. You can get dishes like beef stroganoff or other Russian specialities including soups, sausage, salads and desserts. The place also has a liquor license, although I'd be wary of drinking and passing out in one of the saunas:S The decor is very cozy with antique teapots, stamps, and other paraphernalia on the walls. I tried a beef soup with some parsley and walnuts. It was delicious and totally hit the spot!  

This banya is definitely worth trying out, especially on a cold winter day. Very relaxing and a new cultural experience as well!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"This is a review for the YOGA studio part of Laya, rather than the Spa. 

Laya Spa & Yoga has been around since May. It's a quiet, unassuming spot that is easy to miss because their sign isn't very big. I'm so glad I decided to check it out, because it's really an unexpected oasis of calm on Queen West West. There are many yoga studios in the neighbourhood, but Laya is different in that it is small (yoga classes are limited to 6 students, call ahead to reserve your spot) and the service is very personal. 

THE SPACE: clean, simple, spa-like, with colourful Moroccan touches in the decor. There is a no-shoe policy, you leave your shoes in cubbies at the door. The layout is long and skinny -- it looks really tiny from the street, but it actually has several rooms stretching back. There are treatment rooms, a large room for manicures/pedicures, and the small yoga studio with sliding wooden doors. At the very back there is a unisex changeroom with 2 curtained stalls where you can get changed and 2 showers, as well as lockers (they provide locks). Also, they have *heated floors*. Soooo nice when you are walking around barefoot. It's also really relaxing when you are lying in savasana at the end of yoga (yes, you can feel it through your yoga mat as long as your mat isn't super-thick!). They also always have a big jug of ice water with fresh fruit. 

STAFF: you'll feel like a valued-customer from the moment you enter. The receptionist is friendly and helpful. They make you feel welcome and are happy to answer questions. The owner, Alessandra, teaches most of the yoga classes and also does aesthetics. She's a dedicated teacher and keeps the classes small so that she can provide lots of attention and corrections to students, which I found extremely helpful. She is happy to tailor the class to your energy level that day, specific muscle groups you may want to work on or rest, etc. 

YOGA CLASSES: all classes right now are 1 hour and 15 mins. and are level 1-2 ashtanga/vinyasa flow. They are designed for students who are familiar with the primary series and have already been practicing yoga for a while. I found the classes to be rigorous and challenging but in a supportive environment. You will definitely sweat, but it's also not like she's pushing you beyond what you can do. I later saw on the website that Alessandra did her teacher training at Downward Dog, which would explain why I really liked her style having done lots of classes at Downward Dog myself. She uses music, but it's not your typical new age-y stuff. There's some bossa nova, piano music, and even Rihanna. Maybe some purists would scoff at that, but I thinks it makes class fun. During savasana, she comes around and gives you a mini-head massage which is soooo relaxing. 

I would definitely recommend Laya for yoga. The schedule is up on their website, although they mentioned they are thinking of moving some of the 6pm evening classes to a later time. They currently have a promotion: $20 for 1 week unlimited, $75 for 2 months unlimited. Also, their twitter says they have mimosas on Sundays!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"Love taking class here. This place is perfect for those who used to dance back in the day and still miss it! If you have taken a lot of dance in your youth, it can be tough to find the right fit amidst the whole ballet-fitness craze. There are a lot of adult beginner ballet classes out there (Extension Room actually offers some, so does the National Ballet School adult program, Dance Teq, City Dance Corps, InStudio) but if you have already done a lot of ballet before, the pace can be a bit slow/basic. Then there are intermediate ballet classes at serious ballet studios, but if you aren't dancing regularly anymore, it can be intimidating or too hard! Or the other students will all be really young! Finally, there are barre fitness studios like barre3, barreworks, barre beautiful, etc., which I enjoy for the workout, but they are not that ""dance-y"" if you are craving that. They are more like fitness classes that use the barre as a tool, but there isn't much choreography and most moves are done with feet in parallel, as opposed to proper ballet positions. 

Enter the Extension Room -- the barre 101 class is like a legit ballet barre but with weights for an added upper body challenge (think plies, tendus, degages, adage, grand battements in the same sequence one would expect from an ""real"" ballet class) and the allegro boot camp made me feel like I was really dancing for the first time in ages! I talked with some of the other students and many were like me, people who had studied dance recreationally and were looking for a way to keep dancing in an accessible and fun environment. It helps that all the instructors are/were dancers, often at major ballet/contemporary companies. Watching them demonstrate with beautiful technique is inspiring and they have good eyes for form and give useful corrections. I do think it would be really helpful to have some dance background for these classes, even though they are supposed to be for anyone. That being said, if you have no dance background at all, the barre 101 class is a good place to start (slower pace, barre helps with balance). I found the allegro bootcamp quite challenging (in a good way), and I think it would be hard to keep up for those less familiar with common ballet steps. It is also way harder to do certain steps without the support of the barre! I haven't tried their yoga, mat pilates, or bosu ball classes yet but it looks like there's quite a bit of variety in their schedule. 

Facilities are stunning and make it a pleasure to come here. High ceiling, chandeliers, nice sprung floors, etc. It's not a surprise that the space can be rented our for parties/weddings/corporate functions... I also like that they provide mats and weights, plus there are energy balls and juices/smoothies available for purchase. The change rooms have showers and small lockers. 

The location is a bit random, but actually easy to reach by the 504 streetcar and there is free street parking in the area too. Plus, for Yelper bonus points, it is in close proximity to a number of good snack/coffee spots like Roselle, Tandem Coffee, and Odin;) Very important!!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"I have tried both the barre fitness (with Sydney and director Jamie) and GETnFit class (with founder/director Glenn) here because there was a free 7 day pass special they were offering over the holidays. I first heard about the studio via social media because they were doing free classes at the Harbourfront during the PanAm Games. I was interested because they offer barre classes. While there are a zillion yoga studios in Toronto, there are far less options for barre. 

The studio: 
Great location in the heart of Leslieville (i.e. good post-class brunch/coffee options), easy to get to by the 501 streetcar and there is metered parking on Queen St. as well. The studio is on the 2nd floor. There is a spacious lobby, changeroom (with mat storage), big main studio, and a spinning studio at the back (that I never actually saw). The lobby doubles as an art gallery with rotating displays -- a nice touch. The exposed brick and high ceilings make this a really enjoyable place to work out. No showers or lockers, but most people bring their purses into the studio since there is a lot of room. Everything is clean and looks new. I think there are a lot of regulars here, because a lot of people seemed to know each other. It's nice to have that sense of community. 
One minor thing, for the fitness/barre classes, in addition to the yoga classes, you need to bring your own yoga mat. Not a huge deal, but most barre studios (e.g. barre3, barreworks, extension room) provide mats so you don't need to carry it around -- more convenient if you are running around before/after the class or coming straight from work. 

The classes:
They have a wide variety of class times, which busy people will appreciate. I found even the weekday morning classes to be very busy, but it may have been the new year resolution crowd;) I enjoyed the barre fitness, which was more fast paced than other places I've tried. You'll definitely feel the burn in your lower body! It was less precision/alignment oriented than slower classes, so just make sure you have proper form from the get go. I liked that we used the UGI ball (a weighted ball that looks kinda like a small beanbag chair) after to really tone the upper body. It definitely feels more like a fitness class than a dance class, no fancy footwork required. 
The GETnFit class was more of a circuit/HIIT format and Glenn was awesome at providing encouragement the whole time. We used the UGI ball for most of it. I definitely got a challenging full-body workout here, and the yoga-inspired stretches at the end were a nice cool down. I've never seen UGI balls at other places, so I would come back to take this class again and switch things up from my usual weights/resistance bands. 
It's a place that seems accessible regardless of fitness level. There were definitely some super-jacked ladies in the classes I went to, but also many ""beginners"". Options were always given to dial up or down the intensity of the moves. 

If you're interested in checking Yogathletix out, follow them on social media because they sometimes have promotions or special events/workshops (e.g. bootcamp series, free women's self defense, outdoor yoga). They are also part of ClassPass."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"This place seems quite polarizing based on previous Yelp reviews, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But I came here mainly wanting to check out the hammam experience. This place has been around for a long time, but I never came before because the prices seemed way too high. But they are offering 20% off all online booking this month, so I decided to use my insurance RMT benefits and try it out. A 60 mins. Swedish massage came to $112 instead of $140. Yes, it's expensive but with any service over $100 you get free access to the hammam.

I had a really relaxing experience here, despite it being a busy Saturday. There were a lot of people but it somehow never felt crowded, I never had to wait for a shower, and there was always room to sit in the tea lounge. There were a few instances were people were talking loudly in the changeroom, but generally, I found it much quieter and more relaxing than Body Blitz. It's also nice that it's co-ed (but it means you have to wear either a bathing suit or the wrap they give you... I brought my swimsuit because I think the wrap would still be kinda risque).

From start to finish, the service was excellent. I was given a walk around of the place and the facilities are really clean. Staff were constantly walking around clearing used towels, empty cups, etc. Everything smells amazing too! Eucalyptus oil everywhere... The change rooms have lockers and you can set the code (i.e. no having to keep track of a key). They provide robes (which are enormous, but I have never found a spa where they have small size robes) and slippers (which thankfully come in S/M/L/XL). There are rain showers and all the basics -- blow dryers, hair straightener, body lotion. But bring your own hairbrush. 

After taking a shower, I went to the steam room. It was a lot larger than I expected. It is very steamy and you can barely see in front of you, but there's lots of room to sit and enjoy. It might be too hot for some people, but I loved it. I have been to hammams in Europe before and this was similar. In the hammam area, there are also showers to rinse off, a fridge with cool towels and cucumber water, and 2 suites (for if you buy a package that includes gommage scrub). I went back and forth between the steam room and the tea lounge (which has hot and iced tea, fruit, and magazines). You don't need to watch the time for your booked service, because once you arrive the staff know you are in the facility so they will call your name either in the steam room or the lounge. I thought that was nice, but it still would've been useful to have a clock somewhere. 

My massage was with Connie, and it was great. Some people find the service rooms noisy (you can hear people walk by), but I was in a room that was farther away and it was fine. Connie checked in a few times to make sure the pressure was good. I didn't have any particular area of focus, but found the massage really relaxing and almost fell asleep... The massage table is heated too, which was nice. 

Overall, this was a great escape in the middle of the city and the only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because it is so expensive (I wish we had a hammam experience in Toronto that was more social and affordable enough that one could go regularly). But it is definitely a nice treat!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"Came here for the first time recently for a RMT Swedish massage. 

The lobby is stunning with lots of waterfalls everywhere (I guess ""Stillwater"" is a bit of a misnomer). I had booked my appointment over the phone. At reception, they gave me a leather case with my ""spa itinerary"" -- I guess this is more useful for those who book multiple services. And the case also had a health sheet -- pretty standard survey of medical conditions, medications, etc. The guy told me not to worry about filling it out right away, as I could do so later in the Tea Lounge. He showed me around, gave me a key to the changeroom and a pair of slippers. 

In the changeroom, I went to my designated locker (they are numbered) where there was a terry cloth robe and bath towel. Nice lockers -- a separate drawer for small items (e.g. watch, glasses), lots of hangers, and you lock it by picking a 4 digit code (like hotel safes) so you don't have to worry about carrying around a key. Since I was an hour early, I took a shower and used the jacuzzi and wet/dry saunas. It was a weekday afternoon and for most of the time, there was no one else there so it was blissfully quiet. I also enjoyed the little beds/TV viewing stations... I've never seen this before and it is sort of a weird concept to me (I thought the point of spas were to get away from technology?). But it was kinda fun to get my CBC fix while waiting for my massage. The change room has toothbrushes, razors, combs, cotton swabs, etc. in case you forgot something. 

The Tea Lounge is pretty big with couches as well as an area with tables and chairs that almost looks like a restaurant. There's lots of tea, cucumber water, biscotti, and apples. There wasn't a great selection of reading material and several people seemed to have brought their own books/magazines. 

The massage itself was wonderful. My masseuse was Leah and she was thoughtful, professional, and pleasant. You get a choice of music (""spa music"", chill out, classical, piano, jazz). I chose piano and must say... it was kinda hokey. I thought it was gonna be Chopin or something, but it was more like new age-y/easy listening fusion. Next time, I'll try classical. You also can choose unscented/lavender/eucalyptus/grapefruit massage oil. I went with lavender, which was nice and not too overpowering. The massage table itself is heated. Sooo nice. During the massage, I was wrapped up in a duvet. It's like getting tucked into bed when you're little! At the end, she puts hot towels over my feet - it felt super-relaxing. I think I fell asleep for a bit near the end. Pressure was just right for me. I did hear the subway rumbling by a few times, but I'm used to falling asleep to the sound of a streetcar so I didn't mind. The sound of public transit is oddly soothing to me... After the massage, you leave your treatment room and there is a curtain in the hallway so that it's not as jarring to go from the dark massage room to bright lights outside. Leah gave me back the leather case thing, with a separate receipt I could use for insurance purposes. 

In summary, a wonderful oasis of calm in the city, highly recommended! The facilities are very nice, clean, and aesthetically pleasing but for me, what makes Stillwater stand out is the impeccable service. It is expensive, but if you have health benefits that pay for RMT massages, this is a great option."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"Pure Barre just opened in Toronto - the first international location of this popular US chain barre studio. I took a free class during their opening weekend. I have a dance background and love the idea of barre fitness. I've taken classes at barre3, barreworks, extension room, and yogathletix for comparison. 

Pure Barre is a huge brand in the US and I'd heard a lot about it, so I was definitely intrigued. The workout is low impact but challenging. They use weights, resistance bands, and a small ball. The floor is carpeted which I found a bit weird, but the owner (Paige) explained that it helps cushion the foot from doing so many moves on one foot. The pace is fast than most barre workouts, especially the first part of class. I got a good workout, however I felt that I could've gotten a better workout if the moves were demonstrated or cued more. The instructor demos the move and then walks around the room to correct form. I really appreciated the individual attention, but sometimes she would call out a change to the move and I didn't know what she meant. I would look around and everyone else was lost too. So I spent some parts making up my own moves or trying to figure out what was going on. 

I also found that we could have used the resistance band more (we only did a few stretches with it). I am not sure how the ball was that effective. I prefer classes with a small weighted ball for added resistance, or a bigger pilates squish-y ball which helps support the low back or can be used for hamstring curls or to hold between the legs to ensure inner thighs are engaged. But this ball was so small and light, I didn't find it added much to the moves. All this being said, it was cool to see the barre used in different ways (e.g. moves sitting on the floor with arms handing on the barre overhead) and I liked the emphasis on ""LTB"" - lift, tone, burn! Lots of small isometric movements. I still prefer a slower pace with more reps, but this type of barre class would likely to appeal to those with a more ""hardcore"" or athletic workshop approach. It's great for legs and glutes, especially. 

My BB (barre buddy!) and I spoke with Paige after class and she explained that instructors don't offer modifications to the whole class (just individuals) because they don't want people to take the ""easier"" option when they can push themselves more. So, it's a different philosophy compared to some other barre places or yoga/pilates studios. 

As for the studio -- great location, beautiful decor, nice attention to details. Nice retail selection at the front, with hard to find Alo apparel. 

I'm not sure I'd rush to go back, though I'm sure the workout improves as you get more familiar with it. If they join classpass or have any specials, I might try to go back. But for now I think I will stick with barre3 which seems to be a better fit for me. 

Need to mention:
- Socks that cover toes are mandatory
- No shorts and tops must cover midrif 
- No changeroom, just 2 very large washroom stalls. 
- No showers, but it's not a super-sweaty workout. 
- Small lockers provided (no locks) 
- Very friendly and approachable staff that are clearly passionate about pure barre the brand and the technique
- Good music, and headset makes it easy to hear the instructor
- Very active on social media -- they have some kind of challenge coming up if you are into those!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"Guilt-free dining at its best! This is a great place to take health-conscious friends or to go to for a little detox. Located on Bay and Wellington, in the basement of Far Niente, this is definitely a welcome addition to the Financial District's somewhat overpriced and predictable restaurant scene.

Although all mains are under 650 calories and all desserts less than 200 (how do they do that?), this is far from being a restaurant solely for people on diets!! The food is just fresh, light and delicious. Although it's not a vegetarian restaurant, there are tons of veggie options and it reminded me of some of the haute vegetarian places I've tried in San Francisco. There are also gluten-free options. 

They have a decent wine list and sell wine by the half glass (3 oz.), glass (6 oz.) or bottle. I opted instead for a blackberry apple cocktail ($11) which was refreshing and actually came in a really big glass. 

I started with the Malaysian coconut soup ($6) which was flavourful and just a little spicy. Bonus points for actual quality pieces of chicken breast, rather than the usual crappy-scrappy meat that ends up in soup. My friend had the raw and pickled beet salad, which was massive and served with Bartlett pears, goat cheese, and sunflower seeds. Must've been 3 servings of vegetables right there! My other dining companion had the crab and corn cake, which looked great. 

For mains, I tried the grilled chicken breast ($17.50) which was sort of Moroccan-style, served with apricots, nuts and yogurt with a small bowl of rice. The chicken was succulent and tasty, and the sauce was delicious -- I just wish there were more of it. After scraping the plate clean, I was left to eat the remainder of the chicken dry. I guess that's how they keep to the calorie limit. My friend who ordered the smoked sable fish (which our waiter got really excited about -- ""do you recommend the sable fish?"" ""YES!! OMG so good!"" ""ok...""), complained of the same thing -- not enough sauce! (in that case a passion fruit mustard glaze). Nonetheless, still very satisfying and portion sizes were good, leaving just enough room for dessert. 

Desserts were divine and surprisingly rich. Rather than a dessert menu, the waiter just brought out a tray of shot glass desserts. Brilliant - you get to see what the options are and then you can just grab and eat it right away! There were healthy options like a passion fruit salad, as well as more standard fare, like tiramisu and cheesecake. I went for the tiramisu, which was wonderful. Despite the small portion size, it somehow feels like you are eating more because they give you the tiniest of spoons. Clever. Also, at $2 a pop, you can try more than one if you wish. 

The space is cool and modern, if a bit too dark. There are flat screen TV's projecting random landscape photos. I went on a weeknight, which wasn't terribly busy. I made a reservation on Open Table but probably didn't have to. Service was okay. Our waiter was very cute and a bit too charming... My friend said she didn't trust him because when she asked him to suggest a wine to go with her sable fish, he suggested the most expensive one on the menu. 

All in all though, a solid dining option when you feel like being healthy but have exhausted all the vegetarian restaurants. Also looks like a good late-night dining option, as there are several small sharing dishes on the menu. I'll definitely be back soon!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"With all the 'rustic Italian' restos opening lately, it's easy to overlook Mangia & Bevi, a brother and sister run restaurant which has been around since 2005. But anyone who is willing to give this place a shot will be in for a treat! 

I imagine this place is busy during lunch hour from workers in the building and nearby offices. But I came on a Sunday evening and it was nice and quiet. We got a table without a reservation. 

The address says King St., but there is no sign on the entrance on King St. (an office building with a large parking lot in front). Just look for ""260"" and enter the front door. Alternately, there is an entrance on Ontario St. (And after 6pm and on weekends, the King St. door is locked, so for sure go through Ontario St.). 

FOOD: simple, homemade Italian staples. You will find a selection of antipasti, paninis (lunch only), pastas and pizzas. Unlike many other Italian restaurants, there are no 'primi' (or meat-based entrees). 
My party shared the Bufalina ($14) (vine tomatoes, bufala mozzarella, arugula, basil, olive oil) and the Funghi Nordica ($14)(sauteed mixed mushrooms, shaved parmigiano, arugula, olive oil, balsamic vinegar) to start. Both were spot on. 
For the pasta dishes, they don't specify the type of noodle because I think it changes from day to day. On this day, they were making all the dishes with fusilli. I had the Norma ($14) -- eggplant, fresh basil, and a generous dollop of ricotta cheese, with a tomato sauce. The pasta was really firm. Definitely al dente, but I actually would've preferred it just a tiny bit more cooked. The sauce was really flavourful and fresh. The ricotta on top was cold, which made for a nice contrast. Had a bite of one DC's pizza (the daily special -- which had artichokes, onions, and porchetta), and it was delicious! 
For dessert, they only have one offering. But when that offering is an impeccable tiramisu ($6), you don't really need anything else. The tiramisu is one of the lightest I've ever had. I don't know what they mixed in with the marscapone cheese, but it is celestial. The cake at the bottom is drenched in grand marnier without being soggy, and has just a hint of orange flavour. I smile just thinking about it...

WINE: good selection available by the glass/half litre/bottle. There are a lot more reds than whites. 

AMBIANCE: the space is cozy and warm with vintage Italian posters on the exposed-brick walls. There is a huge rack of magazines at the front, presumably for those waiting for takeout or solo diners (or I guess, couples who have run out of things to talk about:P). There is a separate room off the one side that looks like it would be a great place for a small private party. At the back, you can see (and smell) pizza coming out fresh from the oven. There's a TV at the bar, locked on TSN. When we arrived, they were playing the hockey game and it was kind of noisy. But shortly after we ordered, they put it on mute and started playing some music (some bossa nova, then Adele's CD).

SERVICE: our waiter was relaxed and friendly. He was able to give some advice to indecisive diners about what to order (everything sounded so good!). I like a waiter with an opinion. He almost brought us our tiramisu without the cocoa powder sprinkled on top, but right before he got to our table, turned around to correct that. So we had a good laugh about that! The back of the servers' t-shirts says: 12"" uncut. Referring to the pizza, of course. 

ETC: the women's washroom is actually outside of the restaurant just across the hallway in the little alcove. You need to push #1 and #4 to unlock the door. Just make sure to lock it behind you too!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"Came here for a facial after hearing raves from many sources. Pure + Simple has long had a reputation as being one of the best spas for facials in the city. They also have a retail store downstairs with high end natural skin care products. 

I booked the ""cool as a cucumber"" facial, on special this month for $89. But after talking to my aesthetician about my skin concerns (mostly dryness) she suggested the super hydrating facial ($110) or aquabrasion facial ($155). I went with the former. I am not someone who gets regular facials, so I just wanted to start with something basic. 

My aesthetician asked me a lot of questions about my health, skin, diet, etc. She obviously knew what she was talking about, but I found the whole experience actually kind of stressful for 2 reasons:

1. My skin is on the dry side. It has always been dry and I do my best to take care of it and moisturize (and uh, yeah, that is why I was there to get a facial in the first place). She interrogated me and lectured me so much, it felt like being at the dentist. E.g. when I responded that I think my diet and nutrition are pretty good, she was all ""pretty good? What does that mean huh?"" And than accusing me of not drinking enough water when I actually make an effort to drink throughout the day (I work in health care myself, I know these things!). I understand they need to ask these questions and it is to help give suggestions for better skin, but the approach was very hostile. The weird thing is my skin is not terrible (if I'm in my 30's and still get carded at LCBO, doesn't that say something?)! I am happy with it for the most part and generally live a very healthy lifestyle. The way she spoke to me you would think I'm a binge-drinking smoker that sleeps with makeup on and never wears sunscreen. She had no tact and made me feel like I had horrible skin. It's like some people have dry skin... or oily skin... or acne or wrinkles, and sometimes this is influenced by factors out of our control like genetics, environment... it's not like we all have less than ideal skin because we are bad/lazy people. She made it all about how my dry skin is all my fault and how could I walk around with this atrocious skin?!? 

2. The upselling strategy was HARD from start to finish. Like, I get that the initial facial I chose was not the best for my skin type, so I happily switched. But on top of that, then she ""suggested"" I add an ampule of collagen treatment, because my horribly dry skin needs it so bad. I felt really pressured so I went ahead and added it on for $30. After the treatment, she proceeded to tell me how all my tried and true Kiehl's skincare products are not good for me and I need to buy ALL new skin products (except one cream that I am ""allowed"" to keep using). I ended up buying a cleansing oil and cleansing milk, adding up to around $80, kind of to appease her. Yet she still pressured me to buy a $130 serum, a cream, and a $50 tiny bottle of sunscreen and I finally had to put my foot down there. I got some samples instead. I know their products are great, but not everyone is prepared to drop hundreds of dollars on new skincare just like that. I like to do my research (and I also like to shop at Sephora or Shopper's where I can get points for these expensive purchases!). 

I think her strategy was to try and make me feel terrible about my skin and then push all these products on me. I hate to say that it kind of worked. I am using my new products and they are great! It's just the style and approach that left a sour taste in my mouth. While she was very knowledgeable, I go to a spa for some TLC and pampering, not to be talked down to. 

I am giving Pure + Simple 4 stars still, because the facial *itself* was great. My skin felt amazing after, extractions were not painful, and the head/neck massage was really nice. The front desk staff were very kind and the space is clean and calming. I would definitely go back, but I would just ask for a different aesthetician."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"I have a doppelganger, and she is a professional food writer. This Yelp review is dedicated to Gizelle Lau. Thank you. 

Came here for brunch, party of four. They don't take reservations for brunch, but we were able to snag a table, no problem. As we perused the menu, we admired the rustic decor and quirky light fixtures. Our server brought us water and told us about the specials, which included a salmon eggs benny and homemade red fife donuts dusted in sugar. 

We ordered the donuts to share. They were delicious, bite-size wonders... Like really fancy timbits! We were pleasantly surprised when the server brought out a basket of pastries on the house. It included mini croissants, a berry scone, muffin, and ginger snap cookies. Everything was warm out of the oven and divine. They were served with some fresh fruit preserves. I only wished there was a bit more, because it came in a tiny dish that was a bit tricky to share between 4. 

For mains, I went with the smoked whitefish dill crepe, which was served on a wooden slab with creme fraiche, hen of the woods (mushrooms, not poultry!), and some caviar garnish. It was a small portion, so I'd suggest ordering it with a side or a starter. The crepe was just lovely. It was light and flavourful without being overpoweringly fishy. I had a bite of my DC's confit pork belly -- melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Other DC's had the eggs benny and duck confit on cinnamon bun bread pudding. Both looked amazing and received thumbs up from my DC's. 

At this point, we were pretty full and all agreed that this was the best brunch we've had in a long time (and we go out for brunch a lot!). The dishes are creative and interesting, while ingredients are organic and locally-sourced. 

Our server cleared our plates (which we had all licked clean!) and set out new cutlery. This was a bit puzzling, but we didn't think much of it. Then she returned with another dish that ""the kitchen sent over"" for us -- bison pemmican (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pemmican) pasta. They were like dumplings in a light broth with kale, almonds, elderberry, and popped red fife (a heritage bread wheat). Omg, this was amazing... The red fife really added a unique flavour and texture, and the pasta itself was comfort food for a cold, wintery day. It turns out that this is a starter from their dinner menu. Get this if you are here for dinner in February, before the menu changes next month! 

Now, we were reeeally full after such a satisfying brunch. Our server comes back: ""I hope you saved room, because we've got dessert coming!"" We thought they'd send over one thing, but they actually brought out all 3 of their dessert options: screech cake, a gelato trio, and crème brûlée. They were all fantastic, but the latter was the winner for me. 

The whole situation was quite mysterious, until the sous chef came to our table to ask how the food was. Then he looks at me -- ""you're Gizelle Lau right?"" Uhhh... Although part of me was thinking, 'for food this incredible, I can be whoever you want me to be'... my conscience got the better of me and I told the truth (we googled her promptly, and found that she is a food writer who contributes to Toronto Life, WHERE, and other publications). I felt like I had disappointed everyone... but as a consolation, I left a ""You've Been Yelped"" card on the table and am writing this review. We left a big tip and apologized about the identity confusion as we left. Perhaps it was the fact that I was snapping pics on my phone and talking to my friends about star-ratings (as I was planning my Yelp review) that threw them for a loop. Maybe my friends should start calling me 'Gizelle' in public. 

That said, I honestly would've given Keriwa Cafe 5 stars even without the sweet freebies! And although, we were given special treatment, I did see the sous chef go to other tables to chat and ask how people liked their food. You can bet we'll be back soon to try their dinner menu!

(Update: looks like the real Gizelle liked it too! http://www.postcity.com/Eat-Shop-Do/Eat/February-2012/Cheap-Eat-of-the-Week-Keriwa-Cafes-brunch-basket/)"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"So I came back for a 2nd ""super hydrating facial"" with a different aesthetician. This one was less stern and more friendly, but unfortunately I had another lacklustre experience. 

I know I am an outlier, as P&S has been well known for their amazing facials for many years. I love their philosophy of clean beauty and have even read Kristen Ma's book ""Beauty: Pure + Simple"". I recognize this might be the right place for SOME people, but wanted to share my experience so others know what to expect. 

I was once again told my skin is dry and given a long list of instructions that I ""must"" do to ""fix"" my skin. I am not sure how much of this had to do with the fact that I was getting married in a few months. I am not sure if they were trying to take advantage of me, thinking they could prey on typical bridal insecurities? Or pressure me into things because my ""big day"" was coming up. 

Anyways, I was sort of alienated by what seemed to me extreme or unreasonable suggestions such as:
- Get a RMT massage every single week to make the skin around my décolletage look better since it will show with the style of my wedding dress.
- Get a facial every 2 weeks. Oh and of course, she said I should've started doing regular facials much earlier (for the record, I started 3 months before the wedding)... ""it's gonna be hard to make much of a difference in this short time..."" 
- Take prescription antibiotics to ""clear up"" bacteria on my forehead and then take probiotics to ""replenish"" the good bacteria. She actually suggested I get my doctor to give me ORAL (i.e. systemic) antibioitics to fix my skin. 
- Do something about my freckles and my upper lip hair. This came in the form of ""so are you okay with these freckles?"" (Um, yes. I didn't say anything. But thanks for suggesting I shouldn't be okay with them). ""Are you planning to DO something for hair removal here before your wedding?"" (Um, no. Everyone person has tiny hairs on their cheeks, upper lip etc. that are visible when you shine a bright light and look at the skin under a magnifying glass... it is totally natural and I didn't appreciate her suggestion I need to get rid of it. I'm also not a hairy person, quite the opposite. Also, even if I WAS a hairy person with noticeable upper lip hair, I think it would be rude to point this out unless the person asked about it directly). 
- Use a sheet mask every other night. 

There were other suggestions too but I think I zoned out. Maybe if I was a rich Rosedale socialite, I'd have time for all this, but as a ""regular"" person I found some of the suggestions laughable, unrealistic, or unaffordable. She also kept saying things like ""oh your skin will look so nice... your face will look so small."" I thought that was really weird. Um, your face doesn't change SIZE from a facial (or anything else). I never said my goal was the shrink my face. WTF? 

Like the 1st time I went, I got upsold into some ""extras"" that added up to about $50 (I think some hyaluronic acid supplement and something else). I know I shouldn't have caved, but I just felt so exhausted from all the pressure and shaming. The facial this time was even LESS relaxing because she didn't do as much head/neck massage. Then came the extractions which were so painful I was literally tearing up (which she noticed, but just dabbed my tears with kleenex and kept going, saying it's normal). I have a high pain threshold. This was 10x worse than a brazillian wax. I have never had such painful extractions before. What's worse, afterwards, I had scarring and thickening of the skin under my nose (not breakouts, but redness and peeling scar tissue- hard to describe) that did not clear up for TWO weeks. It looked awful and was really embarrassing. Needless to say, I did NOT return like she told me to, as I did not want this weird skin reaction on my wedding day. 

I thought maybe something was wrong with me and I'm just not a facial person. I was like ""people pay for and enjoy this? This is really stressful!"" But I recently went to Radford studios just around the corner from P&S (inside Yorkville Village) and had a wonderful experience! The aesthetician ironically told me that I had *great* skin. 

I still have a 3rd facial left at P&S (I bought a package of 3 to save a bit of money, not knowing that each time they would pressure me to add things and I'd end up paying closer to $150+ for each facial). I think I am just going to refuse any add ons and just tell them to do the facial and that I can get my skin care advice elsewhere. 

2 stars (instead of 1) because some of the products are excellent. I love their cleansing milk and am glad I discovered it!"
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"It pains me to write this review, but as an honest Yelper, I call 'em as I see 'em. I've been here twice within the past month and had 2 very different experiences. 

2nd visit:
Came back on a Friday night, party of 5, with a reservation. I was excited to take my DC's here after my pretty good 1st visit. I was late, and 2 of my DC's arrived early. Apparently, they were asked to move tables, so they were given 2 glasses of white wine on the house. Nice. We were seated at the back, along the wall with the black, white and pink graffiti. I had a great view of the open kitchen (more on that later...).

We were disappointed that they were sold out of the suckling pig. However, I don't see that as a bad thing. It means that they get their meat very fresh and order in small quantities, and our server (the same server I had on the 1st visit, an older and very Italian gentleman with cool round glasses!) was quite apologetic.

Between us, we ordered:
- Salumi board with mortadella, wild boar salame, and ragusano cheese.
- Octopus carpaccio
- Seared tuna encrusted with sesame seeds
- Ricotta ravioli with fresh tomato sauce and toasted almonds
- Pasta special - spaghetti with half a lobster in tomato sauce
- Whole red snapper
- Tiramisu
- Chocolate souffle
- Rasberry gelato

The dinner started off great. Our server was very jovial and attentive with water, etc. The place was packed and the atmosphere was fun and lively. Appetizers came quickly, and I especially enjoyed the mortadella. The octopus was also excellent.

Then things went bad. There was a super-long lag (almost an hour?) before our mains came out. Open kitchens are great, but it also allowed us to witness some drama between the staff. I don't know what happened. At first, it just looked like the kitchen staff were stressed out and overwhelmed, as the whole restaurant was full and they were obviously busy. On several occasions, I saw the chef, Roberto, help himself to wine at the bar and he kept drinking through the night. Suddenly, there was yelling (very brief, but loud enough to cause some awkwardness amongst diners) and the chef stormed out to the back of the restaurant, quickly followed by another guy (the manager? he didn't seem like one of the servers). I watched the rest of the kitchen staff look stressed as the chef was gone for a good 15 mins. or so.

The pasta dishes finally came out. I had the ravioli and quite enjoyed the mix of flavours and textures. Had a bite of the tuna, which was delicious. However, they really dropped the ball on the whole red snapper. I saw the fish get brought out of the oven and placed on a plate in parchment paper. I don't know why, but our poor server was left to debone the fish himself (standing at the bar, no less). The fish came out plopped haphazardly on the plate with a few random vegetables. Seriously, the 'plating' was not presentable at all for a reastaurant of this quality. He brought it to our table and clearly improvising, started drizzling olive oil (the same one we used for our bread) over it. [Later, one of my DC's mentioned that it was supposed to come with a sauce, which was missing. She had seen the fish dish at another table and those diners sent it back to the kitchen, which may have precipitated the drama... ]. But my DC's were too polite to complain or make a scene. We were here to celebrate and just wanted to make the most of the evening. The fish was bland and my polite DC's just asked for salt and pepper to give it some flavour. Maybe they wanted to send it back but were worried that we would have to wait another hour if we ordered something else, since the chef at that point was still gone.

The chef and that other guy returned and things were back in order in the kitchen eventually. By the time we ordered desserts and espressos, they were back in the zone. The tiramisu was spot on -- letting the simple freshness of the ingredients speak for itself. I tried the rasberry gelato which is made in-house. It was bursting with flavour. So, at least we ended on a high note. However, I found the kitchen staff's behaviour unprofessional and I only gave the server a huge tip because I felt bad for him having to deal with everything and the bad fish was not his fault. In hectic circumstances, he tried to smile and keep it together admirably. But charging full price ($60) for that fish was really unacceptable. Sending out an incomplete dish and hoping patrons don't notice is just wrong. While the kitchen drama was actually somewhat entertaining, it makes me not want to return, even though I had such a good 1st visit. Maialino Enoteca... when they're ON, they are great, but when they are OFF, watch out."
alUuOskFSl1bODjnce2PpQ,"I actually just cancelled my membership, but not because I did not enjoy coming to this gym. I would say if you can come often and are a fitness junkie that can make use of all the facilities, it is worth the hefty price tag. I was a member here for just over 1 year. I'm much more of a yoga/pilates studio person and I almost never go to the gym just to use machines/free weights etc. I joined Equinox though, because they have a great variety of classes and their instructors are some of the best (a few are well known from boutique fitness studios). I thought it would be a good ""one stop shop"" for me, however I find ClassPass allows me greater flexibility and variety of class times. The latest weeknight classes are 6:30pm (or the odd 7pm) and 5:30pm on Fridays, which was quite limiting for me as I often work too late to make it for those ones. 

CLASSES: my favourites are trilogy barre with Paulina or Callie (both also teach at barreworks) or Derrick (very innovative class with resistance bands attached to the barre), dance classes (they offer Werq which is like a cardio dance class and they also have hip hop), vinyasa yoga with Ella, hot yin with Jaffer, and Stacked (HIIT). Quality of instruction is usually very good. All the teachers pay attention to your form and have intelligently sequenced classes. If you start going to the same class regularly, the bonus is that the instructors know you and can give you more personalized feedback. Do note that the most popular classes (barre, TRX, spinning, and treadmill) require signing up online. It opens up 26 hours before the class time, and often fills up very quickly. It's a little annoying as the weekend classes fill up so quickly you literally need to set yourself an alarm and sign up the second the spots open up... 

GYM: the cardio machines, weight machines, and other equipment (resistance bands, medicine balls, UGI balls, TRX...) are in great condition, but like I said, I mainly used the club for the classes. There is the main gym area upstairs and a smaller one downstairs, which is nice if you want somewhere quiet. There are always trainers walking around in case you need some tips. If you are someone who enjoys working out independently and wants to have a variety of tools at your disposal, this would be a great place for you. Never overcrowded. 

FACILITIES: The place is always impeccable and the staff are so friendly. The refrigerated eucalyptus-scented towels are a nice touch. It's nice to go for yoga and not have you lug around your own mat. They use high quality Manduka mats and even clean them for you after class. The changerooms make this place!! The steam room is soooo relaxing after a tough workout and Khiel's products feel fancy. In peak times it may be hard to get a spot to blowdry your hair. This is Yorkville -- many of these women spend forever doing their hair/makeup... There are laptops to use although I never see anyone on them. The reception area is a good place to chill and read after working out. Wifi is fast and there's IQ food for snacks or drinks (or just go downstairs to Whole Foods or Freshii or the food court). There's a small boutique in case you forgot your workout clothes. You can get your parking validated too. 

OTHER SERVICES: When you join, you get a free personal training session and one on one pilates reformer session. I thought both were fantastic, but I can't afford to pay for that stuff regularly on top of the membership fees! There is also a spa. I tried a massage there and it was great, but again, I would go elsewhere because the prices are really high. I think the only reason to go would be convenience if you are already here anyways. 

I would also mention that membership here includes some perks like special events every few months that might include free snacks/drinks/mini massages or pop up classes. For instance they hosted some outdoor classes at the Brickworks and Kasa Moto rooftop this summer, and meditation at Kit and Ace in the fall. 

Lastly, I was hesitant to join this gym initially because I thought it would be too scene-y. While in some ways it is predictably Yorkville (if you overhear some changeroom conversations it is very much #firstworldproblems and it is one of those gyms where people seem obssessed with wearing the latest in high end athleisure), this is a place where people are super committed to fitness and wellness (people are *intense* about their foam rolling and while I see people taking back to back classes and going HARD, the yin classes are also packed). I found it pretty motivating to be around these super ripped people, not to mention a few retired seniors who are there practically every day killing it! 

So overall, I would recommend Equinox for a certain type of gym goer. It just wasn't the best fit for me. Now lets see if I have any problems with my cancellation... (So many gyms are great until you try to cancel...)."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I went to Fresh Mint tonight for dinner with meetup.com's Vegetarian Society of Phoenix.  It was my first time, and I will definitely be going back.

Our party was over 20 people and the owners were very gracious.  Everyone seemed to like what they ordered.  I heard the Sweet and Sour soup was good.  Other favorites were the Kung Pao Soy ""Chicken"", Curry Apple Tofu, Vegetarian Black Pepper ""Steak"", Lemongrass Tofu, and the Golden Curry Vegetables with Tofu.

I had the Golden Curry with brown rice, and it was wonderful.  The sweet potatoes in it were a treat.  I thought the portions were good sized.  I have leftovers for tomorrow.

I was too full for dessert, but when I go back I will try something.  I'm already planning my next trip to Scottsdale!

Do not accept American Express.  Not a big deal for me, just wanted to mention it."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I came here by myself last week. Upon entering it smelled delicious. I was seated at a booth. The service was excellent. 

I did find the lighting in the place to be a bit distracting.  They had these almost like flood lights outdoor lighting in some of the areas. It felt too bright in the spots and made the restaurant seem industrial, not warm and inviting. 

As my usual I got chicken Tikka masala with garlic naan. I thought the chicken Tikka was too salty. The naan was OK seemed a little dry to me.  I also had a mango lassi which was delicious. 

Overall it seemed like a nice place and maybe there were other dishes that would be delicious, but chicken Tikka masala is my favorite and if I don't like it then I'm probably not coming back. Also the lighting situation really bugged me. Maybe they don't turn those bright lights on in the day time."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I had a good experience here.  I came in on a Saturday morning for some antibiotics.  A cat bit my hand at a place I was volunteering at, and I wanted to be on the safe side.  

Big, spacious waiting room.  I filled out my paperwork.  The man at the desk was friendly.  He seemed genuinely concerned that I feel better when I left.  Nice guy.

I did not think I had that long of a wait.  There were 3 people ahead of me.  Maybe it was 20 minutes.  I thought it was reasonable.  The practitioner was nice.  She prescribed my antibiotics.  I had the option to have them filled there for $15 which I took advantage of because I did not feel like making another stop.  I think I could have gotten them free with a Yelp check in coupon.  Oh well.  Hopefully I won't need to go back there soon, but I will use that coupon!

Overall, I was happy.  Close to my house.  It was good."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I don't get it. It sounds like it would be a great place with custom donuts, but I thought they tasted terrible. My mom and I tried four different donuts. The blueberry, the salted caramel, the cherry with chocolate chips, and maple. 

I liked that they were warm, but they were so greasy and they left a weird burnt taste in your mouth. I didn't like them at all and neither did my mom.  The blueberry tasted so artificial.  We ate a little of each doughnut and ended up throwing the rest away.

We ordered the donuts to go. The staff seemed friendly. I didn't like the vibe of the place. It seemed a little dirty, and felt kind of depressing.   I appreciate what they're trying to do, but like I said I just don't get it.  I don't know why this place is so highly rated. I prefer the type of donuts you get at Bosa.   These donuts are just over-the-top too much in my opinion.  Not my cup of tea."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"Great work!  I have never used a cleaning company before, we moved out of our rental house and needed it cleaned for the landlord to inspect. I called Kris, and left a message. She called me back and we set up the appointment to clean the house. 

I was in the process of still packing up the house and she was very encouraging. We had a really nice conversation and I could tell that I liked her right away. 

On the day of the cleaning, three women came to the house and I let them in. It took about three hours for them to clean, but it was a rather large house, and we really hadn't been keeping up on cleaning that well. The team did an excellent job!

In fact, while they were cleaning the landlord showed up and was very pleased. 

I'm excited to have found such a wonderful company!  Kris and her team do an exceptional job!  I am excited to schedule regular cleanings for my new house with Brennan & Co!"
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"Service is really good, but I'm not that impressed with their food.  I've had better sourdough bread and butter.  I hate that whipped butter, it seems fake to me.  The rolls are mass produced, boring, no character.  It's a chain, I get it.  I have a love of really good sourdough, and this doesn't cut it.

I had the prime rib and the au jus had too many herbs in it.  That was the first time I'd ever experienced it that way, and I didn't really care for it.  The meat was cooked well.  I asked for a baked potato with butter, sour cream, and chives.  No bacon.  It came out with bacon and no chives.  The quickly fixed it, so not really a huge deal, but then left the bacon potato on the table the rest of the dinner.  I don't really want to look at the potato with the bacon I didn't want for the rest of my meal.  

It's a fine restaurant for celebrations if you like to go to chains.  I prefer something more unique."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I still love the food at Pomegranate. It is by far some of the best vegan food around. That gets 5 stars from me. 

The service though really can be frustrating. I have been coming here a lot on the past year and service seems really hit or miss.  The food always brings me back, but I think the food saves them. Based on service I probably would have stopped coming. 

There seems to be a lot of confusion with the staff. Incorrect to go orders, bringing me my cheesecake to go while I'm waiting outside and telling me that the rest of my food is going to be 15 minutes. Can you imagine what 15 minutes outside waiting in 100 degrees will do to my dessert?  Um it's going to melt.  

Staff is trying, but not all of them seem like they have a clue. It comes off as too chill, too hippy dippy, not professional, and less than a 5 star worthy rating.  I want to see them take it up a notch and have the quality of service match the food."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I had the classic burger with no cheese and no pickles. Regular sized which I believe is 4 ounces of beef. It was a very good hamburger. My dad and I went there and ordered our food to go. 

Unfortunately the people who were working there we're not really quick with our to go order and it got kind of cold by the time we got home. I noticed the bags just sitting there and they weren't calling my name. 

My dad also got a classic burger which he enjoyed and we ordered an avocado club burger for my mom which she said was very good. 

We were not very impressed with the fries or the onion rings. Onion strings actually. They were very soggy and cold. None of us cared for the dipping sauce. 

I would say the hamburgers were a solid four stars, but combined with the slowness of the to go order and how are bags of food just sat there without anyone calling our names,  I have to give them three stars. 

I would go back, but I would dine in to avoid cold french fries and cold onion strings."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"More like 3.5 stars.

Things I liked:
Decor
Retro atmosphere
Cool round tables with nice seating
Scrambled eggs

Things that did not impress me:
The pancakes.  Now granted, I ordered just plain pancakes, but I have had some amazing plain pancakes in my time, and these were not.  Flat and overcooked.  The flavor was pretty good, but they were not fluffy buttermilk, yummy pancakes.  I know they have all the fancy options with a bunch of toppings, but if you can't get the plain ones to be outstanding, then you are not winning me over.

The hash brown cake.  It looked adorable, but I did not care for it.  I like my ratio of fried to not fried a little higher.  Soft in the the middle, not crispy.  Did not care for the flavor/seasoning on them either.  Just not my thing.

They did a nice job with customer service.  It was extremely busy and loud, but I expected that based on other reviews.

It's a cute place, but I think I will try other breakfast options that can make more impressive plain pancakes."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I was really excited to try Chez Vous.  My parents saw it featured on a AZ food show, so off we went for a weekend lunch.  I was not impressed.  Maybe it was an off day.  The service was nice, very Parisian, but it was a bit pushy.  The older woman who waited on us had so much perfume on that every time she came to the table I was overcome with the smell of it.  Not appetizing.  She was nice, but it was just too much.  I'm very sensitive to perfume, so too bad.

Another thing I didn't care for was that they were busing the table in the hallway near the bathrooms.  Dropping all the dishes in a tub.  It was really loud.  Just tossing plates and silverware in there made a tone of noise.  Really unappealing.  

Honestly I was not impressed with their crepes and neither were my parents.  I had some chicken creme thing, and it was bland to me.  Very boring.  We had a dessert crepe, and it was rubbery.  I just don't get the hype.  I think Crepe Bar does a better job with crepes, theirs are outstanding."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"A solid 4.5 stars.  This place is great!  I was really surprised at the location for such a nice restaurant.  In between an Ace Hardware and a video rental store, Barrelhouse is a much needed place for Chandler.  

I started with the cheese board.  It was very nice, but I wished it had included some crackers or small toasted bread.  The meal did come with some biscuits and honey butter that was excellent.

I had the sea bass, my fiancee had the flatiron steak, and my future stepson had the lobster mac and cheese.  My sea bass was good, but I preferred theirs.  Next time I will try a half order of the mac and cheese.

Their craft cocktails look great.  The bartender made my fiance a perfect old fashioned.

The server was very knowledgeable.  My only nit picky thing was that the booth that we sat in was next to a window, and that window had greasy hand prints on it.  Like a child had stood up in the booth and rubbed his or her hands all over the window.  Otherwise, a great place.  I will be going back!"
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"Came here for lunch with my mom last Sunday, and it was crowded.  I expected that!  They have a check in with your cell phone, so you can download an App that tells you your place in the line.  We were able to walk around and do some window shopping while we waited.

We were seated outside, which was a bit warm.  I am not happy with this early heat!  It was only February.  Someone came and got our drink order right away.  Then someone came with a scone, but we did not order a scone.  He walked away so quickly that we did not have a chance to tell him that we thought it was a mistake.  Our server came and yes indeed they had delivered it to the wrong table.  It was for the women next to us.  Tiny bit awkward, but we did not touch it, so I guess that was fine.

My mom and I split the bruschetta.  Apple and fig, white bean and tomato, smoked salmon, and warm artichoke.  We really liked the white bean, but all were excellent!

No room for dessert!  I would come back, but expect a wait, especially on a Sunday at lunch time!"
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"We decided to try out Bar Vinedo last night. It is cute and very wine-bar-ish. Dark lighting, little nooks with couches, eclectic lamps, some high top tables.  We sat in one of the nooks with the couch.  Unfortunately that couch was incredibly uncomfortable!  Time to upgrade!

We started with the lamb sliders.  I am not a huge lamb fan, but these were excellent!  Highly recommend!

I had the grilled cheese (without the prosciutto) and the tomato soup.  Excellent grilled cheese.  Beautiful presentation with the soup, but I did not care for the flavor.  

My fiance had the pork with Brussels sprouts and scalloped potatoes.  He said it was excellent.

We were there on a live music night.  Not really in to the live music, but if you like that kind of thing, the band was there.  I prefer a quieter meal.

Service was ok.  Servers kept bringing our food and not bringing utensils.  

The 4 stars is based on food.  Service and ambiance (loud music that night) would be a 3.

I will go back to try more meals, just not on live music night!"
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I wanted to absolutely love this place, but it was okay. I like the concept and all the options that you can choose from.  It just did not wow me. I had the vegetarian sandwich and it was just okay. Maybe there are other sandwiches with me or different sauces would've been better. 

It's worth trying again I suppose. I did like that you can order online, but when I got there my order I didn't feel like they were helpful with telling me what I needed to do to get my food. I waited for the pick up was and the young man making sandwiches didn't acknowledge me. So I waited until I realized that my food was probably just back there ready to be picked up. I had to get his attention and ask him if they had my sandwich ready at first he couldn't find it but finally figured out it was hanging on the hook behind him. 

Not a huge deal but the reason I order online so it's ready and I can pick it up quickly, I have an hour for lunch, and I tried to avoid extra wait time. 

So I will probably go back and try a different combination of things on my sandwich."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I've been here several times, and I purchased a membership. I wish I hadn't. The facials are nice, but they really push for you to buy the products. I'm relaxed afterwards, I don't want to hear what I need to buy.  Just ask me if I'm interested in purchasing anything and leave it at that.

I was there yesterday for a facial and a pedicure.  After my facial, they had me wait in the ""Quiet Room.""  Either they forgot about me or the woman who was supposed to do my pedicure was really late, but I had to go and let them know that I was waiting 10 minutes after my appointment was supposed to start.  

Ok it happens, but the woman who was to give my pedicure was clearly in a bad mood.  She just looked at me, and said very defeatedly, ""I'm running so late.""  That was it!  Not hey thanks for waiting, or welcome, or hi how are you?  It really wasn't cool.  I don't think they told her I was waiting, so I kinda felt bad for her, but her energy was so negative that I just decided that I was over it.  

It just really left a bad impression.  I'm going to cancel my membership as soon as possible!"
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"Wow!  I love Hillstone!  Came here on a Saturday night and we made sure we had a reservation.  It was packed!  Even with the reservation, we waited 20 minutes.  I did not care.  I know what the food is like.  It's worth it.

We had the salmon appetizer.  Outstanding!  I had the salmon entree for dinner, and it was excellent as well. My fiance had the Caesar salad.  Oh. My. God.  That salad was one of the best Caesars we had ever had.  I wish that I had ordered one, but I was getting full.  He had it with the fried oysters.  Not really my thing, but he loved it.  I must eat that Caesar salad again!  Mine will be without fried oysters.  :-)

For dessert I ordered the ice cream sundae.  It looked interesting to me.  I saw someone else with it, and it had a good sized gravy boat of hot fudge.  I wanted to try it.  I like ice cream, but it is not my ""ride or die"" as they say.  This one might be.  Homemade vanilla ice cream, and chocolate syrup/fudge with the richest whipped cream I have ever eaten.  My first bite was incredible.  I could not believe that it tasted so good.  I was completely blown away by it.  If all ice cream tasted like that then I get it.

Great night!  Great food.  I wish it was closer to Gilbert.  I cannot wait to go back!"
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"Like many people, my cats are my babies. Didier is 15, and I have had him since he was a tiny kitten.  As you can imagine, I am very particular about who his doctor is. 

I saw an ad for Animal Medical Center of Chandler, and it said they were American Animal Hospital Association certified, and cat friendly. I took Didier there, and we met with Dr. Duregger. I was immediately impressed with her bedside manner. Didier is normally very friendly, but vet trips terrify him. Dr. Duregger was calming, quiet, and very skilled at putting Didier at ease.  Well as much as that is possible. You can tell when someone knows how to approach a frightened cat. 

Didier went back a few weeks later for a teeth cleaning. He needed three teeth pulled. I am a nervous mother when it comes to that. I had another cat pass away from complications after that kind of procedure. It's always a risk, especially with older cats. 

Dr. Duregger took time to explain to me all the precautions they take while their patients are under. They monitor blood pressure and some places do not. 

Needless to say, Didier has mostly recovered, his surgery was last week. You can tell he feels better!

Great customer service, caring staff. They even have a separate room just for cats while they await and recover from procedures. Highly recommend!"
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"The first time my fiancé and I came here it was for a nut milk class. We tried different types of nut milks and vegan nut cheeses. They even gave us samples of their bread. I was impressed and wanted to come back and try more food. 

Since the class I have been back twice. I have only tried the kale salad, the nutty butter sandwich, a date bar, the hummus plate, and a vanilla bean latte. 

The vanilla bean latte is excellent!  I absolutely love it with coconut milk.  
The kale salad was good. It was fresh and healthy but I prefer a different kale salad from another restaurant. The nutty butter sandwich was nice as well but the day that I tried it they had run out of banana. It was good but would've been better with the banana. The hummus plate had really nice fresh vegetables to dip the hummus in, and three different kinds of hummus. I liked it but I think the hummus could have been seasoned a little more. It was a bit bland for my taste.  I did not really care for the date bar. I appreciate that it was vegan and gluten-free, but the dates were very mushy and I did not like the texture. I would also like a little more flavoring in that as well.  Maybe more cinnamon or something to give it a little extra excitement. 

I'm grateful there is another solid quality vegan gluten-free restaurant in the valley."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I was so excited to try out Crepe Bar!  I went on a Sunday around noon. It was busy and a bit loud, but I expected that. 

The staff was very friendly and helpful. They let me know that it would be about 20 minutes for my food. That was fine.  Sometimes amazing food is worth waiting for. 

I got an iced latte, and it was one of the best I've had.  I also got the pesto chicken and a ""first time"" crepe (Nutella and banana brûlée).

The wait was a little longer, but one of the servers brought out a bacon scone for me to snack on. Not a big fan of bacon in scones, but they get points for noticing that I had been waiting. It's that attention to detail that makes me a loyal customer. 

The pesto chicken was awesome!  I think I prefer my crepes sweet though so next time I will stick with a dessert crepe, but it was delicious.

The ""first time"" was incredible!  I had the server box up it up after a few bites. Otherwise I would have eaten the whole thing and been ill. :-)

Before I left, one of the servers let me know that he would be brining out something to try if I had time to stick around.  He brought out a mini mascarpone cheesecake-like thing with whipped cream and granola on it.  Wow!  Rich and delicious.  Apparently they serve those only for dinner on Friday and Saturday nights.

Go there with an appetite!  It was excellent!"
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"The place was open, lots of seating.  Looked clean.  On the downside the music was blaring.  Why do these places insist on having such loud music?  I'm coming here after work.  I want to eat in peace.  Perhaps now that I am 43, I am an old fart, but really I just want to eat without music blaring.

The young adults working seemed to be in training.  Some of them appeared confused.  I did not see any paper menus around.  That is easier than staring up at a board.  I cannot imagine getting through the line at lunch in an organized manor.  Thank God it was not busy at 5pm.

I got an enchilada.  The tortilla was good and seemed pretty fresh.  Was not that impressed with the green sauce though.  They gave me a ton of beans which was good.  Guac is extra.  Yes, guac is always extra.  It was ok, needed more salt and lime, in my opinion.  The honey habanero salsa was awesome!  I really loved that stuff!  My favorite part of the meal.  So if the salsa is the best part of the meal.......I need to try a different meal I guess.

I like how everything is served in a potential take out container and that the lids are out where you can get them without having to get back in line.

I will try it again, but it seemed confusing to order.  Hopefully next time will be better.  I do think that it might be a huge cluster if I go for lunch though."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I think the quality has decreased in the last three years. My fiancé and I ate dinner here the other night and we felt like for the price, we did not experience an outstanding meal. 

For example the butter that they bring with the bread is not real butter. It's that with stuff that seems to have some type of canola oil added to it. The texture of the bread was nice but it's not sourdough and really didn't have much flavor. 

I asked for with a salad with dressing on the side it came on the top. They fixed it but again attention to detail when I'm spending $28 for meal is important. 

They made my fiancé old-fashioned incorrectly.   They were able to fix it but it still didn't taste right. I think they added simple syrup. It  had a strange sweet flavor to it. 

My fiancé did enjoy his meal they cooked a steak the way he wanted it and they left off the butter on his vegetables because he has a dairy allergy so that was good. 

My steak however was well done and I did not ask for it well done. The flavoring and seasoning was good though. 

Again for the amount of money we paid for that meal it definitely was not worth it. In my opinion the keg is just another one of those chain restaurants that charges a lot of money pretending to be a fancy restaurant and it's just average. There are many other options out there for a nice steak dinner where attention to detail is important."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I have been excited to go and check this place out. I stopped one morning before work for a breakfast burrito. I ordered the egg and Barbacoa burrito, no bacon. I must say the quality of ingredients was excellent!  Several people at work commented on how good my office smelled while I was eating it that morning. 

I returned several days later in the evening to pick up a quick dinner. I got bean and cheese burritos for my fiancé's son, and I bought a carne asada and a Barbacoa to try. My fiancé's son said the bean and cheese was OK he prefers Los Favs. He thought the portion was too small. I preferred the Carne Asada. The steak was seasoned very well!  The Barbacoa was good but it really was just meat and nothing else. The other my other burrito was just meat as well, but I liked it better. 

My fiancé has celiac so he cannot eat any gluten. Unfortunately they only have flour tortilla's. I asked them if they did a corn but they do not. 

Overall I think the quality of ingredients is a four star. I do agree with other posters that the sizes could be a bit bigger. The price is good though, but do not expect a giant burrito. 

I also think that it would be nice to have some other items inside the burrito. I wish they would let us choose which things we could have put in it.  Mix it up a little bit and have some pico or cheese. I also wish they would consider making corn tortillas as well."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"My husband and I ate here last night for the first time, and we will never go back.  We didn't know that it is really only a place for drinking, not eating.

The chips were greasy and all broken in small pieces.  The salsa was not anything I would want to eat again.  My husband ordered the tortilla soup and he said it was ok.  I ordered the fish tacos and took one bite.  It didn't taste right.  My husband tried one bite and had to spit it in to his napkin.  They were bad.  Spoiled or something.  My side of sour cream was warmish, not cold.  My husband tried his chili cornbread and it was burned, greasy, and not cooked through in the middle.  I had ordered a side of guacamole and it was overly salty and did not taste fresh or right either.  

I noticed that there was a prep area near the edge of the restaurant where waitresses cut avocados and scooped them out.  Bottles of their ""salsa"" were left out and not returned to the tubs of ice, where I assume they were supposed to go.  It did not look clean or well maintained.  Vile!

We told the waitress that the fish tacos were bad and they did take it off our bill, but to be honest they could have taken everything off the bill.  Nothing was worth paying for!  No wait, my husband had a margarita and he said it was pretty good.  So that's it.  I guess the Salty Senorita is a loud  annoying place to have a good margarita and a decent bowl of tortilla soup."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"This review is based on our experience walking in to discuss membership options.  

Very hard sell from the man who spoke with us.  Kept asking, ""what are you looking for in a gym?"" ""what are your goals?""  He acted like he was trying to be our therapist and figure out what we were doing with our lives and exercise.  Dude, I just want prices.  Bottom line it for me.  I wish I said that.

When we did not seem interested, ""what do we not have that you are looking for?""  ""What are you looking for in a gym that you are not seeing here?""  He went on and on.  Finally gave us prices, and when we still seemed unconvinced, he tried a new tactic of challenging some of my fiance's previous answers about how long we had been thinking about a membership.  Sigh.  So annoying.  It was like he was trying to bully us at that point.  Would not let us take the price sheet that he had written on.  Oh poor us.  I guess we missed out!  Not!

I am looking for a gym that does not pressure me in to membership.
My goal is to gather information about prices and not be pressured in to something.

Fastest way to turn me off is this hard sell nonsense.  Does this really work on people?  I am used to working out at Community Colleges.  Register for it like a class, pay the tuition, show up and work out.  Very simple.  I guess I am not complicated enough for a membership at this LA Fitness.

I would never sign up here.  Too much drama just to get a membership."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"The four stars is based on my food today.  I would give it 2.5 for ambiance.

Cafe Zupa is very close to my work, and I have been meaning to check it out.  
When you walk up to the doors you can hear the music blaring out on the patio.  Never really been a fan of loud music for lunch places, or any other for that matter.

I entered and there is a counter where you are greeted.  They have paper menus available, and I like that.  I had the vegetarian sandwich and the lobster bisque.  I really like that they let you try a little bit of soup if you would like a sample.  I tried the tomato basil and the lobster bisque.  I ended up with the bisque, but wished I chose the tomato.  The bisque was good, but I think the tomato would have agreed with me more.  

The vegetarian sandwich was excellent!  The bread was soft, loved the flavor of the pesto sauce.  Overall very nice.  

I also ordered some marshmallow chocolate bar thing for dessert.  It was good, not sure I would get again, but good.

Overall service was friendly, although when I approached the counter after my meal for a bag to put my leftovers in, the girl said, ""A bag.......??""  Like I was asking for something so completely foreign to her, and as if I was really bothering her.  Oh teen, twenty something counter help.....sigh.  Sorry to bother you while you are standing at the register.  How dare I ask for a bag!

The downside:
It was very loud in there.  I need a place to relax on my lunch break, and the music was blaring.  The lights in there are like floodlights.  Depending where you sit, you might have a spotlight in your face.

I enjoyed the sandwich and the sample of tomato basil enough to return.  I would like to try a salad next time!  Bring earplugs! ;-)"
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"My mom and I came here for breakfast on Veterans Day. We had about a 30 minute wait which was to be expected. They have a lot of seating for people who are waiting for a table. 

When we did get our table it was probably one of the worst ones in the restaurant right in the flow of traffic. I asked the waitress if we could please have a booth which they did find us one. That was nice. It was very busy and quite loud in there. I'm not complaining about it I would just be warned if you're someone who prefers a more quiet restaurant. Also it was Veterans Day so it was like I said, really busy.

My mom and I both ordered a cup of coffee. It was pretty good I still prefer Crepe Bar's coffee. My mom also ordered the fresh orange juice. That was excellent!  They even give you a free refill. It is a bit pricey however. 

My mom ordered the French toast with scrambled egg and sausage. She like the French toast, but I didn't care for it.  it was deep-fried I found it to be way too heavy and very greasy just wasn't my style. My mom said the sausage was good I didn't try it.  We both agreed that the scrambled egg was delicious!  I really like how they prepared the egg. I could've gotten some more eggs but I was already getting full. 

I ordered the blueberry pancakes. They were very good.  I do like the little hint of lemon in them. I thought they could've had a little bit more blueberries though. We both payed the extra dollar to have the real maple syrup. 

Overall this is a good breakfast place. It's hard to come here and not over order. I left feeling way too full. I think I am just not a fan of big heavy breakfasts, but I do appreciate this place and their quality. I would go back for the scrambled eggs, and those cinnamon rolls looked really good!"
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I first ate at the Salt Cellar as a child with my parents.  I have a nice memory of having lobster.  It was fun to go to a restaurant underground, and at the time (in the 80's) it was considered a really fancy place to go.  

So that was the 80's and unfortunately, Salt Cellar is stuck in the 80's.  It still was kinda cool going down the stairs to the restaurant, but it felt like the air wasn't clean.  Seemed dank.  The bar looked nice, but the lighting in the restaurant were those weird orange ones.  Mood lighting?  Seemed depressing and old.  The pictures on the wall looked like were the same ones that were there in the 70's.  This place needs a make over!!!

We were seated and they took my fiance's drink order.  He was very clear about no water in his old fashioned.  It was served with water.  He sent it back, and it came back the same way.  Finally he just ordered straight bourbon. 

My fiancé had oysters and I had halibut ceviche. The oysters were gritty. The ceviche had a very sour taste and was loaded with red peppers. I think they used lemon instead of lime.  I couldn't finish it. Nasty!

Main course I had the Salmon Oscar. The salmon was amazing, but it was ruined from being drowned in a very bad hollandaise. It tasted like glue. No lemon flavor. It was just bad!  I squeezed some lemon on it to try to fix it, but it was not working. Too much sauce and it was just awful!

My fiancé ordered halibut cheeks that were pretty good, but the vegetables were so over cooked and drowned in butter. The baked potato was decent. 

I felt sick from the nasty hollandaise so we got the check and left. Disappointing!

Salt Cellar is stuck in the past and in need of a makeover.  I was afraid of this, but went for nostalgic reasons.  Too bad. We won't be back!"
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"I went there last week for a mammogram. The woman at the front desk was pretty friendly and had good customer service. For some reason though the waiting area just seems over crowded and depressing. They tried to decorate it and make it look nice but for some reason it just doesn't seem very inviting. 

My lack of stars and is mostly based of the technician that did my mammogram. Granted I know this is not a pleasant procedure however if you're going to smash my boobs in the machine you could at least be compassionate about it. Instead when I spoke up and said that it really hurt much more then any other mammogram I've had before, she gave me an attitude like, well that's just the way it is, too bad for you. She didn't do the other side as hard as she did the right side. My breast felt like it had been bruised, and it was very uncomfortable. Show a little compassion and tell me it's going to be over soon something to help people cope. She just acted like she could care less. 

Then when I was finished she asked me for the doctors order. I had put it in my purse and I got it out of my purse and gave it to her. She seemed very annoyed and said ""well this is for a diagnostic I just did a screening.""  I said well what am I supposed to do about that. It's not my fault that she asked me after she had done test to see what the doctor wanted. I was busy getting changed and didn't even think of giving her the doctors order right away. Shouldn't they have asked for that at the reception desk?  

Anyway she seemed annoyed and said she would have to call my doctors office. I have no idea how that's going to work out for them, but hopefully it won't cause me any extra problems. 

I prefer to go somewhere else that specializes in mammograms where the technicians are more compassionate. Skip this place if you can."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"Ok you know when you go somewhere by yourself, and you feel like you get ignored because you are a party of one?  I get that once in a while when dining out, and it is very frustrating.  I actually think this was a combo of that plus something seemed to be wrong with the waiter.  Not sure what it was, but he seemed out of it, confused, new, distracted.  Take your pick.

It was a Saturday night around 7pm, and I stopped in for some fried chicken and a waffle.  I have eaten at the Scottsdale location several times a few years ago and always enjoyed it.  They seated me at kinda a crappy table for two.  I asked to move to a booth.  It was not that busy, so I figured why do I have to sit at the crappy table just because I'm alone?

Waiter came over after what seemed like a longer time than necessary, and did one of those sit down with me on the booth.  Ugh!  I do not like that.  It just feels so invasive to me.  He's like trying to be my best buddy, and I'm not in the mood for all that drama, just take my order.  He's all, ""so what are you doing tonight?""  Trying to eat in peace.  I feel like my body language gives off the vibe sometimes that I do not want to be bothered.  Let's keep is short and sweet, do not sit next to me.  He was not picking up my vibe.  I order water to drink and the Tre Tre.

He disappeared!  It took 13 minutes for someone else to walk by and notice my now pissed off vibe.  I still had no water.  That is ridiculous!  They were not busy!
The other waitress got my water, and the couple next to me said that they had also been waiting a long time for things.  A party in a booth in another section who arrived after me had their drinks right away.  

I tell the waitress that I am done, and I would like my food to go.  I also want my bill.  I just want out of there.

Waiter finally comes by with a ton of apologies, and my check, but he leaves quickly.  I get out my card to pay, and he has disappeared.  I'm still waiting.  I finally get up and go to the front and say I'm done I want to pay.  The hostess says you have to pay your server.  I say well my server is no where to be found and I am ready to go.  

They charge my card and give me my food to go.  The fried chicken was not even as good as I remember it.  Overall very diappointing.  I would not go back."
r9tjKaqLvLKF7PvDnUsFnA,"My mother and I came here on Saturday afternoon a few weeks ago thinking that we were going to experience great customer service with a bra fitting.  Obviously based on my one star, we did not. 

We were greeted by a single employee working in the store. She was young and it seemed pretty obvious that she didn't really know what she was doing.  I asked her about a bra fitting so she had me come in the back and measured me with a tape measure. First of all it felt like she was cutting off my circulation when she went around my chest. 

Secondly when she determined my size, it seemed as if she was unable to help me find any bras in the store that were my supposed size. 

She tried to explain that there's something about the computer that they were unable to keep track of what sizes they had. I could not really figure out what she was talking about. You've told me what size I need now help me find a bra that's that size seems pretty simple to me!  Instead she proceeded to just sort of stand there and not even help me on my mom look for the correct size bra. 

She went around showing me all the different types of bras and explaining that she didn't know what sizes they were or if they had my size. Also that they really carried more variety for large sizes and since I am on the smaller side she didn't think they would have many that would fit me. 

At this point I was very confused how am I supposed to find the bra that I want since she wasn't looking for any size for me. She was still just sort of standing around. 

My mother did more work at trying to find the correct bra size for me than she did!  So we did find a bra that was the size that this salesgirl said I was.  I tried it on and it was so tight that I could hardly stand it. 

I tried to be patient and give her a chance but this was just ridiculous my mother and I left the bras and left the store.  The girl was still just standing around like she didn't know what to do. 

So my question is. The shop is very small, how can you be in there and not have some understanding of what bras you have and how you have them organized?  Was she just filling in for someone and really didn't know what she was doing? Or is this their idea of running a good store?  I doubt I will ever find out because I will not go back. 

I will have better luck figuring out what bra size I should wear by trying on a bunch of different ones at Kohl's.  At least they have a better selection and they're in order and you can figure out what size you need and where they are!"
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Located in a strip mall. Manager is pleasant. Owners were working hard in the open kitchen during a light lunch rush. Decor is modern with several tables if you want to dine in. Pick Two $14 comes with 2 sides. Pick Three $16 comes with 2 sides. Each additional side is $2 and they come in 4oz? containers. They also have sandwich combos with one side or 1/2lbs of meat and 2 sides. I would say the portions sizes and prices are reasonable and roughly in-line with places like Mission BBQ, Proper Pig, and Woodstock. 

Pulled Pork - Excellent. Moist, tender and I enjoyed the BBQ sauce with it. Good even when reheated the next day! 

Beef Brisket - Moist and tender. Served in two long slices. Would have been great if it was not 2/3 fat. I mean, fat adds flavor, but this was just way too much. Just need to trim up their slices and it would be perfect. 

Ribs - Tender, pulled off the bone easily, but not my favorite. 

Kielbasa - Seemed okay, I don't care for kielbasa in general so no opinion on this. 

Burnt Ends - I was expecting burnt ends like how Oak and Embers serves them, these leaned more towards little chunks of jerky. Not bad, but I would not get them again. 

Coleslaw - Nice crunch. Has a taste of citrus to it. Really enjoyed this, and was disappointed that they only filled the container up half way. 

Bread Pudding - Really enjoyed this even without the raisins. Very tasty!

Mac & Cheese - Great idea, not executed well enough though. It's saucy and has a crushed cracker topping but the cheese they use is bright orange and if I had to guess it's the kind you find in a bag at the convenience store that you pump into a tray for pretzels or nachos. 

Cheesy Grits - Okay, but unfortunately they used that fake cheese sauce again. 

Baked Beans - Not bad, but nothing special about these. 

BBQ Sauce - Regular or Spicy. Nothing too crazy so don't expect potent smokey, sweet, vinegar, whatever notes. It's pretty simple but works well! 

Cookie $1 - Normal sized and actually a really good chocolate chip cookie but super dry burnt ends that are baked into it did not work. Would not buy again unless they take out the burnt ends. 

I was torn between a 3 and 4 star rating for Ribsticks. The texture of their pulled pork and brisket is perfect, but there is not a lot of flavor to it so don't expect to see much of a rub or smoke ring on the meats. Just add some of their BBQ sauce though and you'll be fine. I was happy to see that they did not over price their sides and I really enjoyed the coleslaw and bread pudding a lot. If they could make their cheese sauce from scratch I think that would make their mac & cheese phenomenal. Kick up their baked beans a notch with some more flavor and they would be really great too. I was told they were working on making corn bread which is something I always love to see at BBQ places. 

Overall I think they have a pretty good start to things in the BBQ world. They are new so they do have some tweaking to do if they really want to rank high amongst their competitors, but I would definitely give them another try!"
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Let me tell you a story about buying a car...

I was driving the same car for the last 12 years, like I had this car since high school! She did her best and while I had separation anxiety, I knew it was finally time for me to upgrade. I decided I wanted a Mazda 3 Hatchback. I took my time and spent the last two years researching: asking questions, talking to owners, reading reviews, and meeting with dealerships. I wasn't that happy with the sales people I encountered previously so I gave up on my new car search for a while. I don't like making an inquiry and then receiving multiple texts, calls, emails right away (within an  hour!) from one place, I didn't like being transferred between sales associates, or talking with associates who had very little experience and knowledge about the car they were selling. I also don't like getting the run around about pricing and having to go back and forth (""here's the price, well we can try to lower it this much, hey wait! how about this much?"" Psshh if you wanted to give me a fair deal you would have done that from the start!). All of this typical reasons for why car sales people earn their bad reputation. 

I found none of that malarkey at Brunswick Mazda/ Brunswick Auto Mart! In 24 hours of making contact with them I purchased a new car! Ryan Hart was my sales associate and he promptly contacted me and gave me the lowest price from the start. No BS, no games, just straight forward and in talking to him I could easily tell he had a lot of knowledge not only about my specific car but about the manufacturer in general as well. And you better believe I grilled him and brought up every problem, possibility, question, whatever that I found in my research. He stayed cool as a cucumber and gave me all of the answers. He went over every single doohickey and feature inside and outside of the car with me and we discussed/compared everything (ie 16 inch tires vs 18 inch tires and how the car performs in the snow). He even broke down the pricing for me so I could see exactly how everything added up and what payments would be if I took 0% APR or cash back. He was very open about all of the rebates I could get, what if anything he made off of the sale, what the dealership was getting, how long the car was on the lot, if Mazda was going to do any revisions on this model soon, the three best times of the year to buy a car, his history/driving experience with his own Mazda; he was upfront about everything!

When it came time for the paper work I met with the finance manager, Steven Platko. Another seemingly genuine guy, friendly, and no stench of shadiness at all. I had a specific number in mind that I wanted for my car payments and Steve found a way to help me get really close to that ideal goal. The sales price could not be lowered anymore so they increased the value of my trade and bought me three more months of zero interest. 

All in all I would definitely recommend Ryan and Steve at Brunswick Mazda. I felt comfortable, did not experience any pressure or stupid sales tactics, and I know I got a really great deal on my car!"
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"I thought this place was called Cleveland Axe Throwing, but I think they changed their name to Class Axe Throwing?

I found a Groupon for 4 people to try axe throwing for 90 minutes for $95.95, but then you have to go schedule your date/time on the website and pay an extra $20.72 for taxes and fees? I really hate that. Just give me one price don't say it's one thing then slip in extra charges. So anyway it came out to $29.17 a person. 

Day of we show up and find out that the 4 of us will be sharing a lane with 7 other people. I think they do up to 12 per lane. There are 3 lanes. Not a problem, we just split into two groups and everyone got along. 

So throwing axes is pretty fun, especially when you compete against others with fun games like first team to 40, or who can spell Timber first, or best throws out of 10. But before the fun starts you'll spend about an hour learning the rules and axe throwing techniques (two handed overhead, one handed) - hitting the bullseye on a large target is definitely not as easy as you first think. After the training bit is over you get about 30 minutes of actual play time. In our case we were the last group of the night so our time went over a little bit which I appreciated them allowing. A good thing though is that if everyone in the entire group has already done axe throwing they will shorten the training period next time you come in so that you have more play time. Also, I liked the music they were playing. 

A big negative for me though was the lack of A/C on a hot humid July night. They had a garage door open and a couple wall fans but that barely helped. If you're a person who heats up easily like me then I would not recommend coming here during the summer. Stick with cooler weather unless you like damp clothing and smelling sweaty bodies. 

Another issue I had was with picture taking. Actually, my issue is with the lady who gave me a hard time when I asked if they would not take my picture. I get it, you want to promote your business and share pictures of people throwing axes at your establishment on Facebook. I know lots of people don't care and will model for you all you want. Me though, I like pictures of myself to stay as personal/private as possible. Big group picture? No problem, I will be in the back, but I don't want singled out pictures of me for strangers all over the interwebs to look at. I get that I signed a waiver in order to do this axe throwing activity, but can't you respect my wishes and not photograph me? I did not care for this lady, but the guy instructing our group was great and had no problem not snapping shots of me. He was a lot more chill and understanding. 

So all in all, I think new experiences are great so I would suggest this to everyone, just hopefully my review prepares you better for what you're getting into. I would try it again in the winter. Also note that you need to sign the waiver electronically in advance and that alcohol is allowed but for private parties only and it's BYOB. I do wonder what they do with all of the wooden boards that get hacked up? Seemed like they replace them every day."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"With all of the glowing 5 star reviews, this one is going to be a punch to the gut. Sorry folks. 

Walking in I was greeted warmly by a woman who is the wife of one of the owners. She told me that her husband and his buddies decided to open up a BBQ joint and while right now they are listed as a deli type place, they will eventually have a sit down restaurant once they finish renovations. She answered all of my questions, was patient with me while I made my choices, and I was even offered up a sample of their ribs. Only negative was that there was no trash can in the front or napkins readily available so I had to hand her my chewed up rib bone and ask for napkins to clean up with. 

I went with 2 meats and 2 sides for $18, 1/2 rack of ribs for $10, and an extra side for $3. I think the prices are a bit high especially with the sides coming in those 4oz plastic sauce containers. To give some perspective fancy Mabel's in downtown Cleveland charges $13 for 1/2 lbs of brisket and $6 for a side big enough for two people. Proper Pig in Lakewood charges $16 for 3 meats and 2 sides, with the sides being of generous portions like Mabel's. I expect to pay high prices downtown, but not in Parma. If I am going to be paying more, I want the quality to be better than most and the portion sizes to be bigger than half a cup. 

-Ribs. Great flavor, but lacking texture wise. I like my ribs with an almost crispy caramelized bark (or a nice peppered rub) and the meat to be moist and juicy. Easily tears all off of the bone. These ribs were pretty firm, could not easily rip them apart, and BBQ sauce was needed due to lack of moisture. 
-Fatty brisket. Nice little layer of fat on the meat, not too much, but just enough to enhance the flavor. Can also see a nice little smoke line. Texture however is on the firm side. Meat was closer to dry than moist. Does not melt in your mouth. 
-Pulled pork. This had the best texture out of all the meats we tried. Cooked perfectly. Not dried out at all. Enjoyed the mustardy BBQ sauce on this. 
-Slice of white bread. Like that this comes from a local bakery, On The Rise. (Would prefer cornbread, but no points docked here).
-Baked Beans. Very tasty! Out of everything we tasted, this was the only thing my dining companion said they liked. 
-Coleslaw. A-OK, seemed to have a little bit of a kick to it. 
-Mac & cheese. I was disappointed with this. This was cheese sauce over elbow pasta and was pretty mediocre. I prefer my mac & cheese to be of the thick, creamy, covered in sauce, stick to your ribs variety.  

To summarize, great customer service, pricier than you would expect, small sides, food has potential and would be great if they tweaked a few things (get that meat juicy!). I would give them a second try. They are new, so maybe I just came in on an off day. 

There are a lot of BBQ places that have opened up or are soon to be open: Gorilla, Proper Pig, Woodstock, Mabel's, Rib Sticks, Mission BBQ, Crooked River BBQ, (this does not count the established or chain BBQ places), so Barabicu has some competition and needs to be on top of their game if they want to survive."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"So it's Restaurant Week and that just gives me another excuse to meet up with my foodie friends and grab a bite to eat. A fellow Yelper had never been to Hodge's before so we decided to meet up here since you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert for $30 during RW. We showed up early so we could sit at the bar and check out their happy hour menu and started out with some $3 beers and $5 specialty cocktails then added a couple $3-$6 small plates:

-Duck Confit Flatbread: OMG DELICIOUS! I didn't want to share, but I did. One slice.
-Snack Trio: You get one deviled egg which was nothing special, one hankie pankie which is this yummy meat and cheese concoction spread on a crostini, and one devil on horseback which is a bacon wrapped stuffed date which was okay.
-Side of Mac & Cheese: My friend got this and really enjoyed how the figs added a nice touch of sweetness to the dish.  

Later on after we closed out our bar tab we were seated upstairs for dinner. The upstairs is small intimate space overlooking the restaurant below. They have cool artwork on the walls of dictionary pages with screen prints of animals on them. It was 78 degrees up there per the thermostat though, so wear layers you can take off unless you're like my friend who loves it that toasty. Now for the food:

-Cup of Creamy Beer Cheese Soup: Missing the chives, but very good. Perfect balance of beer and cheese that I think would go great over a baked potato or even as a sauce for a pasta dish. 
-Cornbread: Yum! Buttery and slightly sweet with the perfect texture. You could eat it with or without butter or crumble it into your soup. 
-Ohio Chicken: This was my friend's dish, but I tasted it as well and we were both disappointed. The portion was huge, but everything was without flavor and they didn't even eat it. I think it would have been better if they had seasoned the chicken and had a gravy with it instead of the broth it came in. 
-Bay of Fundy Salmon: Looked great, but unfortunately this dish was also disappointing. The fried rice was good, but the salmon was plain and dry. I asked for a side of sauce, but that didn't work either and the dish went uneaten. 
-Chocolate Chip Skillet Cookie: The crust on this was great, nice and crispy. The inside was warm and gooey, but very loaded with chocolate, like a little too much even for me. Cookie went well with the Mitchell's ice cream though and the couple bites I had I enjoyed. Probably would have been better to share unless you're into diabetic comas. 

Management noticed we didn't enjoy our entrees and listened to our remarks when they asked us about our meal. I really appreciate a business that takes the time to see how their guests are enjoying their experience and does what they can to make that experience as best as it can be. They ended up taking financial responsibility for our dinner which was completely unexpected, but such a customer service friendly move that there is no way I can give this place low stars. 

All in all, my friend and I both agreed that we would definitely come back to Hodge's since the small plates and appetizers were great, we'll just stay at the bar next time."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Stopped in a Sunday evening to get a sampling of BBQ to enjoy the next couple of days (I ate this for 3 days!). The parking lot was packed, but my wait was super short. I think the longest part was me deciding what to get. Young lady at the register was friendly and patient. The woman who gave me my order was friendly and opened up all of the boxes to explain what they were and make sure everything was in there. She also gave me samples of all of their sauces. 

-Brisket Sandwich $8.29. Lots of meat! I'd guess half a pound? Meat was chopped up, moist and tender, kinda made me think I was eating pot roast, but it was really good. I would get this again! 
-Pulled Pork Pick Two Meat Sampler $8.99. Good. Moist. 1/4lbs or 4oz
-Pulled Chicken Pick Two Meat Sampler $8.99. Good. Moist. 1/4lbs or 4oz
-Baby Back Ribs $2.39 each bone. Ordered two bones and received a bigger portion size than expected. Meat was moist and definitely fell off the bone, but to me that is over cooked. Rib meat should easily pull off the bone, not fall into pieces as you try to pick up a rib. Also, to me this tasted extremely salty. Like I was shocked at how salty the meat was. 
-Spare Ribs $2.19 each bone. Ordered two bones and received a bigger portion size than expected. Meat was firmer than the baby back ribs and while still a little salty, not as as bad as the baby backs. 
-Baked Beans with Brisket $2.04. A-Okay, but the first night I munched on this it tasted really fatty to me. Next day it was fine so IDK what was up with that. 
-Coleslaw $1.89. Much needed light and refreshing side. Nothing special, but satisfying. 
-Cheesy Potatoes $2.14. Just added some black pepper and it was freaking delicious! Very hearty so it helped to split it and not eat it all in one sitting. 
-Mac & Cheese $2.09. Good, but does lean towards the mac & cheese you find in a crockpot at a family get together. Again, not bad at all, not dried out or anything, I just prefer a creamy cheese sauce. Still a nice comfort food side.
-Cornbread 79¢. Satisfying portion size. Texture is perfect, moist with a couple whole kernels inside. I just like my cornbread with a little more buttery/sweet flavor. Could picture breaking this up over a bowl of chili and enjoying. 
-Sauces. They have 6 flavors and you can find, sweet, spicy, smokey, vinegary varieties. I personally could not pick one that really did it for my taste buds, but none of them were bad at all. I think I was just overwhelmed, might be better to get just two at time. 

Very nice to find they don't skimp on sides and that the sizes are about a cup. Ordered one slice of cornbread, but got three in my order so I was a little confused if cornbread came with any of the meals or they just threw extras in there. Pleasantly surprised by the meat portions and that all of the meat was moist. Also think the pricing is reasonable and appropriate. 

For just opening I think they have done a good job (probably due to their experience since this is a chain). All in all, I think this is a solid chain place, really enjoyed some things and thought other things were just okay. I would like to check them out again, give things a second shot."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"OMG SO GOOD! I saw this place pop up in my Yelp feed and immediately bookmarked it as a place to check out ASAP and so glad I did! Other reviews say this place is hard to find, but a quick look at the map and you can see it is in the middle of East 8th street (a side street between Prospect and Euclid), and if you're going East on Euclid you can see a big banner on the side of the building. I was lucky and got a spot right on Euclid and with a few quick steps I was inside and quickly seated at the bar with my friend. 

First off, very nice modern and classy decor, and very spacious. The kind of style that doesn't need to try and still comes off as an inviting and perfect setting for a business meeting, happy hour with friends, or date night with your lover. The music played overhead is neither loud nor annoying; my friend was actually doing a little shoulder shake in her chair to one of the songs. 

Now for the food. During happy hour their bar snacks are a dollar off, they have $6 fancy drink specials, and a discount on their craft beers on tap as well. I skipped the drinks tonight and aimed my focus on the food. I started with the homemade bacon and cheese tots and instead of their ketchup, I asked for a side of their cajun aioli to dip my tots in. I'll be honest here, I usually don't like tots because they are too small and fried for my tastes, but I hadn't had carbs in 5 days and I was about to stab someone so I went with the tots. SMART CHOICE! They come in a serving size of 8 and are maybe double the size of a regular pre-made frozen tot. Ohh and that canjun aioli? Just the perfect amount of kick that went really well with the tots. 

Next up was a reuben sans bun with green beans instead of the house chips. The corned beef had a delightful. unique, slightly sweet taste to it that really made it stand apart from the stuff you'd get at Slyman's or Danny's Deli. I was told this is because they make their own brine for the corned beef and use various spices like nutmeg in it. I also really enjoyed the side of green beans; they had a light seasoning of salt and pepper on them and were cooked perfectly in my opinion (not so soft and limp like canned beans, but also not so stiff and gross like the frozen ones). I did steal two noodles from my friend's jerk pasta and lordy lordy, I must say I don't know how people can remain composed and not lick the sauce off the bowl that stuff was so good! 

One of the owners stopped by to see how we were enjoying our experience; I ALWAYS appreciate a business taking the time to make sure their customers are enjoying themselves. We all got to talking and the owner showed us the private banquet room in the back that can fit about 45 people and has it's own bar. I would definitely suggest this place for a Yelp event, a supper club, or even a professionals networking event. 

My bill was $21 including tax and 20% tip. Not bad in my opinion especially when the food is homemade and has real flavor. If you check in with the Yelp app you get 10% off your bill, and hold on to that receipt because it is good for 10% off their Sunday brunch! I will definitely be coming back and telling everyone about this great new addition to downtown!"
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"I'm torn on the rating for my review. Let me explain...

Al Pita takes over the Fresco Mexican restaurant space in Rocky River (this space seems to have a high turnover). Staff was pleasant and from talking to the owner I learned that he is Lebanese, his family runs Falafel Xpress in Lakewood, and he knows everyone in the Mediterranean restaurant business. He seemed excited and passionate about this new venture and explained that while there are a bunch of ""fast casual"" Mediterranean spots around town, he wanted his place to be more of a sit down experience. 

Since I had a guest visiting me for the weekend we decided to hit up Al Pita and get a sampling of their menu:

*Kibbeh $8 - 3 pieces 
*Non-Vegetarian Grape Leaves $9 - dozen
*Vegetarian Sampler $17 - regular hummus, baba, avocado hummus, falafel, taboulah
*Mediterranean Mix Grill $26 - beef and chicken shawarma, half a chicken, rice, side. 
*Baklava $6 - two pieces
*Knafa Mabromeh $5 
Total $71

Let's start with the good stuff. Right off the bat, the food smelled amazing! They also allowed me to do a special request for one of the sides which I really appreciate. The regular hummus is pretty good, as was the kibbeh which seemed to have some cinnamon in it? Taboulah was lemony and fresh.The half-chicken/Farroj was so juicy with lots of herbs/spices and some nice bits of crispy skin. The falafel is definitely crunchy, no worry about them getting soggy.  Baklava was A-Ok as well (still like my mom's the best though). 

Now time for the not so great. I could not taste garlic in the garlic paste/sauce. To me a good garlic paste has a nice bite to it, a little goes a long way to enhance your meal. This stuff was too bland, more like regular mayo. I also did not like the rice, it was cooked al dente, so too hard for me, but my dining companion didn't mind it. The grape leaves were disappointing since they had the hard rice and no flavor. The non-vegetarian version is supposed to have meat and tomatoes mixed in but I could not see or taste them. Neither of us thought the avocado hummus was anything special so just stick with the regular hummus. With the beef shawarma I had to spit out a couple of pieces because they were just chewy gristle. Lastly, the knafa was missing the sugar syrup that makes it a sweet dessert. 

So to wrap it up, Al Pita is a clean sit down restaurant with pleasant staff. They have some pretty good meal items and they have some items I would not order again. While prices are similar to The Fountain in Westlake, they are still higher than any fast casual Mediterranean/Middle Eastern place in the area which is somewhat deterring. I might get the mixed grill (mmm half chicken) one more time if I can do hummus and taboulah for my sides because overall those things were the tastiest, and with the portion size you can get at least two meals out of this dish (you better for $26), but other than that, I don't see myself going back to Al Pita. I get take-out more than I dine-in so them being a sit down restaurant gets no points from me. There are just too many tasty cheap places out there (Oasis, Dolce Wraps, Sittoo's, Ferris Deli, Boaz Cafe, Naf Naf Grill, Falafel Xpress, etc).

I rate them 3.5 stars."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Excellent tea room and one that I would highly recommend!

I've been to just about every place that serves afternoon/high tea in the Northeast Ohio area and Miss Hickory's is definitely ranked towards the top!

Miss Hickory's is a converted house that has both intimate private dining rooms for tea upstairs and larger public spaces on the main floor, they even have tea on the patio when the weather is nice! This is not one of those places that is overly done like a sweet grandma puked up fake flowers and doilies everywhere. It's just enough decor to make it lovely so that you go ""awe how nice"" instead of gagging at an intense old lady theme. Staff does wear a uniform of black dresses and white aprons which kind of gives the vibe that you are special rich guests from 1890 with a servant. 

You do need to make reservations, but I like that they don't make you give your credit card information in advance. I always get the afternoon/high tea if possible, but it's great no one in your party has to decide what they are gong to eat weeks ahead of time. 

Four of us meet up for tea and we all partook in the tea sampler $15 which includes four different finger sandwiches, a slice of their lemon tea bread, and a scone of the day with jam and cream. You get a large strawberry to finish things off. We all also added a cup of soup $3. Some got the chicken spaetzle soup and some got the special of chicken gnocchi soup. Both were thick and creamy and very tasty. Oh man, and then there is the pot of tea $4! I picked the Arctic Raspberry tea and enjoyed it's light fruit flavor. My friends all went with different flavors and so it was nice to share a cup of what they got. If you're counting: the sandwiches, breads, tea and soup came to $22 which is on the lower to average end for an afternoon tea. I've been to a place that charged $35 for a high tea and their items were not as good! 

We were celebrating a birthday so it seemed like bonus dessert was a must. I will say there was one disappointment and that was the signature chocolate cake $8. Definitely a size that you can split but overpriced and not good. The sugar rose on top was hard enough I thought I was going to crack my teeth! The little bit of marshmallow cream filling was nice, but the cake itself was dry. Would not order this again. 

Some additional notes: we had excellent service and never felt rushed to get out of there. Your tea comes in your own little tea pot with a matching cup/saucer. The cashier wears a gorgeous huge hat. Miss Hickory's is named after the owners favorite childhood book. 

About tea rooms: some make you order the afternoon/high tea in advance and want a credit card number, some let you choose it right then and there. Some places give you a sample of their featured tea, some offer salad or soup, some just sandwiches and bread, some add mini desserts. Portion sizes can be dainty or leave you stuffed. Locations can be in a shopping plaza or in a Victorian house. Prices can be reasonable or expensive. Every tea party is an experience, but few places do it really well. I say out of everything, Miss Hickory's does a great job and is surely a wonderful time to be had with friends or family. A perfect spot for a bridal shower, a little girl's birthday, or just some fancy lady time with your friends."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"I have been to Trio twice now and feel a 3 star rating is appropriate. Trio describes themselves as modern American fine dining and from the dishes you can tell they are really trying to express their unique innovative side. Something a little different compared to their sister restaurant, 111 Bistro, in Medina. Both use fresh ingredients and look tasty, but perhaps one is more appealing to the masses and the other is still working out their kinks. Neither restaurant is cheap to dine at. 

My first visit to Trio I sat at the bar and sampled their Happy Hour menu (3-6p). The bartender was pleasant to chat with and service was spot on. They have select cocktails for $5.

*Lamb Neck Slider $6 - This was good. It was like a shredded roast beef on a buttery toasted bun. 
*Wagyu Taco $6 - A double layer of stiff flour shells. I left one layer on the plate and ripped off the stiff parts on the remaining shell as it was not enjoyable to eat. I was not impressed by the wagyu and thought it was leaning towards overcooked. The corn salsa with pickled onion was good though. 
*Favas $9 - This tasted fresh and healthy. Nice smooth avocado spread with crunchiness from the seeds/nuts. Good until I bit into a pebble...
*Parsnip Tiramisu $7 - Definitely unique; I did not like the coffee foam, but the parsnip puree was good. It reminded me of fall flavors (think nutmeg, cinnamon) and the shortbread crumbles added texture to the dish. 

Second experience was with a group of 10. We were put in a closed off corner and it was toasty. Our sever was asked twice to close the door that was open to the warm outside and turn on/up the A/C or at least turn on the fan. I think she might have been overwhelmed as she did not seem personable and the bartender had to help her out a couple of times. (Another thing to note is they apply a 20% tip for groups.)

*Carbonara $10 - Some people liked this but I did not care for it. I just prefer the creamier/bacony version. Reasonable portion size though and light on sauce so you won't feel bad indulging in some carbs. 
*Bread $6 - This was 3 different kinds of thick crusty french bread with honeycomb, fruit compote, and stracciatella. Simple and enjoyable. 
*Cake & Ice Cream $8 - This was unique; torn on if I liked it or if it was odd. Pistachio and anise flavors. The cake is definitely thick and a little dry so if you didn't get much frosting in your bite you'll need a gulp of water to swallow it down. 
*Carrots $7 - Not a fan of this dish. Carrots cooked al dente tasted sweet and nutty. 
*Scallops $14 - No one at our table liked this dish. The two sauces overpowered the scallop, especially the lemon one which made my mouth water and pucker up as it was so tart. 
*Meringue $6.50 - Not for me. The Meringue was very hard, I really had to wack at it to break off a piece. 

All in all, I think there are some creative ideas here just maybe the execution could use some tweaking. Check this place out for yourself and form your own opinion, you might think its amazing. It could be a cute little spot to share wine and small plates with someone. I just think there are so many restaurants around Cleveland it's hard enough to keep checking out your favorites let alone go back to one that didn't wow you from the start. I will keep my eye on Trio though, they might blow up and prove my taste buds wrong."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Stopped in on a rainy Wednesday night and got some goods from each restaurant to bring back home. 

The Ohio City Galley reminds me of the food court in college/at malls - you have several options for food then communal tables to eat at on one side and on the other side you have a bar where you can partake in some fancy cocktails if you want. First thing I noticed when I walked in was being greeted with a smile and a hello. Everyone I encountered was friendly, patient, and eager to help me decide what to order. Only a sprinkling of other customers inside. 

Sauce the City: I got the Cleveland hot chicken which comes with Mexican street corn $14.95. This sandwich was the best thing I ate here. Since I got it to-go staff was great about packing up the everything separately so I could assemble at home without worry the fried chicken breast would get soggy. Indeed when I got home there was still crunch to the fried chicken which appeared to already be covered in a medium hot oil. I added the ranch/blue cheese sauce and topped with their sweet crunchy coleslaw. Very tasty. I will say that I did not care for the bun, it was too thick/dense and takes away from full enjoyment. I ended up taking off the bottom bun. As for the street corn, did not really care for it. Not sure if the taste was lacking because it was cold or if because corn is not in season right now. I would suggest they get some 2-4oz sauce containers for to-go orders instead of dumping sauce into a sandwich box.

Tinman: Tried the Chicken and Dumplings $17. Disappointed with this dish. Only flavor I got from it was soy/salt. They use thighs and the texture was almost rubbery? Since it wasn't busy maybe I got some old food? Dish seemed lacking and was the one I thought I overpaid the most for. 

POCA: Sampled the Guac $9. This was the only place to provide napkins and utensils for my to-go order. The guac came with cilantro, cheese, and mole? along with tostadas. Guac was good, but I did not like the chips as they tasted weird/burnt. 

The Rice Shop: Snagged a Shrimp Toast $7. At first I was a little taken aback by the price for the size, but I really enjoyed this. Deep fried of course, but had a big chunk of shrimp and idk if juicy is the right word, but this thing was juicy and crispy and I liked it. I think I would prefer to dip it into some sauce though. This place had to borrow take-out containers from the business next door. 

Overall I like the concept of a trendier food court (food hall) you can drink at, and the personable staff is awesome, however I do think everything is a little overpriced for what you get (both food and experience) and for that this is not a place I would really make many future visits to unless they brought prices down a few bucks. I am mixed on the food as some things were pretty good and other things not so great. They just opened so probably will be better down the road. 

Honestly, I love how locals are getting the chance to open up their dream restaurants with the help of The Galley Group. I do hope they learn a lot and succeed. I'd like to see more of Sauce the City and I hope they add dishes to their menu. I would also give Tinman another try as I heard their burger is pretty good. And I do need to try main dishes at POCA and Rice Shop. So right now 3 stars and I will update my review if needed once I give Ohio City Galley another shot."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"3.5 stars because this place is A-Ok.

Let's start from the beginning. Rood sounds like rude, but it's a Dutch word meaning red. The owner just liked the word so that's the story behind the name. If you had read the Cleveland Scene article from March 2017 you'd be expecting this place to have a little wider selection of a menu, but it looks like they decided to start out with just sliders and pie when they finally opened November 2018. 

For food I decided to try out their happy hour (4:30p-6:30p) and get the two sliders with yuca chips for $9. I also partook in a HH ginger pear cocktail $5. 

With the HH sliders they make them for you so you can mix and match from a choice of 4 fillings. On the normal menu you pick only one filling and you put the slider together yourself. Normal menu pricing ranges from $10 for brussels sprouts to $18 for candied duck. I went with the dry rubbed pulled brisket with a little apple & pear slaw on top served in the cardamom roll and the ancho pulled chicken with a little jicama slaw on top served in the curry roll. I liked the portion sizes of the sliders, they definitely weren't wimpy looking. I also enjoyed the flavors of the meat and the buns; slaw didn't really stand out but did help with texture. I did however find myself thinking the sliders could use some sauce, not that they were choke on dry, but something was missing. 

Served with the HH sliders were yuca chips. These can be purchased separately for $3. They were good, but again I felt something was lacking because they don't come with any sort of dipping sauce. If you can't tell by now I like the condiments, I like my meat moist and I like to dip things. So if you're cool with the basics you'll probably like this place a lot more. I also need to note that on the menu it appears that there is no other side to purchase. So you're spending about $15 on a meat, some buns, and some coleslaw that you assemble yourself into a slider. That's it. 

I mean, cool for the experience if you come with a couple of people and everyone gets a different meat and you share. I'm guessing you can get 3 sliders out of each depending on how you portion out the main filling. But to me this isn't really a full meal. It's not several different tapas you share, it's just sliders. Definitely try it out, but how many times are you going to go back for just sliders? I'd view it as more of a place for a snack/light meal/social time with drinks. I actually left still a little hungry after my two sliders and chips. Maybe I'm a fat American used to filling up my belly and having leftovers. 

Here is where I was glad the waitress peer-pressured me into getting a slice of pie to-go. I don't normally eat pie and I wasn't really finding the pie menu alluring, but when in Rome. I went with the banana cream pie $5.75 and ate it when I got home. This is worth 5 stars! Just such a tasty delight to my mouth! Glad I didn't finish it off and have more in my fridge waiting to be savored. 

So in summary, give this place a try. Decor is dimly lit with that hipness of a pink neon flamingo light and some walls covered in green plants. Service is satisfactory. Street parking. Don't dine here alone. Pie amazing. Sliders good (better if they had homemade sauces to add to it). I think this place has a lot of potential, I just would like to see several sides added to the menu for people who need a bit more sustenance/variety."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"With all of the options in or around Rocky River for tex-mex (Chipotle, Qdoba, Moe's, the soon to open Bomba Tacos), I just wasn't impressed with Fresco and probably won't make a second trip any time soon. Don't get me wrong, the food was okay, but I suppose I prefer food that tastes better than okay. I like the kind of food that makes you happy you have leftovers, the kind of food that you crave and think fondly of, the kind of food you tell your friends about. I didn't get that here.  

Fresco takes over the short lived Mad Tex Burgers N' Mex in the Beachcliff plaza. Walking in you've got the standard set up and decor for fast casual dining. The place is new, clean, and the staff friendly, but unless you're talking to the manager don't expect them to know much about the menu as they are still learning it so be patient. Portion sizes and prices aren't bad, you're going to pay about $7 for a Chipotle sized burrito. They do have a salsa bar, but so does Moe's in North Olmsted. 

Now the food: I got the Fresco Burrito with the addition of sauteed peppers and onions. Although big, this burrito lacked flavor and left me disappointed. In addition to the rice, chicken, and sour cream, there was a very thin layer of refried beans, very little pico de gallo, MIA lettuce, MIA shredded cheese, and MIA queso fresco (those things might have been in there, but since I couldn't see them or taste them, I'm saying MIA), plus the burrito was so dry inside that I had to break open my burrito and add a couple 1.5oz containers of the fresh tasting salsa from the salsa bar. If you're getting this to-go, word of caution, they dump the chips on top of the burrito in the bag so good luck with that. 

I also sampled the Pulled Pork Tacos (3 for $8) which are labeled as award wining, but I didn't see any information on what award was won? The soft tacos were better than the burrito, but I wouldn't call the meat juicy or flavorful. In regards to the Fire Roasted Poblano & Jalapeno Bites (pretty much jalapeno poppers), they had a little kick and were good with the creamy cilantro sauce. You get 5 in an order for $6.

All in all, I hate that I can't leave a better review for this family owned business, but the food was just basic and lackluster in my opinion. They are new so maybe I just came in on an off day so I might eventually try them again. Listen, I love food, and I have definitely eaten more than my fair share of dishes at hundreds of places, I just think there's a lot of competition out there with similar offerings and if I'm going to spend my money then I want something that stands apart from the rest and is full of flavor. Sorry, Fresco :(

****UPDATE
The owner reached out to me in a private message that was very polite, addressed any issues I had, and offered to make up for a mistake in my meal (apparently I was given the wrong burrito). I greatly appreciate businesses that take the time to listen to customers and truly want them to have a great experience. Because of this I am raising my two star review to a three star and will definitely be back to give the food another shot (waiting a couple months so they can settle in a bit more).

As for the award, they competed with over 25 restaurants at the Grill for Good in Kent in 2013, to win first place for their pulled pork, all the while raising over $10,000 for the Coleman Foundation, based in Kent. They got the same award in 2014 for their barbacoa."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon specifically for the wine and waffle pairing they were promoting on social media. I'd say my first experience was A-Ok. 

I got street parking (be careful, if you park in the small lot and take a spot meant for a tenant you'll need to move or get towed). You can sit at the bar, at a table, or cozy up on the couch. A bit chilly inside though and I was wearing a sweatshirt. You can do flights, glasses, or get a bottle from their store and drink it there for a $12 corkage fee. No happy hour. Limited food selection (think nuts, olives, cheese/meat boards). Staff is friendly, patient, attentive, and helpful. 

I love exploring all of the drink/food pairings around Cleveland. Usually you buy a ticket on Eventbrite that includes everything then just show up and get your goods and enjoy. Here things were a bit different. No advanced sales (no need to, only a handful of people there). Waffles were a separate purchase from the wine. I'd prefer one transaction, but not a big deal. I was expecting this to be like the pairing events I am used to attending (beer/donuts, beer/pie, wine/cookie dough, etc) but this was more like come drink wine and if you feel like it we have this guy selling waffles in the other room. Not much of a collaboration between the products it seemed (no wine infused batter/syrup). If you did decide to get waffles the wait time was awkwardly long between getting served your wine flight and getting the waffles. I understand, waffles are made fresh and he was on his own with only two waffle makers, I just wanted to enjoy the drinks and waffles at the same time because I thought this was a pairing. So I just sipped on water and browsed Reddit while I waited. 

*Waffles were made by Hungry Bear $10 - Three quarters of a waffle all with different toppings. Love the idea, but they hardened up fast and I broke a tine on the plastic fork they gave me. I found myself wishing there was more sauce or syrup I could add to soften up the bites. The waffle with bacon and blue cheese whip cream was the best. 
*Through Rosé Colored Glasses Flight $11.50 - Three 2oz samples of different Rosé. Each sample comes with a little card providing details about the wine. I did not care for any these. Usually if you're suggesting a specific wine be paired with a specific food it's because it brings out the flavors and elevates the experience. I was left wondering if they really thought rosé and waffles paired well or if they were just promoting their new rosé wines? 
*Chambong Tapiz Torrontes $7 - Like a beer bong but with wine/champagne, so classier? A gimmick, but fun to try. 

So yeah, my first experience at Flight Cleveland was not the best, but it wasn't a bad one either. Perhaps just some misunderstanding over what they advertised as a pop up/pairing, and my experience with pairings made me have higher expectations. Also, they didn't make the waffles, but they partnered with the vendor so it all gets included in the review. 

However, I will definitely be giving them another shot. Now that I know the setup I'd like to try them again, but without their recommendations and no pop ups. Flights of red wine with a cheese board while relaxing on their sofa sounds like a better time. Plus I think this place would offer a warmer/more intimate vibe if you came in the evening with friends or a date. Come in with a focus on wine and no expectations and I am sure you'll enjoy yourself!"
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Listen, imma gonna give it to you straight. I just walked out of Bakersfield looking like a happy, sweaty, pregnant walrus and I have no regrets. Stuffed AF ya'll.

Disclaimer: I've had two of their alcoholic beverages and they are deceptively strong. Like ""Ooohh yeah this pineapple margarita ($10) is amazing! I can't even taste the liquor! Bring me one of those pretty sangria's! ($9)"" And the next thing you know you're being feisty and harassing the wait staff again. Whatevs, they liked it. At least that's what my lawyer is going to argue...

Sorry, I got off track, let me start at the beginning. We had our monthly supper club here tonight. I was not allowed to reserve a table so a couple of us showed up early to snag seating for 15. (Apparently there were 3 others in our group but we got separated in the crowded room. I think they might have been the three ballerina's at one of the standing tables. If that was you I'm so sorry! I didn't check my messages until it was all over! I have failed as a host.)

Anyways, we were served by Matt (aka Chewy) and Brandon. Both did an excellent job with our big group. Pleasant and attentive. We also had the manager Joe (aka Haley Joel Osment) wandering about us like a homeless person ready to pounce at any taco left behind. Just kidding, he was nice and just making sure everything was going okay. (It was his first day). Oh and this reminds me, Joe and Mr. General Manager Neil are some tasty looking eye candy. Meow, come here and sit on this spinster cat lady's lap! 

Alright, now that I'm banned from Bakersfield, let me wrap up this review. I think most of us partook in the make your mama holler special (I just made that name up) where groups of 6 or more are allowed to get shareable appetizers (chips, chunky guac, salsa, cheese dip), the most delicious salad, and a variety of tacos for just $15 each! And it was served endless style, like they loaded us up! ""Oh you need more tacos? No problem! Let me get you taken care of, sexy lady"". Okay, they didn't really say sexy lady, but I'm 31 years old currently sitting in the shower, alone, while I write this so I'm gonna dream damn it!

I'd say the food and drinks were pretty tasty. Drinks are a bit pricey, but they made me happy so I'm gonna make it rain (as in, take all my money for those not up on the cool kid slang). Service was awesome, decor was western industrial?, definitely had a trendy but laid-back vibe to it. My only complaint would be that it did not appear their A/C was working. This was bad because it was 70° out and raining and they had the windows and doors open so it was super humid and warm inside. Like I'm an extra juicy babe, ya'll can't be subjecting me to those conditions unless you want to personally wipe the sweat off my body. 

Okay, I'm probably gonna regret this review in the morning, but YOLO. Actually I already regret that stupid saying. I'm done. Time to watch Golden Girls.




**Update: Upon some reflection I had to dock a star for the whole hot and sweaty situation. Several members of our group complained about it and I know I felt really gross and immediately hopped in the shower when I got home. You should be using the A/C on hot and rainy days, don't be leaving those doors open and letting the humidity in, especially with it being crowded inside. If there is an issue with the A/C get it fixed ASAP cause summer is a comin'! They just opened two weeks ago so hopefully this was just a fluke. But you should definitely still check them out! Just maybe wear thin breathable fabric and have a towel to dab your face/body with."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"I've decided that I like ramen so I have been trying to check out all of the places serving it. Not a ton of options on the west side: you've got Noodle Cat, Xinji Noodle Bar, Lucky's Market, Mason's Creamery, and now Ninja City. You might think ""hey 5 is plenty!"", but one is in Crocker Park (large shopping centers are a deterrent for me), one is inside a grocery store so it's more for to-go, and one only serves ramen in the winter. You could throw in Dante, but they only serve ramen from like 9:30pm to 11pm. So unless I am missing a place the main restaurants for ramen on the west side are Xinji and Ninja. I am very pleased to have both of these!

I showed up at Ninja on a Monday and lucky for me this is when they have $3 steamed buns! This is great because you can buy one at a time and mix/match! Other places you have to buy two and they have to be the same kind. I am a fan of options/variety. They have standards like chicken, pork, tofu and shrimp, but also create two unique buns every week! I tried the chicken gyro on special and the pork. The pork one was my favorite but both were pretty good. 

My arrival coincided with happy hour until 6pm. I enjoyed a dollar off my tasty lychee mojito $7. I saw HH also offers a couple dollars off their bento boxes so I will definitely be back for that! (It's where you can build your own combo of 3-4 little plates). 

But my main reason for stopping was for the ramen. I ordered the shoyu with the bacon option $12.95. It looked great, but I'm going to be real with you, this smelled unpleasant. I guess it was the nori, but it had a strong fishy smell to it and I had it packaged up after a couple bites. I will say that when I tried it again the next day after watering it down the fish smell/taste was not as bad and I ended up enjoying the ramen. I would try this again, but ask for no nori/seaweed. Another thing to note is that I did not see any chili paste/oil for me to add to the dish which would have been nice to have. To sum it up, not the best, but a decent ramen. I was told they are more known for their pho. 

I've also tried the banh mi $12.95 and the pork rangoons $3. I'm not a fan of pâté and would ask for the sandwich/sub without that next time, but overall the banh mi was really tasty and flavorful! This large sandwich/sub held up to being refrigerated and reheated which is great because I'm often not finishing things/order too much and then have to eat it a couple days later. Oh, and it includes a side of fries or tots. I went with the fresh cut specially seasoned fries (with their chipotle aioli for dip, no ketchup for me please). 

As for the pork rangoons, I was expecting gooey cream cheese inside but it was like a pork meatball instead. I was disappointed for about two seconds then realized how good these things were especially with a little dip into lime aioli! It should be noted that my price for rangoons was cheaper because I paired them with an entree, they are slightly more when ordered just on their own. 

I like Ninja a lot. I'm excited to come back and try out more things (no nori or pâté for me though). I came in at a time when it was slow so I got a relaxed environment with attentive service. They have free wi-fi but they also were playing a movie on one of the TV's at the bar - I really appreciate a place that doesn't blast sports in your face 24/7. I think the price is affordable especially when you come on a Monday during happy hour. One minor complaint is that neither server seemed to know how to separate a dine-in order from a to-go order. The latter does not get taxed and tip is not obligatory. Otherwise, no issue and I'd recommend Ninja City!"
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Would NOT recommend for groups bigger than two people. 

I host a monthly supper club at restaurants around Cleveland and since Barroco in Lakewood has such a great following we were all excited to check out their new location on the east side. I contacted the owner, Juan, in advance and again the day before just to keep things smooth since we were a larger group. However we were meeting at 6:30 on a Wednesday night so I was assured everything would be okay anyway.

A couple of us arrived early and were greeted by a friendly bartender. We were told they they were going to sit us on the patio, but then said they couldn't. No big deal, we were the only people inside the restaurant. Our server seemed personable and I really enjoyed the colorful decor.

BUT, things went downhill immediately. It took a while for all of us (total of 10) to get our waters, then we had to wait more to get our drinks. Our server was also responsible for the people out on the patio and said that there was only one bartender so we tried to be understanding and patient. Our server kept saying she'd be back to take our order but would disappear for long periods. After some time goes by I'm like we need to order, I like these people I'm sitting with but good chats can't overcome hangry. Server apologizes and thanks us for waiting, but she takes only the order for one appetizer then rushes off and we don't see her again until the appetizer is delivered. Finally she stops by again and we are able to place orders for dinner. 

8:30pm, we've been at Barroco two long hours. People are coming in and getting their food and leaving before our table is properly taken care of. I mean, we have people eating the sauces on the table because they are so hungry. We have one elderly diabetic that we're lucky didn't have a health issue waiting so long to eat. We have people wanting to get up and leave but when the server rushes by to fill up our waters she keeps reassuring us our food is on the way. Again we are seeing our server attend to multiple other tables and get them their drinks and food before us. 

I flag down another server and ask her how much longer for our food. Our server eventually comes over and says it's coming it's coming. She drops off one small guacamole, no chips, for 10 people to share to make up for the long wait. 

9pm hits and another member of our group tells the server we want our food now. Server says the wait was so long because they are bringing all of the dishes out at once. NO. It has been long enough. It doesn't take  hours to fry up some damn empanadas. Start bringing each dish to the table. One by one we slowly got our meals even though we had placed food orders long ago. 

With how things were happening you could tell our server was overwhelmed and not handling her tables properly. It appears the kitchen was not handling orders properly either. Was the kitchen deliberately not making our food and taking care of only the small food orders first even though they were placed after ours? It appeared there was no manager around to oversee things. 

The wait was not worth it. With meals arriving 2.5 hours after you were seated you're just over it and tired. Most dishes were left half uneaten because people just wanted to go home. I know I took two bites and asked for a box. I was done. We were the first table to arrive and the last to leave. Our server was nice the entire time, but this poor experience was just unacceptable and disappointing. We had new people at supper club that night and I was legit embarrassed that I had brought them there. I would not go to Barroco again. Sure they are popular, but it seems quality food/service has gone down with their expansion."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Gather round people, I've got a story to tell. First part: Hole-in-the-Wall Food. Second part: I'm Being Haunted by My Online Dates. 

Part 1.
Parkview is a definitely hole-in-the-wall place with an outside that seems like it might be a bit sketchy and a dated inside full of locals singing Mariah Carey Christmas songs. BUT do not let this deter you! As long as you're not stuck up Parkview will greet you with character and a little dusty charm. We had our monthly supper club here the other night and our server, Debbie, did an excellent job of taking care of a group of ten. She kept my water filled, answered any questions I had, and no issue with the many checks. 

The food here comes from a partnership between Parkview favorites and creations from the owner/chef, Joe, of the now closed Chow Chow in Lakewood. I started off with sharing an order of the deep fried piergoies $7 accompanied by burnt onion dip. You get three large potato pierogies that are very tasty. Next up several of us ordered the fried chicken with mac & cheese and a side of coleslaw instead of french fries. I had the original from Chow Chow, and while this version was okay, it was not as good. They are no longer able to get affordable meaty chicken breasts so they now go with one thigh and two legs (I prefer white meat so this was a little disappointing). Batter is still hearty with a good crunch. The mac & cheese is different, not as smooth, more of a gritty texture (roux issue, heat issue, type of cheese issue, or done on purpose, no idea). Overall though for $11 it was a decent meal that won't break the bank. Those who ordered this had plenty of leftovers to take home. 

I also ordered the corn succotash with polenta cake $11 to-go and I am so glad I did! Like the pierogies this dish was just like the original and still just as satisfying. I can't wait to go home and eat it for dinner tonight! It's a heavy meal but they give you assorted pickled veggies which helps cut the fat. As for other items on the menu I would definitely come back to try the French dip $9 (always in search of the best one) and the friend goat cheese salad $9. I might stay away from the pulled pork dinner $11.50 though because it came out with the fries swimming in the pork juice which left them soggy. There was also some sadness over the fried cheese curds from Chow Chow not being on this new menu (bring back that smoked banana corn ice cream sandwich!).

Overall I had a nice time in a chill environment surrounded by friends and I would come back for certain menu items. Plus Joe is a nice friendly guy so I have no problem supporting this local business. 

Part 2.
Roughly 3 years ago I went on a date with this guy who called himself Jeff the Butcher (he liked fondling raw meat, jk). He's an attractive guy and in all honestly the date was good: some SideQuest trivia, a kiss, and plans to meet again. It was his negative drunken follow up call a couple days later that killed things. Don't randomly complain about friends/family and excessively curse at someone you just met. 
 
Fast forward like a year and half later when I'm having a feisty Sunday with a friend at Banter and it turns out he is the cook there. Read that review for details. 

Present day Cleveland Supper Club is at Parkview. I notice this guy in the kitchen keeps looking at our table. I'm looking back wondering if this guy is familiar and who the heck is he? It's JEFF THE FREAKING BUTCHER. The kicker here is that the prior week Butcher man is showing Joe my yelp reviews. 

Moral of this story is that I eat out too much and I'm gonna die alone. On the bright side I live a fun successful life so sugar mama status is not far away. Soon I'll be able to afford Raúl the handsome ""handyman"" so don't feel bad for me."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"I saw a picture of a fancy delicious looking cheese platter on Yelp and immediately wanted to come to Old Brooklyn Cheese Company. I showed up on a Saturday afternoon and what I found was a simple cheese shop with an owner who is very passionate and knowledgeable about his cheeses.  

My friend ordered a sandwich and from what I gathered about their experience was that the sandwich was okay/good, but that the panini pressed bread was so hard it tore up the roof of their mouth. 

I ordered a 3 cheese board ($15) and was given a sampling of a 4th cheese on the house. This board was beautiful. Chunks of cheese paired with jams, mustards, fruits, nuts, honey, olive oil, and a basket of sliced bread. They don't write down what cheese you selected so from memory I think I got a cheese with peppercorns, some caramely cheese, and two bries... I think. The one that was melted I loved, but really I thought they were all good and ate the leftovers for breakfast the next morning. (Maybe write the names of the cheese down so if the customer likes it they can order more if they come back?).

We brought in our own bottles of water to drink.

Staff was definitely full of character and personable. They have no problem with letting you sample what they have to offer (be wary of the rattlesnake cheese, packs some heat!). The owner chatted with us for a bit which is something I always enjoy because it puts a face behind the name, lets you learn more about the product/vision, and it allows you to establish a positive connection to the business.

Another great thing about this business is that they are very local. By that I mean they sell cheese created in-house, locally, and from other countries; some local pickles (Randy's Pickles); some local bread (Blackbird); some local jams (Cleveland Jam) and meats (Europa Charcuterie); and beverages (Old City Soda). So it's a wonderful place if you need to pick up cheese and want to support a local shop who sells other locally made items that pair well with the cheese. It's also a wonderful shop if you have money to spend to impress your work or other groups of people ($100 cheese platters), because these platters are fabulous. Way better than your standard Giant Eagle fair. 

So why 4 stars instead of 5? Because while I enjoyed my experience, I still felt like something was missing. I couldn't think of a reason to come back soon. I'm not at sugar mama status just yet so I can't afford to purchase the large platters for social occasions. I'm also solo so buying blocks of cheese, a large tube of cured meat, or even a whole baguette is not something I do. That stuff would go bad faster than I could snack on it. And while I know some places around Cleveland offer BYOB, that's illegal and Old Brooklyn is not even gonna risk it so no wine to pair with that cheese. 

If Old Brooklyn Cheese Company sold wine and offered wine tastings in the future I would 100% support them. As a young professional I enjoy a place I can meet up with friends or dates after work and enjoy a lovely cheese board and a drink. Down the road I think I'd come in for a 3 cheese board again (or a meat and cheese board if they have it?), I'd just get it to-go and assemble at home for better enjoyment. Otherwise if you don't care about selecting your own cheeses I heard that Vino Veritas is a new winery right down the road that sells little cheese boards from Old Brooklyn (this might be more of what I'm looking for). 

Lastly, as we were paying our bills, my friend was told they didn't have to tip but the staff member awkwardly watched the screen and asked if I was going to. I'd suggest turning the screen completely away and taking a step back so the customer can decide about gratuity without the staffs influence. 

I encourage you to check this place out and decide for yourself!"
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"I see some Yelper's are not feeling the love for Forage, but that's okay, this is why I highly suggest people read a couple of reviews to get a mix of opinion before they decide to check a place out or not. Everyone has different tastes and different experiences. I went with a group of eight and I personally really enjoyed what Forage had to offer!

Forage is in the old Pacers space on the first level of the tall Lakewood Center North building. You can catch free parking after 6pm along the street or in a lot next door. The decor is simple, clean, and they have a gas (or fake) fireplace in one corner that looks cozy. I had reservations so there was no wait (but it was a week night so you could definitely just walk in and get a table no problem). No issues with service - I thought it was pretty standard, they gave us space to enjoy our meal and chat, but it's not like we had to flag them down for everything either. 

For the food I did get to sample a couple of appetizers:
-Farmer Lee Jones Beets $13 - One guest really liked this dish. I thought it was okay, could have used some pepper to season it and some more feta. 
-Poutine $10 - Came in a big bowl so plenty to share. I did like that they were fresh cut fries and they used cheese curds (instead of cheapening the dish with shredded cheese), but I thought it could have used more gravy (you're supposed to eat this with a knife and fork, not your fingers).
-Devils on Horseback $9 - Simply delicious! Only three in an order, but really tasty and big enough that you can't pop a whole one in your mouth. Definitely spurge and get this!
-Daily Oysters on the Half Shell $? - First time trying. Not a bad taste... more of a weird texture. Not my thing. 
-Stuffed Pasture Raised Eggs $9 - This was another really tasty item with six in an order. I tend to stay away from deviled eggs because I think they'd just be simple and bland, but these were so creamy and mmm good. 

For main dishes:
-I got the Open Faced BBQ Pork at $13 and really enjoyed it! I was happy to see it wasn't a tiny portion, but instead nicely sized so you don't miss not having a side and you can share a couple bites with others. I'm a firm believer that shredded pork tastes better with a crunchy slaw and this did not disappoint as it also had crispy onions on it. The pork had some sweetness to it and the cornbread was slightly moist. I'd get this again for sure. 
-Ohio Beef Burger $9 for plain - One guest said they had this in the past and it was one of the best burgers they'e had. Just watch out for all of the additional charges for each topping you add. 
-Bahn Mi $10 - I only had a small bite of this, and honestly I don't remember too much about it besides that it smelled good and that you'd have to have a secure set of teeth to rip the bread. It comes with kettle chips, but you can upgrade to pommes frites with garlic, rosemary and aioli. (Love me some aioli!).
-Rainbow Trout $17 - Two guests got this and the overall opinion seemed to be that it was okay, but a little lackluster. 

Two guests did get dessert: Single Origin Belgian Chocolate Creme $9, and they both seemed to really enjoy it. I was just way too stuffed for dessert, but I will definitely be back to try some! 

Their craft beer menu is not that impressive, but hey, they still had some and I was there to eat not be a snob about my drinks. 

To sum it up, I think Forage has some really great dishes that your taste buds will enjoy, but like every restaurant, they are going to have some ""just okay"" dishes as well. Perhaps I lucked out with my choices. I think going out with a pleasant enjoyable group of people also has an impact on your dining experience. I really have nothing that bad to say that would cause me to give this place lower stars. It is a little pricey, but still affordable depending on what you choose and the portions are decently sized. Besides, I don't know about you, but I'd rather pay a little more for a place that buys their goods locally and tries to make everything in house instead of getting everything pre-made, in cans or frozen."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Four stars, cause ""Yay, I'm a fan!"".

What a nice addition to the west side! Living in RR it's not often I go further west for food as I think you're getting more into suburban life/chains/not as fresh and fun/not worth the drive, but I was happily surprised to find this new establishment and I will definitely be back to enjoy more of it! 

I arrived right at 6pm on a Wednesday and the parking lot/inside was already packed! Luckily I was able to grab one of the last spots at the bar. This place does not take reservations so you better either come right when they open at 4pm or be ready to wait. While staff was definitely busy, they seemed very capable and personable. It was nice to see a mix of ages inside and all of the other patrons I encountered were friendly. 

Eric, who I think manages the bar, came up with some tasty cocktails ($10). He also hooked me up with the wifi password and gave me a little info on Thyme Table. From what I understood this place came together from people living in Bay Village who had food experience (one guy was a instructor at Sur La Table, someone else is friends with Jill Vedaa from Salt, another worked at Dante, etc) and they wanted to bring a happening  tasty spot to their area like what you see with the food scene in areas closer to downtown, but without super high prices and pretentiousness. What they created is this little ""upscale tavern"" that while it's menu is not expansive it does offer high quality dishes. You can come in for cocktails (or beer on tap) and appetizers or get you an entree followed up with dessert. But it's also a good spot just to chat and share a bottle of wine. Ooo and wait until that 60 person patio opens once the weather gets nice! 

For food I tried the Roasted Beets $9, not a large portion, but just right with this delicious creamy/buttery tasting goat cheese and wonderful pomegranate molasses. Next up with the Loaded Lobster Tots $12. I'm not usually a tater tot person because they come out like hard little nuggets, but these babies seemed bigger and puffier while still having a light crisp outside. If that even makes sense. I don't know, just order this dish. This one you can most certainly share with a couple of friends and they will all love the chunks of lobster, cheese sauce, and a little kick from the chipotle aioli. Others really enjoyed their fried chicken on a biscuit sandwich $13 (although the biscuit reminded us of those pull-apart store varieties. Also need to note that they currently serve frozen fries, but I was told they will switch to fresh cut soon) and the seared tuna $21 with black sticky rice. To end things there was the Smore Cake $9. I gotta be real with you, this wasn't bad, but I was disappointed with it. Not a fan of cinnamon with the smore or that soft graham cracker cake bottom, and while the raspberry coulis enhanced the taste of the smore cake it was swirled around the outside of the plate so you had to scrape the thin line with your fork to get any. Sure it looks fancy/nice in a picture, but it's not reasonable for actual consumption. These things don't have to be mutually exclusive. 

All in all, I like it. Classy yet chill atmosphere. I enjoyed most of the food/drinks. For pricing, well I can't escape that poor farm girl mindset so I do think some items are a little bit overpriced, but the reality is that their pricing is comparable to other restaurants/bars - neither cheap nor expensive and if you want a smaller bill then skip the drinks and/or dessert. 

Update: They have happy hour from 4-6pm tues-sat with specials like $5 wines, $6 cocktails, and $2 off beer. For food you'll see lowered prices on the appetizers and some $7 sandwiches with fries. I suggest the ""BLT"" and add bacon to it. Not into the short ribs with soy $9, but definitely recommend the carrot cake dessert $9!  

Note: I know this place is popular, but please be respectful of the people who got there well before you did. It's rude for you to show up and ask someone who is the middle of eating to move down so you can sit next to your friend who is not even there yet."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Alright, I've had five meals here in a week so I have to rate them highly. I give them 4.5 - 5 stars.  

First visit was for the Cleveland Supper Club where about a dozen of us enjoyed dining in. They do not take reservations but were more than happy to help me push a couple tables together for our group and appreciated my calling to let them know in advance. I like the modern industrial decor with wood and metal; it's clean and trendy. Also note that there is a small parking lot behind the restaurant, street parking, or you can try parking at Lucky's across the street and walking over. 

This place is fast casual so you do order and pay at the register, grab your own drink, then they bring you your meal and clear your dishes. Staff is pleasant and while you cannot call this place budget friendly, I wouldn't say their prices are unreasonable either. Now, time for the food!

*Club Sandwich $14 - I thought it came with ""submarine sauce"" but all I got was mayo. No pickle spear this time either. BUT still an enjoyable sandwich. I like that they keep it at two slices of bread instead of three and I felt healthier by having my side be that slightly sweet vinegar coleslaw instead of fries at no extra charge. 
*Hummus $7 - Homemade with sliced veggies and pita bread for dipping. The celery was not the best looking and I was not a huge fan of the brand of pita they use, but the hummus was good. Homemade is always better than store bought; just creamier.  
*Reuben with Montreal Smoked Meat $15 - This was really tasty. I like me a nice pile of moist meat. Again I went with coleslaw as my side. I feel like the crisp vinegar taste cuts the fatty taste of the meat and really balances things out verses over doing it with greasy fries (although they are fresh cut!). 
*Fried Chicken Sandwich $10 - So they are super awesome for letting me customize this. I basically got a fried chicken breast, no bun, no toppings and instead a biscuit, coleslaw for my side and an extra side of mac & cheese $4. To me this was better than the dinner as the dinner is more expensive and includes dark meat which I do not like. They do season the fried chicken with a heavy dose of salt and pepper on top which is something I would ask to get without next time (hate salt). Besides that the chicken was good especially dipped in their hot sauce (homemade?). Although not the best I have ever had, the mac & cheese was still good. 
*Burrito Bowl with Pulled Pork $13 - I got this with a side of their signature BBQ Sauce. Oh man this was tasty! I had gotten it to-go and ate it the next day cold with no issues. There is a lot of rice so I did scoop out about a cup of it. Next time I would just ask for less rice. I would definitely order this again. Pulled pork was cooked perfectly (moist meat!). 
*California Bowl $13 - This has a lot of flavor: blue cheese, candied walnuts, basil dressing, etc. I do prefer the burrito bowl, but this was still good. Was eaten cold the next day and I removed some rice. 
*Chocolate Chip Cookie $2 - I guess technically this is an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie since it has ground up oatmeal in it, but whatevs, it is freaking delicious! Like perfect crispy outside and soft chewy center. One of the best I have had especially since they don't ruin it by sprinkling stupid salt on top (you've been dethroned BlackBird!)

So yeah, I think Landmark is doing a pretty good job. Since I've already blown through the menu and only have a couple other dishes I'd like to try I would like to see them change things up seasonally or maybe add some monthly specials (to keep interest up for someone who eats out way too often. Ugh, this is why I'm extra juicy.) If not I am sure they will still do well. Again, staff is pleasant and managers don't hesitate to correct any issues even if they are slight. 

Lastly, please note that they serve lunch at 11am during the week, but at at noon on the weekends. I regrettably turned into a hangry person when I called at 11:15 on a Saturday and was told they were only doing breakfast. ""It's lunch time, what do you mean you don't have lunch food at lunch time?!"". I apologize to the tall guy with the deep voice."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Coming here is a gamble, that's probably why they have you sign a waiver acknowledging that it is a teaching school and that you will not be serviced by a professional. They also tell you up front that a haircut could take two hours. I knew all of this and read the reviews where some had a great experience and some had chunks of their hair missing. I figured if the students are at the stage where they are practicing on people then they should have a decent idea of what they are doing. So I took the risk and went in for a cut. 

Luck was not on my side. 

Showed up for my 9:30am appointment and the place was hopping. I browsed the makeup and hair care displays while others arriving after me were taken back. After 20 minutes I inquired about my appointment. Apparently my student was running a little late and when she came out she kind of just stood there and stared at me while the receptionist introduced us, twice. Off to an awkward start. 

Back at her station she told me about the Brown Aveda experience, products they offered, and we discussed what I wanted done; basically just a good trim/reshaping and I even brought several pictures of myself with my hair trimmed and styled. Simple. We started things off with her having me sniff three sticks then her applying whatever one smelled the best to my scalp and attempting to give me a scalp massage. She said that she had been cutting hair for 7 months out of the year long program, but there was a lot of her looking things up on her tablet, flipping through papers, jotting down notes and quickly stepping away to ask a question or grab something. Next we went to the wash room where she shampooed my hair, put in a hydrating mask, put some oily products on my face, wrapped a warm towel around my face, awkwardly massaged my arms and hands with oily lotion, then rinsed my hair. I was in there for such a long time that my neck hurt from laying on that sink for so long. 

Back at her station she gets approval from an instructor to start cutting my hair. Fast forward to almost 4pm and I've been at this place over SIX HOURS. At first I tried reading magazines and chatting a little, but a couple hours in my body started shutting down from sitting there so long, that I just started staring desperately at everyone and praying they could understand the ""Help me!"" brain signals I was sending out. All of the other students around me were on their second or third customer after taking a long lunch break. I was trying to be understanding and patient, my student was nice, but this girl had no idea what she was doing. I kept looking for a way out, but I didn't think I could make a dash for the door without causing a scene so I stayed, and died a little inside. 

When it came time for the student to step away and the reviewer to come by and discuss my experience, I had tears in my eyes. I get that this is a teaching school, and while three different instructors came by to give advice (or actually stepped in to cut my hair themselves), none of them stopped to ask me how things were going or if I was fine sitting there for over six hours. Maybe I should have stood up and complained right away, but I don't have that kind of personality and I wanted to give this girl a chance; I kept hoping it would end up okay. 

It was a pretty bad experience and my hair reflected that. The cut was choppy and uneven, there were so many products in my hair that it looked like I hadn't washed it in two weeks and the fumes were giving me a headache. The reviewer said she had heard about what was going on (so apparently the instructors were talking about it), apologized, did not charge me, offered to have another stylist wash and style my hair and asked that I don't let one bad experience ruin my view of their institute. I declined her offer and instead swiftly made my way out the door and headed home where I took some Ibuprofen and scrubbed my hair twice. 

I can't give this place one star because I went in knowing it was a teaching school. However, I did expect the instructors to be more hands on and observant of their students and the customers. I came in for a simple trim and it never should have have taken over six hours. Instead of focusing on selling products and the free ""perks"", Brown Aveda needs to focus on teaching it's students how to master cutting hair."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"I think Townhall has good food and I did enjoy a painting event here once, but the atmosphere at night is just not my style. I stopped in with three others one Friday evening and the bartender was friendly, but they were out of a lot of ingredients to make their cocktails (I think it was because they were about to switch over to new flavors?). We moved to a table and enjoyed several items like Smashed Avocado $9, Sweet Potato Skins $9, Chicken Nachos $10, and Paella Flatbread $14. 

While we were eating we noticed this young woman, very done up, who was clearly out of her mind intoxicated. I'm talking eyes barely open, bumping into people, randomly dancing by herself, and trying to flirt with every guy who would let her. She had a friend with her, but not a very good one because she kept leaving her to wander around. We couldn't watch this disaster anymore and asked our server to get a manager and have this young lady and her friend go home because we didn't want anything bad to happen with her being so drunk. Apparently other patrons had expressed concern earlier and finally the girl and her friend left. Hopefully to get in an Uber and sober up at home. 

Ten o'clock came around this place went from busy to packed, but like packed mostly with white guys in their young twenties unsure of what to do with themselves. There was one older guy who brought his pet rabbit in with him, and there were several young ladies very noticeably not wearing bras, but that was pretty much it.  

I'm only 31, but I guess I left this awkward, crowded, college like bar scene a long time ago and it's just not appealing anymore. I don't want to have to shout to my friend a foot away because it's so loud inside. I don't want to witness super drunk young women put themselves in potentially bad situations. I don't want to be surrounded by young guys who are still trying to grow facial hair. I left early for the comfort of my home and have no regrets. 

Townhall is a trendy popular place, so if you're into a bustling sausage fest full of ""bros"", a cougar on the prowl, or just like to get super wasted while partaking in some Non-GMO vegan food with a sparkler in it, then enjoy to your heart's content! Nowadays I prefer going to Whole Foods on Fridays where for $5 I can enjoy 5 wine samples, pick up some single serve dinners, and still get home by nine with plenty of time to put cream on my eye wrinkles. 

Seriously though, get take-out or maybe the environment might be better during daylight hours?

Update**
The above was a three star review, but I've had to lower it because of the response I received from Townhall staff. First Kayla B. wrote a comment, but she deleted it and now you see a comment from Alex D. 

Alex is upset that I said ""white guys"" in my review and insinuates this is a racist remark. So let me rephrase that, Townhall lacks diversity. If you are a minority you might feel uncomfortable here. Alex is also upset that I said ""young twenties unsure of what to do with themselves"". So let me rephrase that, Townhall is full of an immature crowd. If you are aged you might not feel congruous with the atmosphere here. Alex then states that ""wardrobe selections are protected free speech"". I suggest Alex reads up about human rights and freedom of expression/speech under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the American Convention on Human Rights, or maybe even the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. I for one can't see where its says I'm not allowed to say what I saw: ""young ladies very noticeably not wearing bras"". I also said I saw a guy with a rabbit, does that mean I've insulted pet owners too? 

I like to use a little humor and satire when writing my reviews. In this particular one I even poked fun at myself at the end suggesting I'm just not young/cool enough for the scene at Townhall. And as Alex repeatedly mentions, I am an elite yelper, for several years now actually, and I think it's important for reviews to not just talk about the food and prices, but the patrons full experience including interactions with staff and the environment/crowd they encountered. With artistic license I set the scene for the night I came into Townhall and shared my experience - one review of hundreds that a reader can use to make up their own mind about Townhall. 

Alex seems to have taken my review very personally and tried to reprimand me with his comment, but to myself and those I've shared screenshots of his comment with, it appears Townhall just makes themselves look bad with their response. Bless their hearts."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"***Updating to one star due to poor attitude from owner in his response to my review. Would not recommend this business. My review is fair and honest based on my personal experience with this business including the conversation I had with the female owner (presumably David K's wife). Firstly, my bad due being told incorrect information, David did not own a restaurant previously, he just was heavily involved (""started a restaurant with another gentleman"") and it failed due to poor planning (""wrong concept for the area""). Secondly, out of the THOUSANDS of businesses in NEO, David offered just one other example of a business that has credit card surcharges. Still does not change the negative view of surcharges. Lastly, ranting/getting aggressive/defensive in response to a customer's opinion on Yelp is just going to make you look bad. A friendlier approach would have made me want to come in again and want to chat with you about your passion for food - likely causing me to have a better experience/impression of your business and thus raising your stars. Instead your behavior has caused me to have a lesser opinion of you and your business.****

Had no idea this place existed until I was randomly driving around the area one day and saw this big colorful sign for Best Damn Tacos and decided to check it out. Great Sign. 

I went with a variety of menu items to try:
*Carnitas Taco $3.50 - I never get hard tacos but theirs are homemade so I gave it a try and it was actually pretty good! 
*Pollo Taco $3.50 - Decent chicken taco. 
*Carne Taco $3.50 - Decent steak taco. 
*Camaron Taco $4.25 - I got this shrimp taco on a soft shell and it was pretty good as well. 
(Some notes: all of the tacos were good portion sizes and therefore I felt the price appropriate. The tacos are more basic in flavor. No stand out marinated meat, or sauce, or toppings to make anything pop - not necessarily a bad thing, but could be improved upon)
*Black Beans and Rice $4 - Not bad, like the heat, and it held up to being reheated a couple days later, but I did not finish this. 
*Guac $5 - Did not like the taste of this and the texture was weird. Seemed more like the processed stuff you buy at the store versus chunky and homemade. This was tossed. 
*Queso $6 - This had bacon in it and was good. Again, held up to being reheated. 

So all in all for the food, it's not bad. I just live closer to places like La Plaza, Bomba, and Barrio so while I do like to give businesses two tries, after that I'm not sure I would go out of my way to come here. If you live in the area and want to check this place out then I do recommend you try the pork taco, shrimp taco, and the queso. Make sure to dine-in so your tacos are fresh (mine got a little soggy by the time I could eat them). The decor is colorful with neat paintings/pictures and there is plenty of seating. Since it's located in a plaza there is plenty of parking too. 

Normally I would have given a place like this 3 stars for A-Okay, but I had to dock a star for this credit card surcharge they add to your bill. The lady said it was something new, but it is not. I'm not aware of anyone besides this business doing this. Credit card surcharges are actually prohibited in 10 states. Ohio does allow it, but a merchant imposing credit card surcharges is going to be frowned upon and it will deter customers since this practice is not prevalent in the local market. I understand merchants might implement credit card surcharges to deal with credit card processing fees, but that small profit does not seem worth the loss of profit from customers choosing to go elsewhere. However you can get around this by using your debit card if you do not have cash on hand. Surcharges cannot be imposed on debit or prepaid transactions. 

Another thing that came across as negative was while taking with one of the owners they said how they used to own another restaurant that closed and now they wanted something with low overhead. It was also mentioned that this place came together in 4 weeks. Nice person, all of the staff was friendly, this conversation just came off like not a lot of passion/thought went into things and they just wanted something to bring in easy/quick money. Hopefully the impression I was given is wrong. 

All of this has been included in my review because the entire experience you have with a restaurant impacts your view of them, it's not just the food that is important. 

They are pretty new so I am going to give them a couple months and try their offerings again then update my review accordingly if applicable."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Three of us went kayaking on July 7th. I had never been kayaking before so I was pretty excited to try this place out. I had picked Camp Hi because they don't require a reservation, I was told that I could show up any time because they have over 300 vessels so they would not run out. They only thing they warned was that if we came at noon there would probably be a wait to get on the bus that takes you to the river. I also thought the single kayak price for a 7 mile trip, $28 plus tax, was reasonable compared to other places I had looked at. I was a little worried about the water but was told the river is only 5 feet deep so that helped to quiet my fears about tipping over. 

We arrived at noon and immediately experienced confusion and disorganization. The place was busy with parking pretty full, there was no one out telling you where to park (if there were signs we did not see them) or making sure people parked correctly to fit everyone in (lots of double parking). So first we drove around the front lot, then the back lot, then found a side lot we could park in. When we walked up to the building we waited in line to get registered, but that was just taking our money, no one explained anything to us. So we just wandered around until I found a customer who had been there before and told us what to do. We needed to grab paddles, but the two sided ones for kayaking not the one sided ones for canoeing. And you have to get the right height paddle because they come in different sizes (apparently you stretch out your arm and get one that is taller than that). Then we grabbed a life jacket and had to wait on the front lawn in the sun for the school bus to come and take us to the water. 

Another thing is apparently we were supposed to have a number that identified us and where we were at in line but the lady who took our money never gave us a number. Oh man, and one of us had our own kayak but there was not clear instruction on where to drop it off at and how it was getting to the river. The people with their own kayaks get loaded up in a different vehicle that leaves at different times than the bus so they ended up having to wait at the drop off point until we were able to catch up wit them (I mean, we came together and wanted to cruise the river together so just be prepared to wait and be split up). 

Alright so we finally get on this school bus and head to the drop off point. I just have to say that staff is overwhelmed and confused themselves. Whatever system they have is clearly not working and causing disorganization and frustration. Plus we were told that one of the drivers called off so they were short a transport person. Finally we get into the water at 1:30pm, an hour and a half after we got to Camp Hi. Again, be prepared to wait. 

The kayaking part of things was nice. Like I said it was my first time but I caught on quickly. It was a beautiful day with perfect weather to be out on the water (even if the water is brown). There appeared to be some spots where people could pull off and take a break on land (we saw some do this), but we just kept going and finished our trip in about 2.5 hours. The river was pretty smooth with only one part ""rapids"" where things kicked up a bit. Also nice that you saw a lot of nature and not too many houses until the last part of the trip. One thing though is it would have been great if they posted some distance signs. I think I only saw one that said Camp Hi 4 miles, other than that the only notice we had was being told that the pick up/end was 1 mile after the bridge. We identified the end spot by the many canoes and kayaks sticking out. Luckily there were two young men pulling the vessels out of the water/out of the way so we were able to pull up. 

After your trip you walk up to the building and drop off the paddles and life jackets. Staff will give you back your car keys and remove the $20 deposit off of your credit card. Don't forget about the deposit or you'll accidentally get charged. You can also purchase one of their shirts here if you'd like. It was about 4pm at this time and things had definitely quieted down since most people had returned and left already. The two ladies working in the building were more personable/helpful and admitted they were stressed out earlier. One was eating pizza because she said she hadn't been able to eat lunch earlier. 

Overall, glad I went, I am a fan of kayaking now, however I do not think I will be back to Camp Hi unless they restructured things and hired more help. They have to know summer time gets busy and that overwhelmed workers negatively affect a customers experience."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"I've been checking out different exercise classes - everything from rowing, yoga, Zumba, Barre, to Elite Hops, and I even tried a hula hooping class! All of these were great to experience, but it was Orange Theory Fitness that clicked with me. 

Your first class is free, you just have to go to a location that is closet to where you live (or any location within 10 miles). You have to call and schedule your workout class, and you will have to give your height/weight so that they can set you up for the heart monitor (just breath it's okay, don't lie or you'll make the monitor inaccurate), plus your credit card. They will only charge your credit card if you don't cancel the class more than 8 hours in advance. So your first class you show up 30 minutes early to talk to a staff member and just go over what OTF is, what your looking to get out of it, and an overview of the workout/machines. (Side note, you can take an additional class for $12 if you're still unsure about joining, but after that it's $28 a class eek!). 

I was pretty nervous at first that I would be shamed/treated differently for being extra juicy or that I would fail at the workout compared to everyone else, but staff is super nice and helpful. They are there to help you become your best self and want you to succeed so no judgment! They are very accommodating too. Bad knee? They will offer modified exercises you can do. First time you've worked out in 12 years? No problem, it's okay to start with what you are comfortable with as long as you are willing to push yourself a little and try even if it's just going from an 8lbs weight to 10lbs or from 1% incline to 4%. Once you start surviving through the workouts you can then focus on beating your prior numbers. 

I've gone to four classes now and let me tell you, no one cares about you so get that negativity about your weight/ability out of your head. Seriously everyone is focused on themselves and completing the workout, no one cares what you look like or how many reps you did. If anything, people are looking for camaraderie. A friendly smile or ""hell yeah"" after that tough round on the rower or even a brief chat about if you're new, like the class, and what results you've seen. It's a positive sweaty environment. 

I feel really good after my workout and I've already noticed I'm not as tired even when my body is sore. I also like that no class is the same, sure you hop from rower to weights to treadmill, but the times are different and so are the moves at each station. They are big on HIIT, (High Intensity Interval training), here so you'll establish a base for yourself, then push, then back to base, then all out, then back to base kind of thing. There is a big monitor on the wall that shows you where you're at based on the heart monitor you're wearing. 

So if I like it why the four stars then? Price. It's expensive. If you work for a hospital or school you can get a $10 discount, but a month of unlimited classes is still $150 plus you have to buy their heart monitor (other ones don't work with their system if you care about being on the screen in class) which is $106 including tax or $5 each class to rent. They do have packages of 4 classes a month (but why bother) and classes of 8 a month for $99. The good thing is that they offer a 30 day guarantee. So if I take at least 12 classes a month and I am not satisfied then I get my money refunded. I have goal I want to reach by September so I signed up for 18 classes to start (plus I want my monies worth). 

They also have a strict cancellation policy so if you cancel less than 8 hours before your class then you will be charged $12 for that class on the unlimited plan or you will lose a class if you have one of the other plans (so 8 classes, miss one, now have 7 classes). I suppose this is incentive to show up! 

The other negative is the scheduling app. You can workout at any OTF but you can only get on the wait-list at your home location (place you signed up at). You have to call to be added to the wait-list. Then for classes you'd expect to see them all in one place but you have to toggle back and forth between the different locations as the classes are split up. This is annoying since I will be using the location by my work and the location by my home equally and would like to view all of my classes at once. Then there is an issue where you can't schedule classes on your own until a couple days after your billing cycle so you have to call in to be added to classes. This can be rough as classes the week of are usually full already. 

A long review but I hope it's helpful to those new to OTF!"
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"Man, what a disappointing  experience! Cranky review ahead. 

I stopped in a little before 6pm on a Monday to check out their Happy Hour. I thought a Monday would be more chill, but walking in you immediately notice how incredibly loud it is inside. Sure they were steady, but still plenty of empty tables in the dining room and I was only the fourth person at the bar (and three of them left within ten minutes of me arriving). The tables in the bar area must be the hot commodity as they were mostly filled up. Because of the noise level, this is probably not the best place for a date or if you want to relax with a drink. Maybe try later hours during the week and sit in the dining room. 

When I sat at the bar the bartender was MIA. The gentleman next to me was clanking his empty glass against the bar for what I assume was to get someone's attention (when the bartender finally came over he requested his bill and left). The bartender was clearly overwhelmed with filling drink orders for the tables so I made sure that when she got to me that I was ready. She gives me a frazzled hi and I place my drink order, she whirls around to make it, she drops it off so quickly I couldn't even finish saying thank you or tell her I wanted to place a food order. My stunned face gets the attention of the manager and he sends the bartender back over to me. 

*HH Rocky River Punch $5 - Not an appealing taste. Would not order again. 
*Basket of a round crusty bread with butter - complementary. I don't normally do bread and butter, but I decided to give it a try towards the end of my meal and realized the butter was sweet and tasty and I was a fool to pass this up at first! 
*HH Fried Green Tomatoes $6 - They did this up with some andouille sausage and a Cajun cream sauce. Did not seem like enough sauce so the friendly gentleman who brought out my food was kind enough to get me a little side of sauce. So glad he did because it was tasty and perfect for dipping bread into! 
*HH Lobster and Chive Risotto $6 - I had a couple bites and it was pretty good, but I was tired of the loud atmosphere and bad service so I asked for a to-go box. I always box my food up myself, once I get the plate I don't want others touching it and taking it out of my sight. The bartender told me that I could not box it up myself as they don't keep boxes at the bar and she would need to take it to the back and do it herself. I said okay, I'll just ask the manager to get me a box. She makes a comment to the manager and he comes over and I tell him I just want to box up my food. He offers to do it for me and I have to repeat that I want to do it. He takes 30 seconds to grab me a box and again offers to box up my food. WTF?! Why do I have to repeat myself to many times? Why is it so hard/such a big deal to honor a patron's very simple request? (Side note, I ate the leftover risotto the next day and it was still good). 

Service from the bartender never improved. She was not personable at all. She never stopped to ask how I was doing or if I needed anything, it's like I was invisible. I'd have to grab her attention just for a glass of water (that was never refilled). Don't even bother trying to ask for black pepper for your dish. Did you have a question about the menu? Too bad. I get that she probably felt busy and couldn't handle her workload, but maybe reach out to your manager to get you some help? I was like an inconvenience to her night at work instead of a welcomed addition to her paycheck. You work in the service industry, why would you treat your customers so poorly? Especially at a nicer restaurant in Rocky River. I was in and out of there in record time. 

Listen, I understand servers get busy and I honestly would not have minded if this lady had been the least bit pleasant and given me a friendly greeting or said ""hey I'm sorry tonight is crazy/we're short staffed (whatever excuse) but I'll be with you as soon as I can"" or ""thanks for being so patient"".  If she had taken just one minute to check on me and make sure I was doing okay it would have changed things to a more positive experience. Actually, I can't even really blame the bartender that much, the manager who was standing around should have taken it upon himself to go around and ask guests if they were doing okay and if they needed anything instead of waiting to be called over for issues. He should have jumped in and helped with the drink orders so his employees could provide better service. What does this business do when they have a full house?

I did like the food and the guy who brought it out to me was nice so I would give this place a second chance, but they really left me with a bad first impression with their lack of good service."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"I've tried all kinds of things to get active: Zumba, yoga, Barre, 5k's, rowing, Elite Hops, 10,000 steps a day, even tried a hula hoop class, but it's OTF that clicked with me. I joined about four months ago and I average 4 classes a week. 

So what is OTF? It's basically an hour long group workout class where you do HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training). You get time on the rower, the treadmill, and on the weight floor. You wear a heart monitor and your stats are posted on a big tv in the class so you can see what zone you are in (Gray/blue - just being alive/warming up. Green - comfortable base for working out. Orange - uncomfortable/you're really putting in effort. Red - watch yourself/over doing it.) You start each class with warming up for a couple minutes, then you get in the workout, and end with a couple minutes of stretching. After class you get emailed a summary of your workout. 

The gimmick for OTF is that if you get 12 splat points (12 minutes in the orange zone) then your body will keep burning calories for up to 36 hours after the workout. The scientific articles I've read said the calories burned after is minuscule unless you're a super athlete, but whatever motivates you. I think people get motivated by seeing their stats and pushing to do better or seeing the stats of others and having a secret competition against them that only they know about. I know I'm a mix of both. Listen, I've never taken an easy class. They all are tough and some I barely survive, but when I am drenched in sweat and smelling a little ripe, it feels good knowing I did that workout. I pushed my body. The weight isn't going to fall off of you unless you change your diet, but you will notice that you can lift heavier weights, or go from power walking to jogging, or you might even notice your clothes fitting differently and can see some muscle starting to form under all that subcutaneous fat. OTF makes me want to have a healthy fit body. 

Don't let OTF intimidate you. Your first class is free so come in and try it out. Yes you will see some in-shape people killing it, but there are all kinds of bodies (old, young, big, small, female, male) and there is no shame at all in doing what you can. The coaches are supportive and will give you options for the exercises. I actually cried once in the beginning out of frustration because I was comparing myself to the super humans, but a coach told me that I am doing the best for me at this point in time. Everyone has to start somewhere! 

Speaking of coaches, I think Becky is my favorite. She is really personable and approachable. This is probably a trick though to get you to take her class because they are always the hardest. You're like ""oh yay, Becky!"". Smiles. Then the workout starts and you start feeling the hate. Sarah is a little intimidating, but I'm warming up to her. She gives me nods when I'm doing something correctly on the weight floor and claps her hands to motivate you to push more. I think Emily is the head coach and she comes across really nice, but I bet she could rip you apart. She's more focused on getting splat points. As for the desk staff, I really like the ones who take the time to learn your name and give you a friendly hello when you come in or are just pleasant and helpful in general, makes going to the gym a better experience. 

So why not 5 stars? It is a bit pricey. I pay $149 a month with a $10 discount for unlimited classes a month. You can get discounts depending on your occupation. The heart rate monitor I had to buy was like $100. If you forget your HR monitor you have to pay to use one at the desk. If you cancel a class with less than 8 hours notice you have to pay $12. They do have cheaper plans if you only want 4 or 8 classes a month. (Honestly though, the high price makes me want to go as often as I can to get my monies worth and not cancel classes. Besides, ya'll have seen my Yelp account, if I can afford to go out to eat as much as I do then I can afford a gym class.)

I also don't like how you have access to any OTF location, but you have to call in to be added to the wait list for a class if it's not at your home studio. Supposedly this is going to be fixed in the app, but they have been saying that for a while. You also can't schedule classes through the app past your billing date. So like if today is the 4th and my billing date is the 5th I can't schedule classes for the 6th until my billing date hits. Classes can fill up fast so this is a problem, but you're allowed to turn in a sheet with up to 7 classes that they will schedule for you past your billing date. 

All in all I like it. It might not be for everyone but the important thing is to keep trying until you find an activity that keeps you from being a beached whale at home all the time with Netflix."
oAil_gYOXUhqWnKA8SwKsw,"The Verdict: 
Woo hoo! I saw a Cleveland food blogger talking about these tours a while ago and ever since it's been at the back of my mind lingering. I'm so glad I finally got the opportunity to take a tour! I'll tell you right now at the beginning of this review - the ticket price is up there, but if you can afford it I say go! I'm usually down for anything at least once especially stuff where you can sample a variety of things/do things you would not normally have done on your own. Everyone was friendly, I learned a little history, and I left with a very full belly.

The basics:
Asiatown Food Tours are an extension of Night Market Cleveland. These guided tours are $75. Last 3 hours (6pm - 9pm). Include food at 4 restaurants and drinks from Watershed Distillery. Tours happen once a month from April to October (private tours year round). Transportation by the West Side Shuffle. The restaurants differ each month and the selection is partly based on what specials/in season items are being offered so that those taking the tour get to try the best dishes at the time. They also try to set up stops so that you can try Chinese, Thai, Korean, Japanese, etc instead of all one type of cuisine. 

The Details:
The tour started out a bit rough. No one was really sure what spot to meet at in the Park To Shop plaza. Some people were late and this held up the group by 20 minutes which is unfair. Tours need to start on time. This means you show up 15 mins early so you're ready and we leave at 6pm. If you are not there on time then you have to meet us at the next stop. 

We boarded the old school bus and made our way to the first stop: Asia Food, Co. The building we arrived at actually houses several businesses (most of them closed for the day) like payroll services, dance classes, nail salon, massage parlor, restaurant, and the market. After a brief walk around we were set lose into the market. This was disappointing as I'm a basic white girl, I have no idea what most of these food items are. It would have been better if they split up the group and went over some things. What is this weird looking vegetable and how do you cook it? What junk food is really tasty that I should buy? What are your favorite sauces? At this point I was a little cranky about starting late and not eating anything yet. I've done food tours before and they all got you sampling food right away. I suggest eating a late afternoon snack before you take this tour so you're not as hangry. 

Back on the bus we were given little good bags with assorted packaged snacks like this seaweed thing, these tiny jello shot things, hard candies, a unique chocolate, a cracker. To me this is something you take home at the end of a tour. A green apple hard candy is not going to make me happy when it's dinner time and I'm hungry. 

During the brief bus rides we were told how this area used to be called Chinatown because of the Chinese immigrants trying to escape the war and looking for railroad work. They changed the name to Asiatown to be more inclusive of the variety of people living there. 

Our second stop was to Koko Bakery and things slowly started turning around. Since they were not able to provide us with the Watershed Distillery drinks this time around we were treated to bubble tea. We also got to sample a coconut cream bun (yum), a Chinese donut, and a pineapple bun (yum). We were supposed to sample a savory danish but for some reason there was not enough for the group. Poor planning/miscommunication/Idk? but I was cranky again for a minute until they brought out samples of this deli sub (yum) for the rest of us. 

Our third stop was Szechuan Cafe and this really made things better. It was a sit down restaurant were we shared several spicy dishes family style (love me a Lazy Susan). We feasted on savory hot sliced fish, cumin lamb, Ma Po Tofu, vegetable Ho Fun noodle, rice, and this fried chicken thing? OMG everything was so good! It was wonderful to be able to try so many things! I definitely would not have ordered fish, lamb, tofu, or this heat level on my own but seriously everything was so tasty! A tiny negative, one of our dishes was taken away and given to another table who ate theirs already. This was disappointing because we wanted to keep eating it, especially those who took a small sample to try on the first pass. 

Our last stop was in the same building and we were given a quick overview of the other businesses inside as we walked over to Li Wah. Again all of the other stores were closed for the day so it was more of a walk by looking through windows. At Li Wah we continued with sitting at a couple big round tables and dishes came out family style. There was jasmine tea, vegetable spring roll, peking duck bun, Chinese sausage fried rice, and sesame balls to sample. I was excited to try our last place, but at this point everyone was pretty full so it look longer to eat/things got boxed up to-go. Not as appreciative/interested due to food coma."
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Un excellent petit resto italien typique au centre ville. Le midi, il y a un choix de 6 plats italiens (penne, aubergines Parmigiana, escalope milanaise, etc..) pour 7,95$ chaque seulement!!
Vous pouvez aussi prendre un verre de vin maison, ainsi que des entrées (salade, soupe, etc.. menu indiqué sur l'ardoise, prix très raisonnables) et des desserts (choix de gâteau au chocolat, au Tiramisu ou cannoleni (les biscuits à la crème typiques!).
La bouffe est très bonne, c'est du vrai fait maison! Assiettes pas super copieuses si vous avez une grosse faim.
Le petit papi qui tient le resto est très gentil, on voit qu'il veut bien faire et fait son max pour que tout le monde soit content!
Seul petit hic, le prix du vin et des gâteaux n'étant pas affiché, on a été surprise par une facture autour de 20$ (alors que le plat est à 7,95..). Donc, il vaut mieux demander le prix avant si vous ne voulez pas de surprise!
Autre chose, les gâteaux sont assez lourds!
Bref, à essayer tout de même!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"J'hésitais entre 3 ou 4 étoiles, mais je vais mettre 3 à cause du service. Il y a quand même beaucoup de restos mexicains à Montréal, tous ont un service correct voir très bon, mais celui-ci est plus limité disons... En fait, si vous n'êtes pas pressé du tout, il n'y a pas de problème.
Notre serveuse (probablement la gérante aussi) était seule pour tout le resto ce soir là. On a voulu commander les boissons d'abord, mais elle nous a dit qu'elle prenait toute la commande au complet d'un coup..on a donc dû attendre un autre 15-20mn avant qu'elle revienne pour prendre notre commande complète. Des jeunes sont arrivés et se sont assis derrière nous, mais n'ayant eu aucun service pendant 10mn, sont repartis aussitôt.
Au niveau de la bouffe, c'était très bon, sauf les fajitas trop salées. La soupe de mais était bonne, et la salade de cactus aussi!
Prix corrects, vin maison correct
A la fin, on paie au comptoir
Bref, j'y retournerai sûrement, mais en sachant qu'il ne faut pas être pressé!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Excellent petit resto turc sur st Catherine, proche du métro Guy Concordia. Le resto ne paie pas de mine à l'intérieur mais quand on y entre, on se sent déjà dans une ambiance orientale. A l'entrée, il y a l'espace ""fabrication de pain"" par une dame qui a l'air turque, avec les outils et le four typiques. La déco (murs, tables, comptoir,..) est très typique aussi, tout est dans des tons chaleureux.
Au niveau de la bouffe, j'ai adoré mes mezze. Les feuilles de vignes (au boeuf et végé) étaient excellentes, et le mezze aux aubergines et poivrons également. Mon collègue qui a pris le Manti a beaucoup aimé son plat aussi. Notre autre collègue, qui a pris le Iskander, a trouvé la viande un peu coriace, mais tout le reste (accompagnements, sauce) était bon. Le pain fabriqué sur place, arrive tout chaud et accompagne très bien les plats ou les mezze.
Nous avons également goûté à un vin turc très bon! (Le premier de la liste, à 42$)
Enfin, le service était très bien!
J'y retournerai certainement!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Quelle belle petite découverte!
Cette nouvelle place à brunch est vraiment réconfortante, dans un cadre en bois très paisible. Nous y sommes allées un samedi matin à 10h, il n'y avait pas trop de monde, ce qui change de beaucoup d'endroits pour bruncher à Montréal! Pas d'attente, pas de line up, pas de bruit,..
Nous avons eu le temps de jaser et nous pouvions nous entendre, tout en prenant le soleil qui venait de l'extérieur.
Au niveau de la bouffe, tous les plats sont à 16,75$ je crois. Nous avons opté pour les oeufs béné végé et classiques, et tous étaient très bons! Ils viennent avec 2 petits beignets de pomme de terre, très bons mais gras (of course!), et quelques petits fruits, ainsi qu'une mini salade.
On nous a également offert une petite souper en entrée, ainsi qu'une petite mousse (oeufs en neige?) en dessert.
Je dirais juste que ce n'était pas extra copieux, j'avais un peu faim 2h après..
Sinon, tout le reste était top, le cappucino était bon, service impeccable.. j'y retournerai!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Excellents types de brunchs revisités, qui changent des brunchs classiques, à prix très corrects. Un peu loin des places traditionnelles et connues (Plateau, Mile End,..), ainsi que du métro (Pie 9 à 20mn à pied, ou bus dont le 125 au coin Ontario et Pie 9), mais ça ne fait pas de mal de prendre une petite marche pour y aller.
L'endroit est très beau (déco, bois, etc..) et le service très bon (staff adorable!).
Nous y avons été un samedi matin (11h) et il n'y avait pas trop de monde, ce qui change aussi de beaucoup de places à brunchs. Ca permet de rester sans se presser et de profiter du calme.
Il y a des sofas dans l'entrée si on veut se poser pour relaxer ou prendre le café avant ou après le repas.
Nous avons testé la gauffre au gravlax de saumon et le canard avec foie gras, les 2 plats étaient vraiment délicieux!
Nous avons aussi pu avoir une petite omelette au fromage avec des fruits pour bébé (7$).
A note: pas de table à langer pour bébé...
A essayer! Vraiment une bonne place à brunch!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Très bon petit bistro français, situé près du Cabaret Lion d'Or sur Ontario 
Les produits sont frais et recherchés, les cuissons et présentations de plats sont à point
Le service a l'air très correct, notre serveur était sympa et drôle, mais certain(e)s avaient l'air moins sympa, voire peu heureux d'être là... (ça se voyait à leur visage et leur attitude)
En entrée, nous avions pris une salade au saumon fumé, mais finalement on a eu la salade sans saumon. Nous ne nous en sommes pas rendus compte car la betterave avait la couleur du saumon, alors on pensait que c'en était, et que c'était un type de saumon particulier, pas très fort au goût... bref, au final, le serveur s'est excusé pour la manque de saumon, car on ne l'avait pas prévenu en cuisine... finalement, il nous a offert une autre entrée pour goûter, ce qui est sympa!
Le plat était très bon (steak frites pour mon ami et omble chevalier pour moi) et le dessert aussi (crème brûlée excellente!)
Ambiance chic, affaires ou amis, couples,..
A essayer!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Service client lamentable. J'ai appelé 10 jours avant pour réserver, on m'a dit qu'il fallait appeler 2 jours avant le jour de la réservation. Je rappelle 2 jours avant et je n'arrive à parler à personne de toute la journée, perdant énormément de temps sur la ligne. Je rappelle la veille et on me dit que le système informatique est down, alors on prend mes infos en me disant qu'on va me rappeler le soir même ou le lendemain matin. Le lendemain matin, n'ayant toujours pas été rappelée, je rappelle et on me dit qu'il n'y a plus de place pour la journée (du moins pas avant 17h30, ce qui ne nous convient pas). On décide de se présenter pour voir sur place, et je me fais presque envoyer promener en disant qu'il n'y a pas de place et qu'on me l'a dit au téléphone.
Bref, au final ça vient de scrapper notre journée et la fête de notre ami. Je suis vraiment fâchée et si un manager lit cette review je l'invite à prendre note que son organisation est pourrie.
Pour les autres, je vous suggère de boycotter cette place où on se fout totalement de votre gueule."
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Ok je mets 3 étoiles car j'ai eu une expérience moyenne et je trouve les prix des plats vraiment dispendieux pour ce que c'est et même par rapport à la quantité..
Nous y étions un mardi soir, il n'y avait pas trop de monde, c'est un apportez votre vin donc c'est cool
Par contre, mon plat (rognons de veau) n'était plus disponible, et le reste de la carte en plats principaux ne me tentait pas vraiment (ribs, boeuf, raviolis, tartare de saumon); et bien il faut savoir que dans ce cas, vous devez prendre 2 entrées minimum, sinon ça ne passe pas au niveau du apportez votre vin
Service très moyen, la serveuse m'a presque envoyée promenée parce que je demandais si je pouvais prendre 1 entrée + 1 cornet de frites, et elle me disait que non, je devais en + prendre une autre entrée.. Bref finalement le manager a réglé le problème, mais honnêtement ça m'a vraiment refroidi au niveau du service, ayant moi-meme déjà travaillé dans la restauration, et sachant que le resto n'était pas plein du tout...
Bref; j'espère que vous aurez une meilleure expérience que moi!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Je vais être critique sur ce resto car je fais beaucoup de restos en ce moment et celui-là n'a pas été à la hauteur de mes attentes, malgré que ce soit un haut de gamme au centre ville.
Le service a été particulièrement long, il a fallu re-commander à une 2e personne car nous n'étions pas sûrs que la 1e ait pris notre commande, nous avons attendu 45mn nos huitres (ok nous étions 3, mais quand même, pour un mercredi soir ça n'aurait pas dû être si long), nous avons dû demander à plusieurs reprises de l'eau, du pain, la bouteille de vin que nous avions commandé 20mn + tôt..C'est sûr qu'idéalement, on voulait boire notre vin avec nos huîtres..
Nous sommes partis ailleurs après les huîtres car les plats offerts sur le menu étaient assez dispendieux, pour des choses assez banales.. et ça ne nous tentait pas d'attendre encore 1h pour la suite
Seuls points positifs: les bouteilles de vin sont abordables (à partir de 35$) et les serveuses sont quand même souriantes (sauf une qu'on avait l'air d'ennuyer à redemander de l'eau..)
Bref, nous n'y retournerons pas."
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Le gym est à 2 pas de chez moi, ce qui est super pratique pour se motiver! (pas d'excuse du genre ""je sors pas il fait trop froid"" ou ""j'ai pas envie de marcher.."" :D)
Personnellement, je fais de la course sur tapis, de l'elliptique et des cours en salle, et je suis toujours satisfaite de mes visites. C'est sûr qu'il n'y a pas de coach ni de vrais profs pour les cours, mais moi ça me convient (suffit de s'auto-motiver! ;) )
Il y a souvent du monde, surtout le soir en semaine
Le staff est sympa et aidant
L'endroit est toujours propre, mais j'imagine que c'est parce que c'est assez récent aussi...
Les machines sont neuves, mais certaines (surtout des tapis de courses) sont déjà brisées :(
Bref, si vous habitez le quartier, ça vaut la peine, surtout pour aussi peu que 10$ par mois!! (au fait, avec l'inscription on vous offre 15mn de massage en chaise et 15mn de massage allongé par l'eau - je ne me souviens plus du nom, c'est la pression de l'eau dans le matelas qui vous masse, très agréable! si ça vous plait, vous pourrez upgrader votre forfait au Platine et avoir l'accès illimité! :) )"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Nous y sommes allé dans le cadre de Montréal à table, et la bouffe, ainsi que le service, étaient impeccables. En entrée, nous avons essayé le foie gras (avec un extra de 7$), vraiment très bon, servi dans un petit pot sous forme de ""tartinade épaisse"", et la croquette de rillette de porcelet, vraiment très bonne!
Ensuite, nous avons goûté le tartare, qui manquait un tout petit peu de goût (pas assez relevé), mais très bon tout de même, et le flan de porc, excellent! Ce dernier servi avec une petite purée sucrée vraiment bonne!
En dessert, nous avons goûté la crème brûlée (n'est pas dans le menu, est disponible seulement en cas d'allergie), et le financier au chocolat, vraiment bon mais lourd en fin de repas! Je n'ai pas pu le finir!
Les vins au verre sont entre 10 et 12$; il y a aussi beaucoup de choix de bouteilles de vins, et des cocktails.
Au niveau du service, c'était vraiment aux petits soins, on n'avait pas besoin de redemander de l'eau, ce qui est appréciable et pas toujours le cas au resto! Et on nous demandait souvent si tout était correct.
En tout cas, vraiment un très bon resto, je recommande!!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Si vous avez envie de bouffe espagnole, pas mal proche de ce qu'on trouve en Espagne, à Montréal, ne cherchez plus! Le club espagnol EST la place que vous cherchez! :)
Les tapas sont au top, les paellas aussi, les prix sont très corrects au vu de la qualité de la bouffe et de l'excellent service.
J'ai essayé les champignons à l'ail, le chorizo, le poulpe (hummm!!! servi en lamelles fines, sur des lamelles de pommes de terre), les patatas bravas, et d'autres tapas qui étaient tous délicieux, je n'ai pas été déçue!!
Il y a aussi du vin et de la bière, à prix corrects
Les samedis soir d'hiver, il y a soirée flamenco où il y a du monde.
En semaine, surtout l'hiver, vous pouvez appeler pour réserver des tables pour les groupes, il y a de la place en masse.
Accessible en bus sur St Laurent, ou en auto (stationnements payants trouvables sur St Laurent, gratuits un peu plus rares...), plus difficilement (du moins, il faut marcher) pour s'y rendre en métro.
L'été, il y a une superbe terrasse en arrière!
Attention, paiement en cash only! D'ailleurs, les prix sont taxes incluses! (car c'est un club social et non un business)
A essayer à tout prix! ;)"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"J'ai hésité entre 3 et 4 étoiles, pour 3 raisons;
- La première, c'est que je trouve les prix un peu dispendieux (cocktails à 14$, verre de vin à 13$, bouteille ou canette de bière entre 9 et 13$). 
- La deuxième, c'est qu'il n'y avait que 2 choix de vin (que du blanc, il n'y avait plus de rouge), et il n'y avait plus non plus de bière en fut. En somme, ça vous force un peu, à prendre un cocktail (ou du sake..). 
- Enfin, l'endroit n'est pas souvent ouvert, et quand il l'est, ça ouvre à 17h..dommage pour le monde qui finit vers 16h dans le coin, il faut attendre!
Sinon, bel endroit, beau cadre! C'est très sombre, ambiance tamisée, chaleureuse, belles décorations. Les sièges sont confo, les tables et chaises sont toutes un peu différentes. Le service était bon aussi, poli et notre serveur nous a bien répondu aux différentes questions que nous avions sur le menu. 
Nous avons essayé les edamame, qui étaient très bons.
Enfin, il n'y a pas de musique trop forte, on s'entend parler, et ça c'est rendu de plus en plus rare j'ai l'impression! Alors ça fait du bien!
Bref, à essayer, mais perso je n'irai pas tous les soirs car c'est un peu dispendieux."
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Excellent petit resto, à la formule originale! Il y a soit des dégustations du chef (5, 7 ou 9 services), soit une tâble d'hôte, avec large choix d'entrées et de plats (prix en fonction des entrées et des plats).
Service excellent, irréprochable.
Nous avons pris les tables d'hôte. Mon amie a pris les gnocchis en entrée puis le carré d'agneau comme plat principal, et les 2 étaient très bons. Pour ma part, j'ai pris le croustillant de chèvre en entrée, qui était délicieux. J'ai été un peu déçue par mon plat par contre: j'ai pris le tartare de saumon, étant une adepte des tartares de saumon!! Et malheureusement, ce n'est pas le meilleur que j'ai mangé :( Je l'ai trouvé trop gras à mon goût (salade en dessous avec beaucoup de sauce et petites frites très grasses sur le dessus), et fade; il ne goûtait quasiment pas le saumon (je me suis même demandé si le saumon était bien frais?). Ce qui était cool par contre, c'est que le tartare venait sous cloche, où il venait d'être enfumé de bois d'érable, ce qui lui donnait un petit goût original de fumé au début.
En tout cas, je ne m'arrêterai pas à cette déception et j'y retournerai pour goûter à la pieuvre!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Janine ressemble beaucoup à sa grande sœur Régine!
Pour ceux qui connaissent l'excellent et très renommé brunch Régine dans le coin de Beaubien, vous ne serez pas déçus de Janine, au contraire! Les plats sont tous aussi variés et originaux, et délicieux!!
Nous avons goûté le plat du jour avec option ""oeufs écossais"", et ça en valait vraiment le détour! Nous avons aussi pris le Croque matante et le pain aux courgettes, et avons également été emballés par ces choix.
Les drinks sont tout aussi bonnes et originales (déco sur les cafés, et même sur le Bloody Cesar!!), sauf le jus d'orange pressé que j'ai trouvé un peu amer.
A savoir! Ne venez pas en groupe! Le mieux est de venir entre 2 et 4. Au delà de 4, c'est difficile. Il y a juste 1 table pour 6, alors vous risquez d'attendre longtemps (nous avons attendu 2h pour une table de 7).
Ce qui est cool, c'est que pendant le line up, on vous offre de la brioche et du thé au jasmin. Et si vous êtes à l'extérieur, on vous prête une couverture pendant que vous attendez!
Le service était exceptionnel, nos 2 serveurs gars étaient absolument géniaux! Très polis, souriants et blagueurs!
Bref, Janine café est un MUST TRY!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Concept vraiment original de cuisine moléculaire
Ça vaut le coup d'essayer une fois pour voir et goûter, car plus qu'un resto, c'est toute une soirée et tout un spectacle!
A votre arrivée, on vous suggère d'aller au bar voir comment se préparent les cocktails moléculaires; le barman est vraiment bon et dynamique, il offre un spectacle vraiment extraordinaire et envoûtant! D'ailleurs, ça peut créer des liens entre toutes les personnes qui sont au bar et sourient devant le spectacle
Les cocktails sont vraiment bons et pour le moins originaux!
La bouffe était correcte mais pas ""si moléculaire"" que ça, nous étions un peu déçus. Il y avait juste un nuage de mousse et un truc qui crépitait en bouche. Ce n'était pas exceptionnel niveau bouffe et surtout au niveau de la quantité, c'était assez décevant. Nous avions encore faim après entrée, plat et dessert, tellement les portions étaient petites...
Au niveau du prix, c'est aussi décevant car les prix sont vraiment exhorbitants (comptez minimum 80$ par personne, voir 150 si vous voulez boire un cocktail ou boire à table).
Il y a la possibilité de prendre des groupons, mais ça reste cher quand même
A essayer pour une occasion, une fois"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Ce bar, situé sur Laurier a environ 10-12mn à pied du métro, est très petit et cozy. Nous y sommes allés pour un 5@7 après le travail, et nous étions tout au fond, à une place confo et nous tenions à 7. 
Seul hic de la soirée et je dois le noter car je trouve que c'est important: au fond du bar se trouvent les toilettes, dont la porte donne directement sur le bar. Malheureusement pour nous, une femme y est allé pour faire sa grosse commission et honnêtement, ça a été très déplaisant pour nous pendant une bonne quinzaine de minutes. Je me suis personnellement éclipsée à l'entrée du bar car je ne supportais plus l'odeur. Je dirais que ce point là est très gênant, il devrait au moins y avoir une aération au niveau des toilettes ou alors un spray pour les odeurs...
A part ça, le service était ok mais un peu lent, alors qu'il n'y avait pourtant pas de monde au début..
Les cocktails étaient délicieux et originaux, mais pas très ''grands'' (tout petits verres - idem pour le vin..)
Autre point à noter: il y a de la pizza ''maison'' (grand pizza carrée) pour les clients, gratuite!
Je pense que le bar est pas mal pour un petit groupe de collègues ou d'amis (max 7 pers.), ou une date!
A essayer!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Nous y sommes allés un jeudi soir, mon ami et moi. Lui connaissait déjà le petit Alep, moi seulement de nom.
Je dois dire que j'ai été contente, mais déçue du service. Le serveur était du genre contrariant et contrarié toute la soirée, à me conseiller de faire ci ou ça, mais si je ne suivais pas son conseil (j'ai le droit, non??!) il s'offusquait.. Du genre, je vous conseille de commander tout de suite des entrées et des plats, alors que je me connais je sais que je ne mange pas beaucoup, et je voulais attendre de voir à quel point j'avais encore faim avant de commander d'autres entrées ou plats.. Ensuite je lui demande si je peux garder un menu, il me dit ok mais finalement le prend (sans faire exprès), oublie de nous resservir de l'eau.. (je précise que je fais souvent des restos et c'est la 1e fois que j'ai le droit à un tel traitement, surtout à Montreal). Bref, j'étais au point et j'allais demander à changer de serveur si ça continuait.. une chance qu'en bonne compagnie, avec de la bonne bouffe, ça allait
La bouffe est délicieuse, les mazza sont terribles, et mon ami a bien aimé son plat de filet mignon épicé aussi
Prix du vin ok et qualité aussi
Bref, resto à essayer absolument!!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Bon... J'ai hésité entre 3 et 4 étoiles... Je mets 4 car le service est vraiment parfait, et l'endroit est très beau... Mais sinon, le rapport qualité-prix de la bouffe ne vaut pas 4 étoiles selon moi... Le brunch est assez dispendieux pour les différentes options proposées... Salade mesclun, salade de fenouil, salade de betterave en entrée... ce ne sont pas des choix nobles ni recherchés... Suivi de burger ou bénédictines ou yogourt en plat principal... Ce n'est pas non plus transcendent.. A noter que le menu n'était pas à jour sur le site internet... Nous avions repéré des options intéressantes sur internet qui n'étaient même plus disponibles, nous laissant devant des choix très simples, peu recherchés..
J'ai trouvé ça exagéré pour 44 ou 54$ pour 2 ou 3 services!
Clairement, j'ai mangé un peu de saumon fumé en entrée puis un burger et des frites comme plat, pour 44$, en ajoutant mon café (les cafés sont à partir de 5$ pour un café filtre) puis les taxes et tips, je m'en suis tirée pour environ 70$ pour un brunch (!!) pas extraordinaire du tout.
En plus, on était sur la véranda dans un espèce de courant d'air, il ne faisait pas chaud.
Bref, je ne recommande vraiment pas ce brunch à Montréal... Il y a beaucoup d'autres brunchs qui valent beaucoup plus la peine!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Nous sommes allés à la cuisine d'Izza entre amis hier soir, dans le cadre d'Oystermania. Nous avions acheté des coupons et réservé une table d'avance, en spécifiant que nous avions des coupons pour les huîtres. D'ailleurs, nous avions réservé pour 3 et étions finalement 5, mais on a pu nous accomoder sans probleme, ce qui était vraiment appréciable!
L'accueil a été très agréable, on nous a placé à une table avec banquette très correct, il y avait déjà 3-4 tables assises, pas trop de monde ni trop de bruit
Nous avons pris des entrées à partager puis les huîtres
La bouffe était excellente, rien à dire!! Les entrées sont toutes plus savoureuses les unes que les autres, c'est vraiment des trucs dignes de restos, que vous ne trouveriez pas ailleurs
Par contre, le service laissait à désirer.. je ne sais pas si la serveuse était nouvelle ou lente, mais on devait toujours redemander les choses plusieurs fois, et elle n'avait pas l'air de se presser du tout... dommage, car à la fin c'était assez pesant.. on est entrés vers 19h20 et repartis vers 23h, tout ça pour manger quelques huîtres... c'était vraiment long... une chance qu'on n'était pas trop pressés et en bonne compagnie
A part ça, beau décor, ambiance sympa, bonne bouffe, le gérant est super sympa aussi, je le recommande!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Alors j'ai hésité entre 3 et 4 étoiles, je vous explique pourquoi!
Nous avons appelé pour réserver pour 9 personnes un dimanche matin, mais on nous a dit qu'on ne prenait pas de réservation. Nous sommes alors arrivés vers 11h, et on nous a pris notre nom en nous disant que ça serait un peu long. Nous avons donc décidé d'aller prendre un café à côté en attendant, en demandant de se faire rappeler.
1h après, nous sommes allés voir où c'était rendu, et on nous a dit c'est bon, dans 5mn vous avez une table. On a encore attendu un bon 20mn dehors... Puis ça a été long avant de commander, et très long aussi avant d'avoir nos plats (presque 1h).. Au final, nous sommes arrivés à 11h et repartis après 14h.
Donc je dirais simplement que cet endroit n'est pas fait pour les groupes de plus de 4-6 personnes. Il faudrait que ça soit plus clair au téléphone ou écrit quelque part sur Yelp ou leur site.
L'endroit n'est pas immense, et il y a surtout des tables de 2 ou de 4. Le serveur avait l'air de dire que certaines tables, bien qu'à côté, ne sont pas ''rapprochables''.
La bouffe était très bonne, le choix est quand même vaste, les prix sont très raisonnables. Le service était OK bien que long.
Le smoothie du jour aux bleuets, banane, était délicieux. Les crepes aussi étaient très bonnes.
Bref, j'y retournerai volontiers, mais pas en groupe ;)"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Superbe découverte, ce petit resto sur Masson!
Nous y sommes allées dans le cadre de Montréal à table, et avons été enchantées de notre repas
En entrée, la crème de champignons est en réalité plutôt comme une émulsion de champignons, on dirait une mousse légère, excellente! Les papitas étaient un peu décevantes, j'ai trouvé qu'elles manquaient un peu de goût.
En plat principal, nous avons toutes les 2 pris la tentacule de calamar géant, qui était vraiment bien cuisinée, avec de délicieux accompagnements
Comme dessert, j'ai pris le pouding pain qui était très bon, avec son coulis de caramel à la fleur de sel, et mon amie a pris la mousse de dulce de leche, qui là encore était comme une émulsion légère, vraiment très bonne!! Les deux desserts venaient avec des petites miettes de croustillants chocolats, qui rajoutaient une petite touche
Le seul hic je dirais, c'est que nous avions réservé pour 20h30, mais on ne pouvait pas rentrer dans le resto tant que les gens du service d'avant n'étaient pas partis... ils se sont tous un peu fait mettre à la porte vers 20h25, et nous avons pu rentrer vers 20h35... disons que avoir su, nous ne serions pas arrivées d'avance pour attendre dehors au froid
Aussi, à noter, le resto est tout petit! donc je pense que c'est mieux de réserver pour être sûr d'avoir une place, et pour les groupes, je pense que max 8 convient...
En tout cas, je le recommande fortement!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Le Toqué n'a plus de réputation à se faire, il est nommé parmi les meilleurs restaurants au Canada chaque année (souvent le 2e meilleur même!).
Nous y sommes allés un midi pour l'essayer. Nous avions réservé pour 11h30, heure d'ouverture. Cela permet d'éviter le rush de midi..
Le service est bien évidemment impeccable, on vous accueille par des Mme/Mr et votre nom, on vous prend votre manteau pour le mettre dans un grand placard en guise de vestiaire, puis on vous installe à votre table. Pour les dames, il y a des crochets pour accrocher le sac à main à votre table.
Au début, on vous sert 2 sortes de pain: du pain frais et des croûtons, avec du beurre. Le pain frais ne m'avait pas l'air si frais, il était un peu sec selon moi. Les croûtons étaient très bons.
Au niveau des plats, nous avons essayé en entrée, la soupe de topinambour et le gigot d'agneau à la rémoulade puis, en plat principal, les agnolotti ainsi que la raie. 
Entre chaque plat, on vous passe le ramasse-miettes bien sûr.. 
Dans l'ensemble, nous avons tout trouvé très bon, très savoureux, et très bien présenté également. Le service a été rapide, car nous avions demandé en réservant, de pouvoir manger en 1h max, ce qui a été respecté.
Le seul petit hic que nous avons trouvé, et que j'avais déjà entendu dire au niveau du Toqué, c'est au niveau des quantités, qui ne sont pas des plus copieuses... Si on regarde mon assiette de raie, il y a 2 petites ailes de raie, et peu d'accompagnements..
Mais bon, dans l'ensemble, ce fut une très bonne expérience!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Le resto est, cette année, 8e au classement des meilleurs restos au Canada. Nous avons donc voulu l'essayer avec mon amie!
Je vous le dis tout le suite, le resto mérite largement cette place au classement!
Le service est impeccable, aux petits soins, surtout par un homme qui, je pense, est le gérant. Nous avons vu passer 2 ou 3 serveurs (celui qui prend les commandes, un autre qui apporte les plats et les explique), tous étaient très gentils et polis. Celui qui explique les plats expliquait un peu vite ceci dit, et le menu n'est pas super clair, on était un peu mélangées et on ne savait pas très bien qu'est ce qui était en format entrée, en plat, etc.. tout est pas mal en vrac sur la feuille du menu, et il y a peu de détail au niveau de la forme, des accompagnements, etc..
Mis à part ça, la bouffe était excellente! Les tartares de cerf et d'agneau étaient exquis, le topinambour + fromage aussi, et le volcan de crabe également (assez salé tout de même)
J'étais un peu déçue par le dessert ""chocolat-nougat-caramel"", que j'ai trouvé cher pour ce que c'est (10$ les 3 morceaux), et le chocolat était en réalité fourré de caramel.
Il manque un dessert au chocolat dans la carte des desserts, qui est assez riche (beaucoup de choix variés, de mignardises à des plus gros desserts).
Facture très correcte pour ce genre de resto, j'ai pris 1 bière, 1 cidre, 2 plats et la moitié du dessert, le tout pour 65$!
Excellent rapport qualité-prix.
A noter que si c'est votre fête, on vous fait toute une cérémonie avec musique, chapeau, etc!! Vraiment drôle à voir (il y avait 3-4 fêtes pendant que nous étions là).
J'y retournerai certainement pour essayer d'autres plats!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Pas mal, mais pas ""wow""
J'ai hésité entre 3 et 4 étoiles
L'endroit est quelconque, il n'y a pas spécialement de déco. Le service a été très bien pour nous, notre serveur était très gentil, blagueur et attentionné. 
Par contre, nous étions étonnés des choix assez ""banal"" des plats principaux, pour ce resto dit ""haut de gamme"". Bavette, moules, tartare de saumon... autant de choix classiques, aux accompagnements tout aussi classiques (frites, purée, carottes,..).
Nous souhaitions opter pour le menu 5 services à 55$, mais au début on nous a dit qu'on ne pouvait l'avoir seulement pour la bavette et le tartare de saumon. On n'a pas très bien compris pourquoi, mais bref finalement on a pu prendre le poisson du jour dans le menu dégustation.
Au final, le menu dégustation comprenait 2 entrées, 1 trou normand, 1 choix dans les plats principaux, et un dessert.
Les entrées: velouté de champignons, fish cake et foie gras, étaient délicieuses. Le 6$ d'extra pour le foie gras m'a paru un peu exagéré, car la portion n'était pas énorme.
Ensuite, les plats étaient très bons (bavette et morue), mais pas wow non plus. 
Les desserts, notamment celui au chocolat, étaient très bons.
Nous avions également pris une bouteille de vin excellent, le 3015, à 45$ la bouteille.
Seulement, à la fin, on s'en tire avec une facture de 200$ pour 2, avec le vin et les extras, ce que je trouve beaucoup pour le rapport qualité/prix. Je n'ai pas trouvé que ça valait ce prix là. De plus, mon conjoint a été malade cette nuit, et nous nous sommes alors questionnés sur la fraîcheur de sa bavette.
Bref, c'était bien comme 1e expérience mais je ne pense vraiment pas que nous y retournerons."
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Nous y sommes allés un samedi soir (12.11) pour le resto + le club. 
- Nous avions réservé pour 21h30 et on nous avait bien précisé qu'il fallait être à l'heure car sinon, si on avait plus de 5mn de retard, on donnait notre table à quelqu'un d'autre. Finalement, à 21h30, la table n'était pas prête, et nous avons du attendre jusqu'à 22h.
- Pour s'excuser, on nous a offert 1 verre chacun, ce qui était apprécié
- Une fois qu'on a eu notre table, le service a été trèèès long... Nous avons eu l'entrée vers 22h30 puis le plat principal vers 23h30 me semble.. vraiment long, nous n'en pouvions plus d'attendre..
- Pour s'excuser, on nous a offert 1 shooter chacun, ce qui était apprécié
- Vers minuit et demi, nous avons terminé (enfin!) puis commencé à tester la piste de danse. Nous avons aimé l'ambiance, la configuration de l'endroit et la musique. Par contre, il n'y avait pas trop de place, les gens étaient tout le temps en train de circuler, les serveurs aussi, ce qui fait qu'on est tout le temps dérangé quand on est en train de danser.. à moins de prendre une table à 900$ la bouteille bien sûr..
Il y a aussi une 2e salle avec quelques plantes au plafond (j'étais un peu déçue, je m'attendais à plus de plantes que ça quand on m'avait dit qu'il y avait une super déco de plantes de type jungle). Cette salle fait seulement bar et endroit pour danser nous a t il semblé. Bonne musique aussi et les gens paraissaient un peu différent que dans la salle principale (en mieux..).
Bref, avis mitigé, je sais que c'est LA place à la mode mais peut etre parce qu'il n'y a pas beaucoup de choix non plus pour manger puis clubber dans le centre ville?! En tout cas, je n'ai pas été émerveillée..."
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Bon... je vais être franche avec vous, j'ai été un peu déçue de mon expérience à Pocha de Marie. Après avoir lu de super commentaires de Yelpeurs et vu la note moyenne de 4,5 / 5 étoiles, je m'attendais à quelque chose de super.... ce qui ne fut pas le cas :(
Déjà, le cadre n'est pas terrible, aucune déco, aucune ambiance, on se croirait presque dans une cantine.
Ensuite, l'accueil du serveur (manager?) ne fut pas des plus agréables, plusieurs fois j'ai eu l'impression qu'on le 'gonflait' car nous étions la seule table de ce mercredi soir (désolés!!!)
D'ailleurs, mon check in de Yelp n'a pas fonctionné, ce qui fait que ce même serveur ne voulait pas m'offrir l'entrée de kimchi comme c'était le cas pour mes amis.. j'ai trouvé ça un peu poche.. ce n'est pas de sa faute si l'appli ne marchait pas très bien, mais bon il voyait bien que j'essayais et que ça ne fonctionnait pas... On a finalement réussi à faire mon check in au bout d'un bon bout de temps, mais bon, il fallait être tenace et patient...
Pour nous faire patienter, on nous a apporté des raviolis (1 chacun), offerts par la maison (nice!)
Au niveau de la bouffe, il y avait casiment que des plats piquants, sans possibilités de diminuer le niveau de piquant... Alors les choix étaient quand meme assez restreints pour ceux qui n'aiment pas trop le piquant (dans d'autres coréens, il me semble que ya le choix?!)
Bref, moi j'aime le piquant, ça ne m'a pas dérangé, et j'ai pris le burger, qui était très bon!
Au niveau de la musique, c'était un peu bizarre aussi car il y avait un peu de tout, du latino, etc.. Mais bon, pourquoi pas..
A la fin, on ne se sent pas de rester, le cadre est froid et l'ambiance un peu morte..
Bref, ceci est mon expérience, j'ai hâte de lire les prochaines afin de pouvoir comparer.."
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Nous y sommes allés un dimanche matin et avons été clairement déçus.
Après avoir attendu 15mn en line up (ce à quoi nous nous attendions), nous avons été placés sur une grande table en bois, au milieu d'autres groupes. Jusque là, tout allait bien, le décor est beau et l'endroit est très spacieux. Seul hic: peut etre un peu trop de monde et de bruit, ça donne une sensation de rush avec les serveurs qui courent dans tous les sens.
Nous avions lus que les brunchs étaient délicieux et copieux. Nous avons pris 2 brunchs différents, et avons tous les 3 été déçus. Pour ma part, le brunch norvégien, avec soit disant du fromage de chèvre et du saumon fumé, comportait 2 petites tranches de pain (à l'encre de sèche), raclé de fromage de chèvre qui se sentait à peine, avec 2 minuscules tranches de saumon fumé; mes amis eux, qui avaient pris le brunch des Cantons, ont eu la même genre de mauvaise surprise: des assiettes peu copieuses et non originales, contrairement à ce que laisse entendre le menu. Je tiens à noter aussi que nous avons eu chacun 4 mini pommes de terre dans nos assiettes, ainsi qu'un peu de salade, sans sauce.. Moyen pour un brunch à 19$... En regardant l'assiette, on avait encore faim... 
Le 19$ comprend le brunch ainsi qu'un verre de jus d'orange, qui n'était pas excellent, et des petites mignardises, que nous avons dû demandé à la fin car on avait oublié de nous les amener... pas terrible...
Bref, quand on est venu me demander si ''ça allait'', je n'ai pas pu m'empêcher de m'exprimer. La serveuse a été compréhensive, nous a rapporté un petit bol de 8 mini pommes de terre pour compenser (c'est sûr que 8 de plus à partager, ça allait nous remplir!! ;) ) et ne nous a pas compté les cafés.
En tout cas, nous n'avons pas du tout compris quel était l'engouement des gens pour cet endroit, et une chose est sûre, nous n'y remettrons plus les pieds, et n'allons surement pas en faire de la publicité."
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"La nouvelle cabane d'à côté du Pied de cochon est vraiment intéressante!
Nous y sommes allés un samedi soir en groupe (14 personnes). Nous avions réservé il y a 6 mois, et avions bien hâte de tester la nouvelle cabane!
En arrivant, on nous propose de déguster des cocktails maison près du foyer en attendant notre table.. Les cocktails sont vraiment bons, nous avons goûté celui au thé glacé et celui au gin, tous 2 très bons. Petit hic, le foyer est proche de la porte d'entrée, qui est grande ouverte pour aérer, donc certains d'entre nous avaient un peu froid. Mais nous avons pu fermer la porte le temps de boire nos cocktails, alors ça allait mieux!
Quelques dizaines de mn plus tard, nous avons pris place à notre table (en fait nous avions 1 grand table et 4 places à la table de derrière, pour que tout le monde fit!!), ce qui était très bien.
Au niveau de la bouffe, c'était super bon du début à la fin, la petite mousse de foie gras en entrée, et la soupe au pois au foie gras étaient vraiment de belles découvertes. Les plats de viande également, et les desserts aussi :)
Tout était vraiment exquis et les portions très généreuses, c'était vraiment copieux, après 2 ou 3 plats nous étions tous plein, mais il restait encore beaucoup de choses!!!
Je mettrai un petit bémol au fait qu'on ne peut pas vraiment avoir de doggy bag, nous en avons demandé et obtenu 3, mais on nous a dit que ce n'était pas le concept de la cabane... Or cela se fait à la ''vraie'' cabane du Pied de cochon, et je trouve ça bien plutôt que de jeter la bouffe en trop... Et aussi, pour pouvoir goûter les choses qui ont l'air bonnes mais qu'on est plus capables de manger quand on est pleins! D'ailleurs, tout est très riche, gras, ce qui est normal pour une cabane à sucre, alors comme nous voulions goûter à tout, nous nous forcions et plusieurs d'entre nous (au moins 4) étaient malades le lendemain.. Il faut prévoir le coup en fait et ne pas manger de la journée avant d'y aller...
Sinon, il y a aussi de bons vins et de bons petits alcool (maison ou non) - eau de vie de poire, trou normand, etc.
Staff agréable, sympathique et souriant
Enfin, la facture est plutôt salée, mais on s'y attend en allant dans ce genre d'endroit..
A essayer!"
3aYeG-x5A44GIgmBHrwyAA,"Bon bon bon...
Nous avons vraiment vécu une expérience pourrie et en tant que Yelp Elite, je me dois de la relater ici.
D'abord, le bar étant caché, j'ai demandé au serveur du El pequeno (bar se trouvant juste au dessus du Coldroom) où il se trouvait. Celui-ci m'a répondu un peu sèchement, comme s'il en avait marre que tout le monde lui posait toujours la question. Il m'indique qu'il faut sonner à la porte.
Je sonne à la porte, et attends quelques minutes. Il faisait froid, donc au bout de 5mn environ, je resonne. Là, un jeune serveur arrive, ça avait vraiment pas l'air de le tenter de venir ouvrir la porte. Il me dit ''attends moi là''... OK. J'étais au téléphone (je pensais pouvoir finir mon appel dans l'entrée du bar, plutôt que dehors au froid, mais là j'étais prise avec le serveur fru, qui me demandait d'attendre en haut des marches). Il commence à descendre les marches, alors je dis à mon amie au téléphone, d'attendre car je ne comprends pas bien ce qu'il se passe, puis il me demande de le suivre dans les marches. Et c'est à ce moment-là, que j'entends le serveur dire ''les estis de français'', probablement par sa frustration que j'étais au téléphone, et qu'il a entendu que j'étais française.
Donc, je viens de me faire insulter en pleine face, ça commence bien.
Si ça n'avait tenu qu'à moi, j'aurais fait demi-tour, mais j'avais 2 amies qui m'attendaient en bas.
Le serveur m'accompagne en bas, et quand je rejoins mes amies, il nous mentionne que pour un groupe ''si grand que le nôtre'' (on devait être 6 max), il allait nous faire juste 1 facture (OMG je n'ai jamais vu ça à Montréal... mais ok...).
Nous étions assises au bar, alors on a demandé si on pouvait avoir une table plus grande, quand les autres amis arriveront. Au bout d'une demi-heure environ, il nous donne une table pour 4 (on se squeeze!). Puis, on voit une table plus grande se libérer, on lui demande si on peut y aller, mais non, c'est pour ... des groupes! Donc nous, on est un groupe pour payer une seule facture, mais pas pour avoir une grande table! 
Bref, mon amie commence à lui expliquer que c'est pas cool, qu'en plus il m'avait insultée dans l'escalier, mais le gars nous rit en pleine face!
Donc finalement, on a juste décidé de quitter, après avoir payé nos drinks et laissé 0 tips bien évidemment.
Mon amie qui allait souvent au coldroom, ma mentionnée qu'il y avait de moins en moins de monde, et franchement, au vue de ce service, ça ne m'étonne même pas. Même le barman était fru et désagréable. Aucun sourire tout le long qu'on était au bar, même pendant qu'on commandait ou lui parlait gentiment.
Bref, je ne remettrai pas les pieds dans cette place, et je vous encourage à en faire tout autant, il y a tellement de bars avec d'excellent service à Montréal!"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"The Brunch is amazing and if you have a coupon its 1/2 the cost. Be early if you plan on dining outside as there is a line by 11:15 on a Sunday. I will say watch and look at your bill. We had a 66.00 bill and I only glanced at the total as we were with guests. So I tipped on the total of 80.00 and put down a 20.00 tip. I later wondered why it was so high and realized they had already put a 20% tip on. so I would up giving a 35.00 tip on a 66.00 bill. Crazy. I did call but they only took off the lower tip of 14.00 which means I tipped about 32%. The waitress was ok, but not worthy of that in my books. I love the place but that left a bad taste in my mouth. If she had been at least friendly I would have said well it was her day, but we have had nice staff. Food wise the place is amazing and the atmosphere is wonderful. One of our favorite places to bring relatives when they come to visit"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, this places reserves a new review. I had complained because of the nit wits they had working there and they seemed to listen to my complains. Now they are staffed with young and hard working young people. Good job. I was even impressed when we ordered a extra crispy pizza and i had been having a heated discussion  that the manage came over because he thought I was complaining about the pizza. But the time he came over we had forgotten our conversation and wondered why he came over and did not realized until later he probably though I was upset over the pizza. It was a little over crispy, but I asked for it that was and will take that over a soft crust any day.  So thank you for listening to our reviews and making the place a better place for us to enjoy. I do like a more crispy pizza and glad they are also listening to us when we request it. Next time I will just say crispy and we will be prefect."
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"I actually was a bit worried with one or two of the reviews but it was really good. the value is great and you get to try a whole bunch of new things. Loved the udon. I wish the shumi and the wantons were not fried but steamed but they were still good. We also asked for a plain tuna roll and they were happy to get it for us. The only thing I did not like is the you have to eat it if you order it. I think the rule is a good one but if you dont like somethign like the tornado roll we ordered because it was to doughy, I really wish I did not have to finish it. They say if you dont finish it you will be billed for it. But all in all the best thing was the bill , about half of what it woudl ave cost me. We did the lunch and cant wait to try the dinner. Was not keen on the guy who kept walking through, at least stop and say hello if you are going to Marshall the  place. The waitresses were so very nice. give it a try"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"This was our second tour. the host was super nice. Wish they had mentioned where we were to meet and not just an address. Thankfully the tour guide did call me as we were outside. Everyone on the tour wee super nice. Love the wine place, the Italian place was a bit disappointing as I was expecting a hot sample and they gave us chocolate. They said because of the wine but you don't eat dark chocolate with Rose. If you tell us you moved to the back so you could have a kitchen to cook and you sell items to cook, show us the sauce.  Mimosas was the best place as we were served on a plate as I think the tours shoudl be. The test of the paces were more of a hand out. Amalie's shoudl have given a variety as the one item cut in threes just did not show how great their items are. The taco place should have give one chicken and one fish as some people had no choice.  The best part was our host and enjoyed the walk around."
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, the soups are good but the pizza is so so. But the reason I will not be back is the staff. Really, who hires these girls. If I had a daughter looking for work, this would not be the place to send her.  They all seem to be a little ditsy playing bump butts while customers are in plain  site. They do more socializing than helping customers. And who is that guy who stands there watching them. I have no doubt he hired them the way he follows them as they walk the pizza out. But please, hire people who have half a brain and make your place look better, not worse.  I can't even believe they do not know what a carafe is. They answered ,..... we only have Chianti  and then they asked the man who does nothing but stare at the girls and he said, yes we only have red and white wine. It was funny, but not really in an Italian restaurant. I really do hope the restaurant reads these reviews and management needs to do something or close"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, so I decided to go after seeing these people on TV so many times. What they do not tell you and let me tell you before you go in, is that to lose 20 pounds the cost is 2500.00. If you pay now its 2 and if you want to lose 40 pounds the cost is 3500.00. It's all you own food which is good but then you have to take all these supplements and protein powders. I paid 30.00 for some contraction to tell me I was over weight. My scale at home told me the same thing. The place is empty except for receptionists. Let me tell you for 3500.00 I can send. You to a vacation resort for a week that will work you out and feed you healthy foods. Plus let me say that the doctor is a chiropractor , not a nutritionist . This felt m ore like a scam to me. I decided to do it myself the old fashion way by not eating so much. I think it's also funny the person who responded to THIs review is None other than the owner himself, writing as if he is a employee...hummmmm"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"I was a little wary on one or two bad reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. We went in for th lunch all you can eat and it was really good. The portions are small but you can ask for more or they ask you how many pieces. the only thing I had a problem with is they say if you order it you have to eat it. On almost eveythign this was great, and understandable. But one sushi roll, I think the volcano was very doughy and I was not a fan so I did not want to finish it but I woudl have been charged if we did not. I woudl perter the Shumi to be steamed, a lot of stuff like the dumplings were fried rather than steamed but next time I will ask. The best part of all was the bill, much less than it woudl have been elsewhere. The staff is super sweet. Loved the udon and we will be back to try the dinner. There was one guy who kept walking in and out. That was odd(if you going to check to makes sure all is well, ask the customers and say hello), but besides that everything was good"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"So far everything I have had has been great. I did find the pasta under cooked or left out and not warmed en ought and I say to myself how hard is it to make fresh angle hair pasta? I do it at home in like 5 minutes. So I think that needs to be looked into. The owner nicely said he just made it 30 minutes ago but I find that hard to believe and if he did why when you can cook it on the spot. . I guess I had more of an issue of him making it my problem and not that of the meal. The salmon was wonderful but the whole meal should be good. He did make me a new meal but by that time everyone in the place was looking at me as he yelled my issues over the room. But even with saying this I do find their food very good. Next time I will either not order pasta or make sure they know I want it fresh or cooked well. But anytime a piece of pasta has a kink in it, it was not just cooked. My suggestion to the place is to have a pot of boiling water and just make it to order. How hard is that?"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, I really like the cinema itself.  Its easy to get to and with a bit of luck you can find a spot to park. But I will say the last visit, yesterday was the worst popcorn we have ever had. I even lost a filling. Usually it s not as good as AMC so sometimes I go all the way to concord just for better  popcorn. But last night we got a big tub, its like over 10.00, maybe 15.00 and when my movie bill is about 100.00 to see a movie with my family I expect to get at least what I paid for. We go into the move and start eating. Whole corn kernels unpopped. Almost in every bit. Its was so bad and everyone said so I dumped it out and went up for my free refill thinking it must have been the bottom of the pooped corn. Nope, second one was just as bad. Plus why is there only one person working concession on a Sunday holiday night? i tried to find an address to write to the theatre but no luck. If it was 3.00 a bag, fine but with the cost of popcorn these days it should be the best we can get"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, I was so excited for this superstore to come to Cornelius. Now, not so thrilled. So far the veggies have been less than super fresh and the store seems confusing since the veggies are split from the rest of the store. Yes the sushi and bakery are also over there but if you forget something , good luck trying to get back. I purchased a piece of meat which when turned over was like allowed out on the underside. But I will give them this, they replaced it. Love the fact they have sushi but they don't have a many tasting as they Huntervillle store has. So far not super thrilled to say the least. The meats at least so far are better at Teeters. I asked if they could get Goodbelly at customer service and they looked at me like I had three heads. If Teeter can carry product and so can whole foods I cant see why Publix can't. I am still looking for that one store I can get everything in....and so far I don't see the savings they advertise yet. But I do like the no customer number  policy."
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, now I will say I liked Theresa and i even like the color she gave me. But for over 400.00 for a hair cut and highlights, wow, that is robbery. First when they make you sign an agreement to pay for a service because the price is outrageous, you already know they are overcharging you. The sad thing is I like the place , like the girl and would go back. But I moved from NY and CT and I have had my hair done  at Adam Broderick and frederic fekkai in NY and its had never cost as much as in Cornelius NC. 
The color also did not last and faded quite fast for 400.00.  Just saying I thought when i moved here I would never see another 250.00 hair bill. I was right. Its more. I will say to those who think it in with the times., I drive Porsche, own a home and still think that its high in any state, except maybe Hollywood. I wish I could use Theresa again but at  at that kind of price tag  to have my hair highlighted, I am sorry to say not. Really. Time for a reality check Modern salon and spa"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"ok, let me tell you the cook was amazing, the food great. What I don't like is we come in with a party of 6, at my suggestion to this place. We dine, have a blast and then I hand them a mailer coupon(I could not find the one from my mailer, so i printed it out on line) and the only reason i picked this place and they would not accept it. They have before but no longer. It's not like the coupon was for Cherry or another restaurant. But if you are going to ruin a person's meal by being cheap when you put these coupons out there, then people are going to go elsewhere. Had they  taken it and said, next time we will not be able to take it unless it the one from the mail, then ok. But the website allows you to print the coupon and then you get people in and bamm at the end you will not take your own coupon...no wonder you are empty on a Friday night.  Such a shame too because our chef was the best we have had in several visits. Shame on you Japan 49..that's how you lose customers..just like that ....gooonnnneeee"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, first let me start by saying the tacos were great. We went on a Saturday and were seated pretty quickly. We liked our waitress. What I did not like is we ordered a drink and then an hour later when the table across from us  sat and was eating in like 5 minutes I was wondering what was going on. Finally our waitress came and told us the kitchen pulled our order at the end instead of the beginning. So we waited and hour and 20 mintes to eat, bought more drinks because we were sitting there with a guest. So its was and additonal 40.00 in drinks and the waitness shoudl have compted us the second round of drinks. I really enjoyed the food but the fact that 6 tacos cost me about 100.00 becuase of the 5 drinks is crazy. It took us over 2 hours to eat and we only ate for about 15.00 miniutes.  I really wish the service had been better because it ruined the whole thing for me. Oh I had the salmon tacos and they were very tasty. I just hate having a whole night ruined by bad service...and I had to pay 100.00 for it hummm"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, we went back for a second time trying to be open minded since the first time was not a good experience. The drink at the bar, excellent. Best I have had in a while. The waitress this time was beyond sweet. My issue is the food. I had 4 scallops for 18.00 which were ok, no com plants there, but was it the best I ever had? hummmm not sure. The bread was good. 
then for my entree I had squid ink pasta and I think it was grilled shrimp. OK, no kidding, it was  one piece or a half a piece of shrimp cut into 3 portions for 20.00 and I might be off on the price somewhat. I thought it was so so. I would have loved to see some shrimp in the dish. I just don't get people waiting in line to dine here. I am thinking really really good advertising. We were right on time waited for 40/50 minutes to sit. Had to wait 10 deep for the toilet. Is ti a nice place, sure, but from the reviews you woudl think it would amazing. Sorry guys , I don't see it. I get it the IT place to go, but you money could be better spent around the corner"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, I am still trying to decide if I like them or not. I have had two good and two bad visits. Sometimes my gels last two weeks and sometimes not. Now the places is beautiful but I often feel they don't really like the customer. I had a mother daughter team and the mother gave me some odd vibes. She spoke in another language all the time to her daughter who then said her mother said she had big boobs(which she did not) and i was wondering if she was talking about me. So since I spent 120.00 to get my nails done with tip, I think I will try a few more places. I keep thinking back to the Seinfeld episode where they are all talking behind Elaines back and would rather not the the ridiculed client. since I don't understand and they chose not to speak English, i will look for a place that allows the clients to hear what they are saying.  Oh plus the mother filed down my nails way past what I woudl have liked. The problem of getting two things done at once and not paying attention. So wish I did not leave a 20.00 tip. Live and learn"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, since we lost our diner in Cornelius I was glad to see another. We enjoyed everything we ate. The only odd thing was someone, the manager maybe ? He came over and told us that the chicken pot pie my husband ordered was not up to their standard but we should enjoy it and he would bring another. The we can either eat it or take it home. Now had he not said that , we would have enjoyed it and not known any better, but since he did and no other chicken pot pie came  that was supposedly up to their standards, we felt  odd. Like did we just eat something that was not good. Plus I also think they brought him a small and not the large he ordered and paid for , but he did not need the larger portion anyway in my opinion. I just thought how odd to have such good customer service to come and say something like that and then then drop the ball. I even stopped by the front and said goodbye to him to see if it clicked and nothing. It just made me laugh all day that I was told what I am eating is not up to snuff but here you go enjoy. 
Other than that I thought the food was good. Loved the BLT but next time I would take out the extra piece of bread if that is an option"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"ok, I am so torn about this place. I like the place and they seem to be clean and the dogs seem happy to be ropped off but they seem to nickel and dime you to death. My husband dropped off our dog for a 5d ay visit and they asked him if the dog wanted to have extra play time. My husband says sure since they did not tell him they charge extra or that. What I picked her up they charged me for picking her up one hour late and then for the extra play time. I asked how many hours do they usually get, they said 6 hours. I said he wanted more than 6 hours play time? Ok, so here is where we have an issue. I purchased their APP and I check in every time we stop to have a drink or eat or are on a bus one in the car and out of the 5 days, I saw her one. Now if we paid for 8 hours outside a day which is more that needed, then why is she never outside? I asked this the first time she was there and she said group are kept separate from the ay care. Well is that not the reason you have several yards and why is it I never see one dog in that pool they keep going on about(in the summer) I Think we need to look into a new place because it s all about the mighty dollar and not so much about my dog"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, I will say it again. Love love love the food. I usaully always get the same thing becaue I love it so much. The waitresses so nice. Hate hate hate the manager or whoever she is. She is always staring at our food, tries to rush us and  who is that her daughrter who is working there. ? Always wispering and the two of them constantly had smaples of food while we ate. Hey if you did not have luch, go in the back and eat, dont do it in front of all the partrons who are paying. I really dont know why you dont get rid of her, she really ruins the whole meal for me and I have heard the same thing from others who dine there. Last time I overheard her tell a waitress to come and ask us if we wanted dessert . the kicker is we had just been seved our main couse so we had not even started to enjoy it. When we asked her about it as it upset my hsuband, she said oh no, I told her to ask if you wanted more water, which was odd snce we had full cups. I just feel I would have a complete great meal if I did not have to always be looking to see if she is starting at us like trying to trush us out the door. 
Just so you are aware, we would dine there more often if we did not have to see her all the time"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"OK, stay away from this place. Horrible customer service and a crappy nail job to boot. My daughter and I moved here recently so we went in for a gel manicure. They talked us into this S&S dip and said it lasted longer than gels. My daughters nails started to crack after 5 days and went back to have them redone. They only offered to do one or two tails and said they would gel on top of the rest. Hello... we paid over 130.00 with tip for something they said would last 3 weeks. Mine has already started to chip. But when my daughter refused to have 2 nail done when 6 were cracked she asked for a refund. Wait let me tell you they sat her there with acetone on her nail for an hour.   Then they led her to their. Front and screamed in her face that they don't give refunds...""look on the sign in sheet"" . Listen there are 5 nail places within 5 blocks, go anywhere but this place. Plus they have the rudeness to speak about you ..not in English as if you will not know they are speaking about you. Even a customer came out after my daughter left in tears and said she will never get her nail done there after they way they treated her....BEWARE..a place that does not respect one client ......respects none
The nail in the picture is mine which was also done 7 days ago. Chipped on the 5th day"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Oh it was very good. Loved everything I tried. Now I was a bit put off by the Maitre d . He kept staring at us the entire meal. There has to be a better option than just having him standing there all night long. Most restaurants put up a sign that says wait to be seated and you wait until someone arrives. I just though it odd having him watch me through the entire meal. It started to be a game to see if I could catch him, and I did every time. My other suggestion would be to maybe change the light bulb in the room with the bottle light. Its was just way to bright for the type of food being served.  you want a warm experience when you are spending all that money. Now the food. Very good, I had the scallops. Wished I was given a few small sauce bowels but I enjoyed the one I tried very much. The mac and cheese was great and we had the beets salad . We also had the collard greens which were very good. My daughter had the chicken and loved it. We also had the salmon and my other daughter said it was very good. So over all it was a hit. I would just put a little more effort into atmosphere and you have it made.I understand they are looking for a mod experience but the flood light during dinner could be lowered, maybe even a dimmer for dinner.
But food wise I thought it was great. I also enjoyed the wine from Abruzzo."
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, so i love VW but I also believe in good customer service. First my daughter goes in t buy a car and this salesman Patrick who behaved like a misogynist, was so rude and thew a car fax at her telling her she was not buying a car anyway. Well she decided on a car and Bill was so nice and helpful, she asked to work with him. All was good. Being unsure of going in again after the last treatment, she made an appointment to come in about this car and seal the deal with us, her parents. I forgot to mention they sent her this email about end of the month sales goals and how they are ready to make a deal. So we arrive on time and they say oh, that car was sold. Hello, does no one call you when you have an appointment to discuss this car and you sell it.? Then we sit down with another money man and they will not budge on the price. I do not know but all the throwing figures at you to try and make so just say ok is crazy. Oh so you can get a 2.25 interest  rates, well for you we can do 3.99 and just make it for 12 months more and then we do not need to come down at all, it fits your need. I just felt the whole letter was a sales scam and not being called when they car we made an appointment to speak about was sold so they can get you in the door to select a car that is one thousand dollars more and then not come down as their letter states is just bad business. The only good thing about that place is Bill."
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, Let me first say this place is a gold mine. Great view, wonderful locations but its like they have a gold mine and they are in the wrong tunnel mining for Emeralds.  I love the rooftop bar and saw this place while kayaking and have been waiting to get over there for a bite to eat. The place was almost empty and now I understand better. The bartender was nice and the beer great but they have dropped the ball on the food. OMG it was terrible and  we ever ordered another dish to see if maybe it was our selection. So after a 53.00 lunch, I am afraid this place needs some help. Fist we got the pimento dip with chips. It came out looking like a bowl of soup and the chips could not hold the liquid so it dripped allover. I even asked if it was supposed to be like that. Then we go smoked wings. Ok but it felt like it was placed in a fast smoked for like 2 minutes(the wings were a good size but not much taste). Then we got the meatballs and biscuits . The meatballs were ok but the biscuits were so dry they crumbled like breadcrumbs and we could not even eat them. 
Ok so this place should be packed on a Sunday and I wish it were my place. Look, Chili,   artichoke and cheese dip, real wings  and simple good food will bring the crowds in. The place already has a great view.  Some great soups salads and Burgers is  what you need. I want to love this place but with the area, this place should be hopping on all levels, not sitting empty"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Be very careful. I loved my Porsche in Connecticut and therefore  when I moved to NC thought I would get another. I was mislead and the place seems more than a bit shady. I was told they do not have any pre-certified  cars (as I buy preowned)  to only find out from Porsche when they called for feedback that they have plenty. I was just lied to. Then the 30 day warranty was in place and they tried to hand me a 400.00 bill. After we laughed and told them I had brought the car back twice in the 30 days for this reason they paid...but to find out something came up like 2 days later that would cost me 1K.(sound strange?) I traded my old car in because of repairs the sales person told me were no doubt to occur in the next few months, thousands worth. Now of course I question everything that was said to me and he gave me 3K less that the KBB on my car in pristine condition. The sad thing is I had a Porsche I loved and now every time I am in my new car I wish I had kept my old one. When you lose trust in a company such as Porsche where do you go from here? This will be my last Porsche and my suggestion would be to drive up to Hickory if you are looking to buy one. Even the fact they left us sitting in the showroom for the one repair that was covered by the warranty and the sales manager left to lunch and forgot to tell us the car was ready was enough good customer service for us. Most places give you a loaner car, we were left to sit and wait almost 4 hours."
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, I had to wait and think on this place a bit before I reviewed it. Loved the food and the concept but the price was a bit .....yes..its up there....high.
The courses and food was great. I enjoyed most of the courses. We shared the 12 course between the two of us. Love the start with the fresh herbs with the butter but it should have been mixed in . Maybe ask if the clients lie salted since you are mixing it fresh...just a thought.
Some of the courses were hard to split. Would say the soup was the hardest. 
The whole on NC was fun just its just a little hard on some things since we don't grow olive trees in NC. But I will say we use local when we can. Love that you carry local wines like Raffaldini.
But my whole problem is the cost . If you charged a bit less the place would be mobbed. The music did not reflect the price of the meal. I would have though instrumental would have been appropriate. We were also seated in the corner so we could not see anything and the place was empty. I would have liked to book my family for Christmas eve but they are closed. Then the thing is they are in the middle of nowhere and charge like 300.00 for dinner. 
so I liked it but with those prices will not be back for a really long time. I loved the staff and liked the concept I think they just need to lower the cost a bit to draw a crowd. Would I return, sure, if I was not paying the bill or if it was a super special occasion. I had a groupon but it was a drop in the bucket compared to the bill. A dinner for 2 is going to be over 200.00 without even thinking. But again, the food was really good"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Ok, so if I could give zero stars then I would do that. I had a wonderful experience selling  a car here, but buying seems to be a nightmare. I was looking for a certain car and spoke to someone who lead me to believe he was in the location I dialed, no such think I found out two days  later. So , I asked for a car to be brought over for me to look at for free. Then I found a better match and there was a charge to bring it over, I said fine. They said no, first you have to look at the first one and then say no and then we can bring the second one. I said I only asked to look at it yesterday....wait ..wait, ok, it was never sent so we will bring the other one, we need 250.00, fine. Then they call 3 days later to tell me the car is in(Milton) so how fast can I get down here? I cancelled all our Saturday plans and made an appointment in a few hours. Get there and Milton will not even talk to us, then has an associate take us all over the lot, no car. He goes inside and we find the car on the other side near repairs. He comes out and says the car is here but it is in no condition to be seen, hello? It was for sale at CarMax in VA. We take a test drive in a similar  one and waste 2 hours and still no Milton. No apologies, nothing. So we leave really mad as no one gave 2 S's about us wasting our time, went over to Ford and purchased a car there. Will not pay for the car to be brought there since they called me and would not let me see it. Just plain old bad customer service, plain and simple. Treat people like they are spending 20K and not 2.00. Thats the customer service rule of thumb I always use. Your loss, no sale for you"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Listen, we love our rental but the company itself stinks. They treat every renter as if they can't afford to own and their staff is terrible. When we first rented the man in charge forgot to collect some monies he never told us were due. Instead of calling and speaking to us they sent us a letter telling us to pay or else they would start eviction procedures. Really, before even calling us about a few hundred dollars? Their repair team is great.But after a year of not missing one payment and reseeding the front lawn ourselves they wanted us to renew the lease. We did not because we are currently looking for a new home. So they charged us like 200.00 a month more and the rent for the area was already high. then 5 months later they send us a check and tell us sorry to see you leave. You can either resign or leave. No back dating the lease to when it would have been originally renewed but now a year from now.  We take care of the home like we owned it and even the repair people say they have never seen one in such good shape and this is how they treat you. Originally I loved the idea of renting from a company rather than an individual but they don't appreciate good tenants and do not work with you.  Unless you have no other choice, don't rent with this company. I am sorry to say this but they treat all who rent as if they can't afford to buy and will not pay the rent instead of treating their tenants as if they are appreciated. The one area of the house I would say needs attention to would be to upgrade the carpets or do hardwood. The carpets are low grade and look years old after one year. The rest of the house is really nice. It's the company we don't like"
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"First of all two years ago we had such a nice experience and the doctor actually seemed to be one of the better  one helping her when others have failed. the next year he seems to have changed telling her her acne seemed much better when he came in the room and she told him she did not have acne and never did she was here about her skin. I was with her for both these visits. She also had a wart on her foot he had been treating. So this year she went back without me and he did not even want to look at her scalp. What kind of skin doctor is this. He as not sure what she had  anymore and now  maybe it was  a virus. Then when they go to the wart and she explained the last two treatments did not work he said he wanted to refer her for chemotherapy . First I never before heard of a 21 year old being sent for cemo for a wart and she had to call him back into the room 3 times to clear up what was told to her he was in such a rush to be gone too grab the next patient. . Listen if he has to many clients or patients and or losing his direction into plastic surgery, I am not sure, but this is not the way you treat patients. My daughter was hysterical over this treatment and left not knowing what is going on with her condition that will Likely make us have to visit a new doctor one who maybe is not so rushed. Oh, and he was paid in full for such treatment. If I had been there I woudl have made my daughter walk out without paying. The nerve . I would like to tell you to  try him but since I think he should be reported, I am just going to tell you if you do go to his place. Maybe sure you take and or record erythromycin he tells you. 
And if you think I make this stuff up, please look at my last review...how things change."
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"why why why? My husband was not thrilled with the customer service on our first visit,  but I talked him into trying the place again because I am a fan of the food.  Boy was that a mistake. We went last night and its was busy, waited a few minutes and we got a booth. We took a few minutes to order wine and then told the young lady we were also ready to order our meal as well.  So then we sat and sat until I started to wonder what was wrong. The table behind us and in front of us had sat within a few minutes of us and both had been served and were starting to complete their meal. I tried to flag down someone but one one seemed to be glancing over towards the back of the restaurant. My husband was starting to say thing like even cracker barrel is faster. So I took out my cell phone and called the restaurant to ask the older lady in the front to get our waitress. Yes, I could have gotten up and went to look for her but why should I , a customer have to do that? I said"" hello we are customers in the back of the restaurant and our waitress has not been back in 30 minutes and we have been waiting to be served for 45 minutes"" She said hello, I can barely hear you can you call back? So I hung up. about 5 or 10 minutes later she comes with our meal. I told her I was starting to worry about her. My husband said both these tables came in with us and they are all done eating .She said well they did order before you. Nothing like , I'm sorry, I forgot to put in your order, or whatever the reason for the delay was. So he was pissed and the whole meal was ruined. Such a shame because our meals tasted wonderful. I love the food here, but seriously, you have to talk to your staff, customer service is important and that is the reason we dine out, for good service."
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"ok, let me start by saying the food was very good. I enjoyed the wine even though for a 6 star restaurant it was not decanted to breath. The food was super tasty but one of the 10 best in the country? I'm not so sure I agree with that. I have eaten at some better just here in NC. The parts I did like. They texted me to ask about my arrival and the table was ready when we arrived. The down side. The staff was dressed like they had a day off and planed to run to the park or play in the yard. I am not a fan of piercings but the bull-nose ring I can do without. But she was nice. One young man looked like he was auditioning for hello Sailor with a fisherman's hat (skul cap) boots and shorts for the New Years eve crowd. I find it rude to wear hats in a restaurant and this is not a local shanty. . Ok enough of the looks and I only mentioned them becasue the prices expect more from the staff.
We asked the waitress if the potions were served family style so we could share and she said yes, you shoudl each pick two and then you can share. This is not correct, we wee each served a plate, fine but had we know we woudl not be sharing(and the portions were small) we might have selected differently. My biggest beef is they made such ta-do over serving us the main pasta course and then we began to eat and offers each other a taste of ours. My daughters was wonderful and I finished me and then thought, wait, I thought mine was supposed to have olives. Again, the portions were small so it was only a few minutes from sharing to finished. I called over the waitress who was busy and the Gordon's Fisherman came to offer assistance. I asked what dish my daughter was eating and he confirmed she was just about finished with my meal. Now, he seemed to think it was no big deal and asked if he could do anything but I don't like the way he made it seem like it happens all the time. When i pay 18.00 for a appetizer plate of pasta, I expect the right plate. At least seem sorry. I again told the waitress when she came  over and she seemed to act the same way. I just expect more from a restaurant  with such high reviews. I might suggest going over to Fresh Chef and hiring their staff who are super friendly and go out of their way to serve. Maybe it was us, but I did not feel it was worth the almsot 300.00 experience. Was it good, yes, but I would have preferred to eat what I had ordered and not have to watch my daughter enjoy it. They may have announced what it was when it was served but it was all in a flurry and who would think they would give the wrong plate to the wrong person. Now we have reservations the weekend before Valentines day and not really sure it worth all the hype. So sad, since I was so excited to have gotten a reservation."
_5keMAmic7zzrnM5mVefBw,"Usually I will not review a place and give myself a few days to think upon it, but with the  risk of other beloved pets I think I should speak right away. I had planned on taking my daughter 4 hours away for the weekend. I had arranged all the directions and proper Vaccines as requested a few months ago, as we just moved down from CT but had not used Waggin Tails as of yet. We have 3 dogs, one  who has a bad leg due to a plate being removed was left at vet to make sure she did not over do it. The other two dogs are Bernese Mountain Dogs who do not tolerate the heat very well. 
When making the reservations I asked point blankly if they had an air conditioned room for the dogs who did not wish to be outside and I was told 'yes'. I actually  asked more than 4 times and was reassured that they monitor the dogs, and if they need to be inside then they are placed in an indoor playroom.  I said 'ok' because our Tucker only goes out to poop in this heat, that is all. I guess I must have mistaken Linda's cool demeanor on the first evaluation as efficiency. When I dropped off the dogs they removed their quick release collars (which I was instructed to purchase)  and switched them to some green collars Waggin tails uses. This was fine if tits policy, but found it odd as I had just spend 20.00 to buy my Haley a new collar as hers was a Martingale. I went over the food and meds as Tucker was just getting over a sore foot that was almost completely healed (he only had one day left on meds and the vet said he should be fine) . When they first took the dog I did notice the man who was taking them through the door start to knee poor Tucker to stop him from coming back out. OK, I let this go as I do know how difficult it is to handle a dog of his size.
I purchased the video package from their website so I could watch the playground as we could not rent the luxury kennel for the dogs with the TV in it. 
I was only gone from Friday afternoon until Sunday at about 4PM. So this is what I get when I arrive... Linda the Nasty says to me that I bought my dog in with a green chest (from mold), common among dogs that drool a lot. They were going to call me but since I was only going to be gone for two days, decided not to. Then they bring him out and he looks horrible. All the white under his chin was now green and wet and matted... like they put a collar on him to tight and left him sitting out in the sun for hours. Again, Linda insured this was common among drooling dogs. I've had Tucker for 6 years & never managed to turn him GREEN. His eye has conjunctivitis from either poor treatment or stress. His foot that was almost healed was twice the size and he had to be placed back on meds. Please let me note that the vet has never seen that color green on a Bernese Mountain Dog and is not familiar with this ""common green plague"". The vet noticed red marks, and shaved his neck to find hot spots from the abuse. Now Linda assured me that if he was hot, he was taken in. 
I paid over 200.00 for a 2 days visit so my dog could be cared for better than I do myself.  Its cost me over 150.00 today alone at the vets and once he is recovered I have to have him bathed remove whats left of the green dye that came from there substandard collar. 
The worst of it were the LIES that came when I picked him up. Linda clearly tried to make it seem as if was a new dog owner and maybe did not know anything about them. When I asked why I didn't see any of the dogs on the web cam I was told ""oh, that is not by us even though it on our website... but though a third party. If you were sitting at a real computer if would be free.""  I asked as soon as I saw him all wet and under stress if he had been kept in the AC; they they told me they had an air conditioned room  but they are not allowed him in there alone... so... they left him out in the 98 degrees weather and watched. If they got too hot they are taken in and placed in their kennel. The reason I left him there and not the vets was so he could have socialize with the other dogs in the AC. I asked over 5 times about the AC!!  The most upsetting thing is that if I had been gone a week, I am sure I wouldn't have had a dog to come home to. Now I have an additional two weeks of meds and a dog with hot spot looking as if he has been brutalized. This is what I pay over $200.00 for? The least they could do is admit they do not know how to take care of high maintenance dogs  refund our money. 
We can use it for all the vet bills Wagging Tail so kindly left us with. I will be sure to make sure everyone I'm able to reach knows not to use this place again. It is one thing to own a business and perform poorly,  but to outright lie to a client and assume they are ignorant is inexcusable.  If you let them care for your pet, you are gambling with their health... or life."
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"I have to start out by saying, if it wasn't for Yelp, I definitely wouldn't have eaten at this divey but tasty spot! It was a Sunday night, I didn't feel like cooking, and we were wanting some comfort food - so what better than authentic Chinese food?! A lot of Chinese restaurants are closed on Sundays but to our luck, King Wong was open and not too far down the road! Everyone else had the same idea because their carry out orders were flying out the door! 

We decided to dine in and you guys, it is absolutely NOTHING fancy but sometimes the most unassuming places are the best! 

My husband and I got the family meal for two for $11.95 per person and it was basically enough food for 4! It came with: 

Choice of Soup (LARGE BOWL, about 6 cups worth) - We got Egg Flower
2 eggrolls and 2 crab wontons
1 large order of sweet and sour chicken (not my fav, the breading was a little thick for my liking)
1 large order of beef with broccoli (INCREDIBLE flavor)
1 large order of BBQ fried rice (MY FAVORITE!)

Um, can you say feast?!  The sweet guy working encouraged us to move to a larger table because we would have so many dishes. ha! It is safe to say that we went home with pounds of leftovers. 

The service was so friendly. They were crazy busy with to-go/delivery orders and they felt bad about making us wait a tad so they brought us extra egg rolls (that we definitely didn't need after all of that tasty food!). 

Anyways, our Sunday comfort food fix was definitely met and we will absolutely be back. You can't beat the family feast price. If you're feeling lazy, they do deliver! See you again soon, King Wong!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"My fiance had a gift card to Outback, so we decided to use it for a date night! I don't usually gravitate towards chains, but we gave this a shot! It just so happened that we went on ""No Worries Wednesday"" AND arrived before 7 PM, just in time for Happy Hour! On No Worries Wednesdays, they have a variety of 3-course menu items for $12.99, $16.99, and $19.99. I ordered the house salad (I LOVE their ranch!), a 6oz Outback Sirloin w/ a loaded baked potato and a mason jar of strawberry shortcake for dessert! ALL of this food was only $12.99!! The steak was super juicy, tender, and spiced to perfection. My fiance got their firecracker salmon and all of the same sides that I got, for $16.99. It was topped with mango salsa that he said was delicious! 

On top of the great food, I HAVE to comment on our service. Katie was one of the best servers that I have had in months. She described everything perfectly, was super passionate about her job, and even brought us extra ranch just because we said that we loved their ranch (we didn't even ask for it!). She timed our food perfectly and made the experience a great one. In addition, the manager stopped by our table to ensure that everything was going well. It was such a nice touch! I overheard other servers and they seemed just as great! Major props to the managing team here for training their employees to be world class! 

All in all, I would definitely come back. It was a super easy date night and the food was delicious, with an unbeatable price. The restaurant was also packed on a Wednesday night so you know that they are doing something right! Thank you Outback!!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"We've been on a chore rampage lately while getting our first baby's nursery all setup! When we bought our house, the rooms didn't have window coverings or ceiling fans in the back rooms after the remodel so we came to home depot last weekend on the hunt for both.

We found the PERFECT ceiling fan that was just the right size for under $100. It is SO classy looking. We had looked at fans last summer but I didn't find any that I loved (i'm so picky) so when we found this one, I was thrilled. We ended up getting 2 of them, one for our master as well. 

As for the blinds - we had no idea how to go about this. But thanks to Don, we were totally taken care of in the blind department! He explained all of our options regarding quality, material, corded vs. not corded, custom vs. those that could be cut right there, color, etc. We happened to be IN LUCK because the high quality custom blinds happened to be on sale which made them the same price as the lower quality blinds. YAY!! Baby gets NICE blinds for his ""crib"". Get it? haha. Don was so helpful in explaining the features that we would need and those that we could do without. We ordered them right then and there and they are being shipped to our house at no extra charge. Yes, please! 

This Home Depot has never failed us - from gardening stuff to random tools, they've got it all and are ready and willing to help. THE BEST PART, you can bring your pooch along for the errand. We brought our sheepie with us this past Saturday (since in the summertime he stays in the house bored most of the time) and he got so much attention + had a BLAST! We'll be back soon (maybe even today)."
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"OH MY GOODNESS! I finally made it in to Glai Baan and am SO happy that I did. First, the ambiance is so cozy, hip, and romantic. It does get busy on weekends so I recommend calling ahead if you have a large party! It makes the perfect date night spot or good for small groups of 4-6. The cocktails are truly unique, whipped up by a FABULOUS and well-known Valley mixologist (Hi Maxwell!). He made me the yummiest Thai Tea Mocktail that came in the cutest cup, with an adorable straw, and umbrella. Yes, please. I loved it. For all the mommas out there, have him make this for you! 

For appetizers, our group of 5 people shared 3 orders (yes, THREE, they're that good) of their dumplings, one order of their fried rice with chicken, papaya salad, and their wings. Oh my goodness, everything was so flavorful but the dumplings are definitely some of the best that i've ever had. 

For my entree, I ordered the Kao Soi. Think Thai Curry in a soup version with rice noodles, chicken, cilantro, herbs, etc. OH MY GOSH, obsessed. It was a HUGE portion as well. You better believe i'll be coming here on the regular during the wintertime to get a bowl of this comforting goodness. It is literally soup for the soul.

If you love Thai food, this will be your new favorite place in town. It really doesn't compare to any other Thai food that i've had in the Valley, or ever. Possibly because their menu consists of ""street"" Thai dishes but honestly, it is dreamy. You can thank me later. ;) We'll be back again soon, for sure!

P.S. Sorry for the lack of foodie photos! It was a tad dark and I just didn't feel that my photos did the food justice so I kept it a surprise! ;)"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"Oh my goodness, YC's has been a favorite of mine since I was a little girl. It used to be tradition for my dad and I to come after swim meets because i'd LOAD up on food after swimming my little booty off! 

The prices have changed throughout the years but I believe now you can get a small bowl for around $12. This sounds high but my goodness, you can pack that bowl SKY HIGH so it actually ends up being enough food to fill a large bowl. You go through the line starting with meats (I'm a chicken and beef gal + don't forget to press the meat down with a piece of their thin paper so that it doesn't take up your whole bowl!), and then load up on tons of veggies, noodles, and ALL THE SAUCES. My favorite sauces are their YC's own, garlic, a little bit of peanut oil, chili oil, cooking wine, and whatever else sounds good to me that day. They have tiny bowls that you can put your sauce mixture in so that it doesn't make a mess. Because trust me, your bowl will be packed to the max and if you put the sauces over the pile, they'll run right off. Then, head over to the Mongolian grill masters where they'll grill up your bowl of goodness right in front of you! 

Next, you can grab their wontons (I love dipping them in sweet and sour sauce), top your bowl with peanuts, fresh cilantro, and pineapple if you like it, and grab a bowl of rice and soup. Can you say LOADS of food?! They do charge a little extra for to-go bags but I will tell you that from my experience, it just isn't as good the next day. Some people even get it to-go from the start and just eat half there and take the rest home. Everyone has their own method to their madness. I'll be back soon, YC's!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"Ohhhhh man, I don't even know where to start with this delicious experience! My best friend and her family make it a tradition to come to Martorano's every time they are in Vegas and this time, I was the lucky guest that got to learn WHY they love this place so much! I'm not sure why they only have 3.5 stars because I thought it was absolutely incredible from beginning to end and left the most full that i've ever been. HIGHLIGHT: The menus LIGHT UP so that you can see what you're reading! I've never seen this before and it is such a cool concept! :) 

We ordered a delicious bottle of Malbec to start, and enjoyed it along with their family-style apps {that they dish up for you!} and soft and airy bread with parm and dipping oils. For the appetizers, we ordered their famous Meatball & Salad {a MUST! I could probably eat this for my meal}, the Eggplant Stacked made with house made mozzarella {ANOTHER MUST}, and the calamari. We were honestly full after these apps but then the REAL meal came! I ordered the Chicken Sicilian and it was so delicious. Chicken tenders, mushrooms, capers, and hot cherry peppers. Warning, it does have a kick but I love that! The entrees do not come with a side but I ordered a side of spaghetti so that I could taste their famous marinara sauce. The entrees are HUGE and if you order apps, I highly recommend splitting them. I also tried my friend's Veal Piccata and that was delish too! 

All in all, a VERY great experience. Pro Tips: Order an app or two, share entrees and a few sides. This place is pricey and you don't want to be left with a ton of extra food like we were because when you're on vacation, leftovers go to waste! :)"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"My husband and I came here for date night last week and had an INCREDIBLE meal! We live in the neighborhood so were waiting for the newness to wear off a tad {due to long wait times} before giving it a try and i'm so happy that we finally made it in. They also take reservations which is a major plus - I highly recommend doing so, even for a party of 2! They were packed on a Wednesday evening.

To start, we ordered the Heirloom Tomato and Quinoa salad and it was one of my top 5 fav salads ever. I LOVED that it had two dressings - a feta yogurt dressing and a champagne vinaigrette. They went so well together! The salad had sweet heirloom tomatoes, quinoa, olives, pine nuts, and more goodies that were just so tasty. I would get this for a meal with chicken and be the happiest camper. 

For dinner, we split the heirloom tomato {apparently we have a thing for heirloom tomatoes} + artichoke pizza and added fennel sausage to it. It was also extremely delicious. I loved the chewy crust! We also split the half bird with cauliflower mash and the umami sauce, horseradish sauce, and jalapeno pesto. Oh man, 3 sauces may have been overkill but I absolutely loved every one of them. The horseradish sauce is SO good on the cauliflower mash. 

Of course we couldn't leave without dessert! We ordered the Elvis and practically licked the mason jar. I wasn't super fond of the bacon cookies though. That is just a personal preference. 

We will definitely be back. My only complaint is that prices are a bit high. I feel like the pizzas could be reduced by a few bucks to compete with surrounding pizzerias but that is just my two cents! Yet again, Sam Fox knocks it out of the park!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"So I have been to a ton of Diamondbacks games here and have always had a great time, however, coming for a concert was an entirely different experience! We arrived right at 5 PM (when the concert was set to start) and stumbled into a HUGE mass of people; literally thousands of people. We ended up waiting in this mass (not even a line because there were so many people) for one hour and along with the thousands of people in the crowd, missed the first performer and part of the second one. I think that Chase Field is a great venue for concerts (wide open and airy), however, the entry process was a nightmare. People were shoving, fighting, yelling, everything that you can imagine would happen when thousands of people are pressed up against each other for an hour. Thank goodness it wasn't very hot on Saturday because that would have made things even worse!

our seats were in the 200s, right on the edge. It was a fab spot because we could see everything and didn't have to stand the entire 5 hours! However, when we went to get food or a drink, we had to wait in MORE lines! One time, we waited for 40 minutes to get a beer and food. Then, when we got to the front of the line, the service was horrendous. The cashier was incredibly rude and actually told us that 'pouring beer was not her forte'. Our beers were half foam and she seemed frustrated with us and the fact that she had to pour the beer. She also asked us our order about 3 times with an annoyed tone in her voice. 

All of that said, it seems that Chase has baseball games down pat, but other events here may need a little more attention! I don't know if I will come back to a concert here, it was more stress that it was worth!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"Okay, so I have to admit, I wasn't the biggest fan of Teharu. Being a new-ish sushi eater {and not super daring} I found the quality, fishiness, and crazy use of mayo and crunchy toppings to not be appealing. 

However, i'm a total believer that you get what you pay for hence the 3 stars. When you order a 4-piece sushi roll that is under $1.50, the quality should be questioned. I saw so many rolls go around and around their tracks that weren't getting eaten, therefore, just sitting out in the open {with lids for germ protection} and not refrigerated. With the mayo, fish, etc. on the rolls this made me so nervous! 

How it works: 
They have a variety of different sushi, rolls, edamame, cucumber salad, desserts, drinks, pot stickers, etc. rotating around a huge bar-type setup. Each item is on a colored plate and the color associates it with the price. The prices were $1, $1.50, and $2 depending on which plates you grab. Then, at the end the waitresses add up your plates to determine your bill. While service is extremely quick because you simply just grab what you want, I believe that as a result, the freshness goes out the window. Out of the few rolls that I tried, they were all pretty fishy and warm. My pet peeve is warm sushi! It has gotta be COLD! I ended up sticking with the cucumber salad, pot stickers, and edamame to play it safe. 

The scariest part for me was that some of the items literally looked like plastic. The crab was 100% artificial and looked that way. Yikes, it just freaked me out. 

That said, I won't be back but if you aren't super picky about the quality of your seafood/sushi and want a quick, cheap sushi fix, I can see how Teharu could be a great place to go."
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"As an expecting, first time momma, i've spent quite a bit of time here over the past few months! I can honestly say, each visit to the store, i've had a completely different experience. 

My weekday experiences have been WAY better than weekends because the human traffic flow is way less and you can get help pretty quickly. 

The weekends, however, are an entirely different story. I've found that most guests who come here end up needing quality attention from an employee because they're most likely making big furniture purchases and want to make sure that they're doing it right. Totally understandable! That said, AVOID this store on weekends. I ended up waiting over an hour to speak with someone a few weeks back and was pretty frustrated. I think they may just need a few more staff members on weekends? Everyone is always friendly, however, over the weekend they seem rushed and stressed. 

Last week, we went to pick up a dresser and the process was pretty smooth, however, they were short handed and didn't have someone to help in stock so the lady was hesitant about helping us load it (almost asking if we could come another time but that wasn't possible for us since we don't live nearby and happened to have a large vehicle this day). She asked if I had someone with me who could help. Luckily my husband was with me so we had his muscles! However, I feel like they should have a stock helper at all times? Their furniture is HEAVY and pregnant mommas most likely won't be able to assist with loading.

I know i'll be back for more things over the next few months but i'll definitely be going on weekdays. Since we have all of the furniture now, I don't think we'll be needing any help with heavy lifting."
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"I FINALLY made it in to Forno 301!! I came here with a group of 9 last night and to our surprise, we were seated in their awesome private room. It was the perfect space for a group of 8-12. The service was VERY prompt, food came out quickly (almost too quickly!) and we really enjoyed our experience. 

But of course, the food. I've heard from so many people that this is some of the most authentic Italian food that you'll find in the Valley. Well, they were right! We started with their cauliflower, meatballs, and bruschetta appetizers. All were amazing. The main event was definitely the meatballs! The crunchy bread dipped in the unique red sauce was so dang good.

I ordered the cucumber and tomato salad and it was the perfect simple salad with a balsamic vinaigrette, mixed greens, feta cheese, caramelized onions, and olives. If you're ordering for a dinner salad before your meal, you can definitely split it. It is pretty large! For my entree, I ordered their pizza that came with artichokes, olives, mushrooms and prosciutto but got it without the prosciutto. It was DIVINE! Definitely just like Italy. The crust was chewy, yet charred to perfection. My ONLY complaint was that the toppings were a little too heavy for the pizza and they slid off on a few pieces but hey, I just piled them back on and all was good in the world. 

Many of my friends ordered the homemade pastas and I think i'll have to give those a whirl next time. They looked amazing.

One thing to note when coming here with a group - they do not split checks and will not give individual checks. SO, be prepared for one person to foot the bill and the rest pay that person back with cash or Venmo! I will absolutely be back to this tasty, authentic Italian gem."
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"We came in here around 8:45 PM on a Wednesday night because we were in the area and starving! All that we were looking for was food, but to our surprise, Handlebar-J was hopping! Apparently they had a live band, hence the $5 cover per person {I have not paid a cover charge in YEARS!!!}. We were are little taken back by the cover charge because we were literally there to eat dinner, not two-step the night away to the live band. But, we were starving and didn't want fast food, so we paid it. 

When we arrived, we told them that two of us were eating dinner and the other two were just going to have drinks. They almost didn't even seat us in the {pretty empty} dining room because all four of us weren't eating? Huh? It was so odd! They did end up seating us there and we ordered right away. 

My review would probably be two stars because of the hassle at the beginning but our server was very attentive and didn't miss a beat! We ordered a cheese crisp to split and I ordered a caesar salad with chicken for my entree. The cheese crisp had a little too much cheese on it {if that is possible} but it was decent. The salad was good, but not worth $10.50 {more than my friend's sliders and fries!!!}. I found it interesting that their salads were more expensive than much heartier dishes on their menu. Oh well! All in all, the food was just ok. For 4 beers, 2 entrees, and 2 appetizers, we spent a total of $92 including tip and cover charge. Yikes! 

All in all, I probably won't come back BUT if you are into country music and dancing, this would 100% be your place. Everyone on the dance floor looked like they were having a blast.

P.S. I didn't post pics because it was super dark inside which equals bad foodie photos. {I'm a perfectionist!}"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"FUCHSIA SAVED MY WEEKEND! 

It was a Friday afternoon and I had a lunch meeting up on High Street. I had been battling a screaming tension headache most of the week and desperately needed a massage. I knew about the Fuchsia location up on High Street so before my meeting, I popped in to see if they had a 30 minute opening to help fix my headache. I knew it was a long shot since I was so last minute but miraculously, THEY COULD GET ME IN! The best part, the therapist that was available specialized in tension headaches and migraines. Oh my gosh, my week was MADE!  

I feel awful because I totally forget my therapist's name but you better believe i'll be scheduling with her again because she was a DREAM. One thing that I love about Fuchsia is that their massages come standard with your choice of essential oil to use during your massage. They offer peppermint which I know is good for headaches. So, I chose that! They also let you choose what kind of music you'd like to listen to. I had a 30 minute express massage and wish it would have been 2 hours. She hit every spot and I can honestly say, she is the first therapist who completely made the headache go away by the time I walked out. They also offered a tingling scalp massage for an additional $5 on special - um, yes please!! 

I walked in feeling so disgruntled because my head had been throbbing most of the week and walked out feeling like a million bucks, tingling scalp and all. She even gave me some techniques to help with future headaches which I was so grateful for! I live pretty far from this location but a visit to see this therapist is worth the drive. I'll be back! :) Thank you for making my weekend MUCH more manageable! 

P.S. I will update when I get the name of my awesome therapist!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"Uhg, I never thought i'd relate a medical lab to the DMV (one of my top 5 least favorite places on earth) but unfortunately, my experience felt just like that. You can walk in with no appointment, enter your information into their iPads at the front, and then sit, and wait, and wait, until you're called. Unless you get lucky and happen to walk in when no one else is there. But, like the DMV, this has never been my experience. 

I popped in at 9:30a on a Wednesday thinking that I would avoid the early morning or lunchtime rushes but nope! I counted 25 people in the waiting room. *Sigh* I sat in the corner because it was stuffy and I honestly felt like I would get sick (and being pregnant, I do not want this) from all of the people sitting there. You never know what germs could be circling around a medical waiting room with 25 people. EEEK!  I was sitting there waiting to be called, and after 45 minutes decided to go up and check in with the front to see how much longer it would be. They said that they had already called my name and no one came. Wait, WHAT?! I've been listening attentively this entire time, minus answering a few emails on my phone, but I definitely still would have heard my name called. I'm guessing it was mumbled and didn't sound right? Who knows. Thinking back, I did hear something that KIND OF sounded like my name but another lady went up as soon as that name was called so I assumed it was her. 

Another 10 minutes go by and they call me back. The actual blood draw experience was quick and easy and the lady was very nice! But sheesh, what an ordeal just to get your blood drawn!! 

I'm not sure if every SQ lab is like this, but I think i'll try a different location next time. Hopefully it will be less busy and a more pleasant waiting room experience."
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"How have I not been here yet?! I have seen Modern Market there for years but I guess had just *very wrongly* assumed that it was more of a market with snack type foods than incredible meal options and catering!

I met a friend here on a Friday at lunchtime and it was pretty busy! Only complaint was that parking was CRAZY but that isn't MM's fault. I love their order-at-the-counter concept and they have so many healthy, but hearty options. Their menu offers delicious bowls, salads, flatbreads, protein/veggie combos, and more. There is literally something for everyone here. Once you order, they give you a number and bring it to your table when it is ready.

I ordered their steak salad for lunch and it was honestly the dreamiest. I've been craving it since I left! It has mixed greens, super tender (and a good amount!) of steak, roasted potatoes, caramelized onions, I swapped the blue cheese for feta, roasted tomatoes, and a VERY yummy balsamic dressing. Oh man, all of those flavors together were literally heaven in a bowl. AND THEN, my pregnant brain did not have self control and ordered a side of their Mac & Cheese. IT WAS SO CREAMY! Yum! Both of these items are complete winners. 

I was so impressed with their drink options. They have natural sodas at the fountain, a variety of teas, and very yummy fresh lemonades! They had carrot lemonade and cucumber mint lemonade. The carrot sounded a little weird to me when I saw it but oh my gosh, it was the BEST! It was basically like getting a fresh juice to go along with your meal. 

I cannot wait to go back to Modern Market and I LOVE that their patio is dog friendly. In fact, i'll be back next week with my sheepie in tow! Thanks for a great experience MM, I don't know what I was waiting for. It is also worth saying that their team working the counter was so friendly."
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"Eeeeeek, you guys. I AM SO SAD to do this. My husband and I wanted to take our pooch to lunch on a Sunday afternoon and Arcadia Tavern is walkable from our house + allows dogs on their patio. Yes, please! We need a break from OHSO every once in a while! 

We hadn't eaten here in a few months and SO MANY THINGS have changed! They basically cut their menu in half or even a quarter and unfortunately removed all of the dishes that we LOVED! I'll miss the Caprese Salad with grilled artichokes so much! I honestly came here for that salad. But oh well, I can branch out so I ordered their Tavern Salad with chicken (tossed in buffalo sauce) and ranch. Well friends, the entire salad was drenched (and I mean DRENCHED) in buffalo sauce and they put ranch on the side. Like what chef does this??! I asked for the chicken only to be buffalo, not the entire salad, let alone dripping in it. I could barely eat it and for a $16 salad, this totally bummed me out. Also, I don't think the ranch is homemade anymore. WAHHHH! It was not good.

Now you're probably wondering why I didn't send the salad back? Well, we were starving when we got there and the service was SO SLOW (and we were one of 3 tables on the patio). My husband got his beer AFTER our food came and we ordered it way before. So by the time it came, I was pretty darn hangry and ate it anyway. We had also asked the hostess to turn off the heater and turn on the TV by us but that never happened. 

All in all, it was just such a bummer experience and I can honestly say we won't be back. Prices are SO high, food quality went way down, and service was slow despite the restaurant being wide open. For two of us to eat lunch (2 entrees, 1 Coors Light, and 1 iced tea) our bill was $50. This totally makes me sad since we live blocks away and it is a convenient spot to bring our pup. Oh well!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"I am SO grateful for Classy Closets! We live in the Arcadia area where the closets and bathrooms are SMALL! The rest of our house had been updated when we bought it but the closet sizes remained the same. Yikes! Our master closet is a standard reach in, with one bar across the center and a shelf above the bar with a TON of space above the top shelf. That said, I was taking over our entire master closet and the guest room closet and my husband is in the office closet. Crazy, I know! We had loads of wasted space in the master closet. 

We have a baby on the way so it was time to move my stuff out of the guest room and Classy Closets came to the rescue! The best part, I requested a quote on Yelp and heard back within minutes!! 

Charity was the designer - She visited our house, I showed her some inspiration from Pinterest, she took down some measurements, and then whipped up a drawing/plan of exactly what I was looking for within a few days! Definitely pay attention to all dimensions as I noticed the original and ""standard"" shelves were only 12 feet deep but I wanted 18"" to allow for as much extra room as possible! The deeper shelves allowed for more shoes, which was totally necessary! It did cost extra because it required special cutting/ordering but 100% worth the extra money. It was that or not having enough room for all of my shoes. 

The actual install was SO smooth. The guys showed up right on time and had it done within 2 hours! I was shocked. They were so friendly as well. 

My closet looks AMAZING, is great quality, and I was able to combine 2 closets into 1 (and still have some room!). I'm a VERY happy momma! Unfortunately my husband is still in the office but we're okay with that for now - until baby #2, then i'll have to get real creative! ;) Maybe built-ins? Thank you for making my closet dreams come true, Classy Closets!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"I FINALLY made it in to Dick's Hideaway! I have been to their sister restaurant, Richardson's (and love it) so have been meaning to make it in to Dick's forever! 

As you drive up, it is tough to find because they don't have a sign, SO you enter at the door to the right of Luci's main entrance. They don't take reservations and seats are limited so weekends may have a wait but on a Tuesday night, we were a-ok! We sat at their community table and had a lovely experience. The ambiance is dark and cozy. The room that we were in was lined with dusty wine bottles, making it feel so 'old world'. It can also be a bit loud so if you're looking for a quiet place to dine, this may not be your spot. It probably isn't the best for large parties unless you reserve one of their rooms ahead of time. I'd say keep it to 2-4 people, MAYBE 6 if you sit at their community table.

For food, we started with their roasted garlic appetizer and it was SO MUCH MORE than I expected! It had giant roasted garlic cloves, with peppers, cheese, and a yummy sauce to put over the top of crostinis. It was a DREAM and a must order if you're in need of an app. Heck, it could probably even be a meal.

For my entree, I got their seafood linguine and it came with a side salad. Their side salad is the same as Richardson's and it is my FAV! It comes on an ice cold plate with lettuce, thick shredded cheddar, green onions, diced peppers, and the tastiest jalapeño ranch dressing. I love an ice cold salad! The pasta was also amazing - it had 2 large shrimps, 2 jumbo scallops, linguine, tomatoes, spinach, and parm in a thin white wine + butter sauce. It was pretty rich and after the amazing app + salad, I definitely brought some home! Entree price points are on average $20+. 

My only complaint was that our service wasn't the most attentive but we still had a great time. I'll be back!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"Have I mentioned that I love Hobby Lobby? Well, I do, the love is TRUE!

I typically go to the Cactus location but when near Indian Bend, you better believe i'm stopping in here! I've also been known to go to both locations in one day. (Don't tell my husband!)

Pro Tip: Before stepping foot in a Hobby Lobby, download their app! Not only is there a 40% off of one full price item coupon but it will also tell you which items are 50% off for the week. You guys, they literally have half of the store 50% off each week and it rotates every other. It is INSANE. 

So when we bought our house and I needed decor, I pretty much bought 90% of 'cute' things from here. They have GREAT art, candles, knick knacks, bowls, pillows, frames, lamps, mirrors, baskets, vases, etc. They even have some furniture. I made sure to check their app before I went so that the items I was looking for were 50% off each time. I literally got a GORGEOUS lamp and rustic wood mirror for 50% off. And when they're having their annual clearance, it is even better! Their decor always seems to be on trend as well, therefore, making me want to redecorate my home every time I step in! 

Another time Hobby Lobby was my best friend was when we were getting married and I was collecting decor for the wedding. We were doing a candy bar and I bought all of the glass dishes to put the candy in there for 50% off, I bought cute signs to scatter around the wedding, frames that matched our 'black and white stripe' theme, candles, and other fun things. 

And the NEXT time I know that Hobby Lobby and I will be best friends is when i'm decorating a baby's room! (No, there is no bun in the oven, i'm just saying)! I've been eyeing their cute children's decor before I even had a boyfriend. ;) haha! 

I'll see you soon, Hobby Lobby! Thank you for making all of my home decor and creative dreams come true."
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"You guys - I am SO SO sad to do this! If you know me, you know that I am not a fan of writing negative reviews. However, my experience at Blue Nail Bar unfortunately warrants one. I came in on a Sunday afternoon and was blown away at how gorgeous it is inside! The modern ambiance is great and the pedicure chairs/bowls were beautiful! It has been in the neighborhood for a few months now but I finally got the courage to leave my normal spot to give it a shot. 

When I walked in, I was greeted with a smile and everyone was so friendly! I was so excited because I saw that they had SNS gel as an option which is what I usually get at another nail salon that is too far from home. My first red flag should have been when I saw the amount of SNS color options they had available - not many. AKA they most likely don't do SNS manicures that often. The lady doing my nails was SO sweet so like I said, i'm not a fan of writing reviews like this one. 

However, throughout the course of the manicure, I was cut on almost all of my fingers, one so bad that we had to apply pressure to it and it continued to bleed when I left, and the SNS gel was all over my fingers (pictures explain it all). This was not easy to get off at all and required a trip to Target to buy acetone and a lot of scrubbing! 

That said, the owner was really nice and gave me 50% off of my total and offered to re-do them but i'm having surgery this week and really didn't have the time. Today, I am still in pain from the cuts, one nail is an entirely different color than the rest, and i'm just pretty bummed. However, their regular mani/pedi/gel services could be fab so this review is literally just speaking for the SNS mani. They may just need a little more practice under their belt! All in all, there are SO many nail salons in the Valley and I really do like my normal spot so I won't be back here."
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"I don't even know where to begin with this review! Our Steak 44 experience was literally off of the charts. Pricey, but worth it. I made my reservation online and mentioned that we were celebrating my fiance's new job in the notes. We had barely even gotten through the door before they said CONGRATS and welcomed us with big smiles! He was so happy! 

We got there a little early so that we could partake in their Happy Hour drinks + eats in the bar before dinner. Their martinis are delicious and they give you the shaker so it really ends up being almost 2 drinks! We had their giant shrimp {pricey but oh so good!} and their king crab and avocado stack - holy YUM! 

For dinner, the service was exceptional. EVERYONE in the restaurant knew our names. I literally got up to go to the restroom and slightly bumped into one of the servers {not our server} and he kindly said ""oh, i'm sorry Hailey!"". I thought to myself, how does HE know my name?! Now that is world-class, folks! Ok, ok, enough about the service -THE FOOD! We ordered an inexpensive bottle of wine to start {~$35} and then their beet salad and chopped salad; oh my goodness, the beet salad was divine. They definitely go heavy on the beets, which we love!! For dinner we split the scallops and a NY strip steak - both literally melted in our mouths. I highly recommend doing this! For sides, we had their truffle double baked potato and the shishito peppers. The potato was so rich and creamy that we each only had 1/4 of it, leaving 1/2 to take home! The peppers were incredible, with the perfect amount of kick. 

THEN, since we were celebrating Ben's new job, they brought out not 1, but 2 heavenly desserts! We came home with multiple to-go bags but they made for another great dinner at home! Thank you so much for the world-class experience, Steak 44! You are our new go-to celebration spot! Whether you are looking to impress clients, celebrate something special, or just spoil yourself - Steak 44 is a must."
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"We came here for an early NYE date night since my husband was scheduled to work on NYE and we had a great meal. We were able to sit on the patio where they had loads of heaters and it was actually the perfect temperature, even in December! There was a table facing the fireplace that looked so romantic and cozy. When we asked to sit there, they told us that it was reserved but then no one came the entire time that we were there! :( So we were a little bummed that we had to sit in the corner of the patio when that was open, but hey, can't win them all I suppose!

For food, we started with their scallop appetizer and it was SO TASTY! My only complaint was that you get 2 scallops for $16. Whew, a little pricy but the flavors were extraordinary. I think even if they had 3, that would have been a good amount. 2 just seemed a little weird on the plate. They also brought DELICIOUS bread and pesto. You could tell the pesto was made fresh there on site. We also ordered a bottle of  Cabernet and it was the perfect compliment to our meal. 

Next, my husband and I split the heirloom beet salad and it was one of the best beet salads that i've ever had. The feta dressing was phenomenal! The arugula was nice and peppery - just the way I like it.

For my entree, I ordered their Flat Iron Steak and it was SO tender! It seriously rivaled a filet and was a great portion size. It is served with their signature steak sauce that I absolutely loved as well. For sides, we split the fries with truffle aioli and Haricot Vert Nicoise (green beans served cold with olives, feta, and a lemony/vinaigrette dressing). THEY WERE AMAZING! 

For dessert we split their gelato (served on an ice block!) and cookies and the lavender gelato was dreamyyyyy! The cookies didn't knock my socks off but the gelato was well worth it. 

All in all, the culinary talent here is great! For the price range, I have had better meals at other Valley establishments but we definitely didn't leave hungry and our tastebuds were happy! :)"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"I don't even have enough words to describe how magical our wedding day was at The Clayton on the Park. From start to finish, Claire was the absolute sweetest and made sure that every question was answered, every request was granted {that she had control over}, and ensured that our day was everything that we had dreamed of and more...which it was!

We are still hearing feedback on how gorgeous our venue was, how it was in the perfect location that made it convenient for everyone, how it was the BEST WEDDING FOOD EVER {so important to my foodie soul}, and everyone had the most amazing time + stayed until the end.

It happened to be raining on our special day {I never thought this would happen in February in AZ but it DID!} and we're so happy that it did. {I bet you never thought you'd hear a bride say that now, huh?!}. Our original plan was to get married in the Civic Center Park and have the reception at The Clayton. However, when I saw heavy rain + wind in the forecast, I wasn't even nervous because I knew the upstairs ceremony space at The Clayton was just as perfect as the park...and guess what, it turned out even better than the park would have been because our ceremony was SO intimate, you could see the rain drops through their gorgeous glass windows {THAT OPEN!}, and it made for the most romantic setting. 

My favorite thing about The Clayton is it's modern, simplistic vibe. For a bride, this is AMAZING because you honestly don't have to do much to spice it up. The beauty is in the simplicity. 

I would recommend the Clayton to any bride or event planner because it is hands down, the perfect place for any occasion {PSSSSST, I am an event planner so this is saying a lot!}. ALSO, rumor has it that they're opening another venue around the corner!!!!! This will have a larger capacity if The Clayton on the Park is too small for your guest count. Can I get married again please?!?!? 

Thank you so much to Claire, the amazing culinary team, and to everyone at the venue that made our wedding day absolutely perfect!

e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"What a fun new spot in Scottsdale! They have quite the swanky digs with purple velvet chairs, dim lighting, open-air seating, and more. This concept came from LA and it would be perfect for a fancy occasion, celebration, or night on the town! They do a great job of incorporating all dietary needs into their dishes. Which is unique for a concept like this. There really is something for everyone on their menu. The service was absolutely incredible. Everyone was so smiley, nice, and very attentive! WIN! 

I came for a happy hour meeting where their cocktails were $10 and a variety of bites were $9 - $18. Their cocktails knocked my socks off! I ordered their guava margarita and oh my goodness, it was to die for! Not too fruity or sweet, the perfect balance of all flavors. My colleague got the sangria and that was super tasty as well. My only complaint is that there is a lot of ice, so the drinks go down REAL fast for being as pricey as they are. 

I wasn't overly impressed with their chips + salsa. They bring pico de gallo + chips after you order and I just wasn't the biggest fan of it. I'm more of a smooth salsa kinda gal, I guess! The chips were also a little thick for my liking. Sheesh, who knew I could be so picky about chips and salsa! (Total personal preference) 

Their version of Caprese was the DREAMIEST!!! I could eat this all day, every day and would 100% recommend. We also split their taco box (5 tacos for $18). The presentation is adorable, but the tacos were not that impressive. They come in a tiny corn tortilla with a tiny bit of meat on them, wrapped in foil, and nothing else. Then, you have 2 different salsas, onions/cilantro, and limes on top of the box to put on the tacos. Lastly, we split their queso fundido and that was amazing. It had soy chorizo in it but you would never know it! I also loved the mushrooms in it. Their homemade flour tortillas were also doughy + dreamy. 

All in all, I would come back to try some of their dinner items! Again, definitely for a fancier occasion because of the price point and classy vibes. :) Welcome to Scottsdale!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"My best friend had her birthday party here a few weeks ago on the patio and it was so lovely! The weather was perfect and the ambiance divine. I was so excited when she picked this spot because I had been dying to try it. It is such a great addition to 7th street, and walking distance from so many fun places to hit up after you enjoy a delicious Italian dinner here.

Their patio is small, but shady and perfect for a small group gathering. There were about 24 of us who had dinner. We took up pretty much the entire patio, there were a few more tables besides our party. They had waiters walking around taking orders for the first hour while we drank and mingled. My house chardonnay was refreshing and delicious! I ended up getting a second glass. 

To start, we tried their Antipasto Board that was absolutely incredible! It had an array of meats, smoked salmon, cheeses, veggies, hummus, and toasted flatbread. It is a great starter for a table! While their homemade pasta dishes looked AMAZING, I was trying to stay on the healthy side since I had a week of indulging so I ordered the Cauliflower Steak Polenta from their Gluten Free portion of the menu. It is so neat that they offer great GF options. It was delicious! I did expect it to be a bit different (cauliflower in more of a 'steak' than florets) but the flavors were still fantastic. It had roasted cauliflower on a bed of corn polenta and was topped with loads of wild mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, and fresh basil. Then was drizzled with truffle and olive oil. My ONLY suggestions were that the polenta be a bit creamier (it got a little tough and was kind of dry by the time it got to me) and that there be more of a 'sauce' on it. Otherwise, I ate the entire thing and and enjoyed it! 

All in all, this is a GREAT new spot and I can't wait to come back and try their homemade pastas. The service was super friendly and they were so kind to do individual checks for our huge party which is no easy task. I will be back soon! Also, the owner is SO passionate and was frequently making rounds to check in on all of the tables and offered great food suggestions. Love that!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"I FINALLY made it in to FnB with friends and we had the most wonderful time! We have been dying to try it for so long and can't believe it took us this long to discover the amazingness. The menu is comprised of primarily small plates with a few entree selections as well. It changes regularly based on what is in season, etc. They're very big on supporting local! I love this. I was VERY impressed with the serving sizes of their small plates and they're also willing to adjust sizes based on how many people are in your party.

We had a group of 10 but split our small plates as couples. My husband and I started with their wild Mexican shrimp, tomato juice, serrano, jicama, hominy, avocado, and buttered saltines. It was served cold with 4 giant shrimp and loads of sauce and goodies. It was INCREDIBLE. It tasted just like the authentic shrimp cocktails that I get in Mexico, minus the ocean view. :) Next, we tried their shishito peppers that had a red pepper/romesco type sauce. They were so mild and delicious. Lastly, we split their cold sliced potatoes with eggs and a grain dijon mustard sauce over the top with herbs. LOVED them. However, if you're expecting warm potatoes, not for this one! We ordered entrees as well so 3 small plates + an entree each was a lot of food! We definitely could have stuck with 2 small plates. 

For my entree, I ordered their Creekstone Farms ribeye with a pepper relish, fennel, and wheat berries. The flavors were unique and the sauce almost tasted like a vinaigrette. It also isn't a HUGE ribeye like you would expect, they served it sliced so it is a manageable portion, which I appreciated. The meat was a LITTLE chewy but still had great flavor. 

All in all, we can't wait to come back! The restaurant itself has 4 different small rooms. I would say the biggest party size for a night out with friends would be 10 (we took up most of their main room) and definitely make a reservation. It makes a great date night spot and is very romantic. They have fresh cocktails and a lovely wine list as well. The service was friendly and the server was extremely passionate about FnB and the magic behind their food."
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"I popped in here to get my iPhone 7 Plus screen fixed after finding it cracked (with no idea how it happened) a few nights ago. My husband swears it wasn't him so my only other thought is the dog. ha!

Before going forward with this review, I have to note that this isn't based on the employees who work here - they were very friendly. It is simply based on their business practices. 

Here we go! I requested quotes from multiple different cell phone repair shops in Phoenix and Mac Masters came back the lowest. So, naturally I went to them! ALSO, on their Yelp page, it said that an iPhone screen repair is $69. Or so I thought. 

When I walked in to get it fixed, I was told that $69 was for a smaller iPhone, not mine. I guess I understand that - but then be more specific on Yelp! THEN, the $79 charge that they quoted was for after market glass and they told me that there is a chance that the touch won't be as good as the certified 'Apple' glass for $149. Since I use my phone ALL OF THE TIME for work, I wanted to get the 'Apple' factory glass to prevent anything from going weird or wrong. I can't risk screen probs down the line! 

Guess what, $149 wasn't the final price. They insist that you buy an accessory, otherwise, you would be charged $199. WHAT a $50 up-charge if I don't buy an accessory!? I didn't need anything! The cheapest accessory was a $10 popsocket that I did not want. SO, I got a charging doc that I didn't even need for $20. Therefore, my total cost to get the screen fixed was $171.58. That is almost $100 more than my initial quote!!! This ended up being the SAME PRICE that an Apple store would have charged. 

All of this said, I recommend that they be more up front when giving quotes online. Giving BOTH price/screen options is what customers want to hear. I don't want to be lured in with a low price only to find that it is more than double the quote. When I thought I would save money going to them, I actually ended up spending the exact same amount that I would have if I went to the Mac store. To say I left frustrated would be an understatement. 

SO beyond their friendly service and proper fix of my screen, beware of sketchy quotes/pricing!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"We recently came to Mora for a friend's birthday dinner and had a really wonderful experience! We sat at a long table in the bar area and had two very attentive servers dedicated to our group. 

I started off with a vodka press (SO GOOD HERE if they're your jam), then moved on to red wine with dinner. The cocktails/wine are a tad pricey but that is what you expect when dining at such a nice establishment! Psssst: They do have a great Happy Hour if you aren't on a time schedule! 

To start, we split the bread board and you guys - THIS IS A MUST. If you're like me, you may think, why are they charging for bread at an Italian restaurant?! Well, that is because this is way more than just 'bread'. It is a huge board packed full of a variety of warm country bread, stromboli (YUM!), and focaccia served with the BEST SPREADS EVER! The spreads included an artichoke bomba, mascarpone butter, roasted garlic spread, and eggplant caponata (my fav). We also split their famous Focaccia di Recco - basically an Italian cheese crisp and it, too, is a must order! Both are great for groups!  

Guess what, i'm not done with starters! We also ordered their burrata appetizer and split the antipasti salad. The burrata appetizer was definitely not my favorite - it was basically a small serving of burrata with two tiny croutons. SO, you basically just eat the burrata by itself with a spoon. Not a fan. BUT the salad was a DREAM! I could definitely come back and get it for my meal. If you're getting it prior to your entree, it is definitely big enough to split.

If you didn't already know, all of their pastas are made in house soooo, they're a must. I ordered their Rigatoni Verde that came with a VERY authentic bolognese. In Italy, their bolognese isn't super tomato-y and Mora does it just like you're sitting on the cobblestone streets of Italy. Yes, please! It was amazing. Yep, I licked my plate (even after all of those starters). My husband and I also split a side of beets because we're obsessed with them. They were served warm and were super tasty!

Anywho, we're actually coming back next weekend for another birthday and I cannot WAIT!!!! Thank you for such a great experience, Mora! See you soon!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"I had been to the Village as a kiddo and loved it then, and recently joined as an adult - and i'm loving it even more now! Think spa experience + rejuvenating workout EVERY DAY! Yes, please!

My favorite part beyond their amazing equipment, iced lemon water, and classes, are their locker room amenities. You guys, it doesn't get much better than this! They have daily lockers where you don't need to bring a lock (super easy to use), showers are plentiful with towels, shaving cream, razors (yes, razors), shampoo, conditioner, body gel, lotion, areas to do your makeup with hairspray, deodorant spray, curling irons, blow dryers, q-tips, cotton balls, and makeup remover wipes - literally EVERYTHING! I've never had to wait for a shower or makeup area - ever. It is a dream. But my favorite parts are their sauna, steam room, and jacuzzi. These features are what make you feel like you're at the spa every day. A quick 10 minutes in the steam room after my workout and before showering literally makes me feel so relaxed and rejuvenated. I sometimes bring my therapy ball and rub out knots while in there which is amazing. It is the reward that gets me through my workout.

Okay, it is a gym SO, now on to the classes and equipment. They have an indoor track (SO NICE for the summertime!), loads of classes like spin, yoga, pilates, and various other high intensity options, multiple rooms with weights, cardio machines, rowing machines, loads of floor equipment, etc. I love that there are private little pockets with things to do if you don't like working out in a big room in front of a  lot of people. There are also indoor basketball courts, loads of tennis courts, an outdoor pool with swim classes and water aerobics. Oh and childcare if you have little ones. Like does it get any better than this?! 

The price you pay is definitely more than an 'average' gym but if you're a class lover like me, by the time you add up the boutique classes elsewhere, you're paying WAY more than this without all of the dreamy amenities. I AM SO HAPPY and will be a Village lover for life! :) Also, if you're about to sign up and work for a local company, be sure to check with them because your company may be on their list for additional signup perks! Thank you for keeping my lifestyle healthy and enjoyable!"
e6iCOIhtupBCiw-VwBvJ4A,"All I can say is...WOW. We had the most incredible buying experience at Mark Mitsubishi of Phoenix this past weekend. The sales team is not pushy at all and the prices are the lowest in the Valley when we compared the vehicles that we were looking at. 

We *thought* we were in the market for a certified pre-owned 2016 Honda Pilot EX-L and found one through Auto Trader that was located at Mark Mitsubishi of Phoenix. When we arrived to look at it, we were kindly greeted by Bob. He walked over to the car with us to chat about it. In person, the car had more scratches than I liked {I'm SUPER picky when it comes to purchasing used cars...lets be honest, they basically have to look new}. 

BUT staring at us from across the lot was a GORGEOUS 2015 White Lexus GX460. I jokingly said to my husband, ""what about this one?"". With a giggle, knowing that it was way out of our reach! Well, little did I know, it actually wasn't as far out of our reach as I had thought. I told my husband that it was my dream ""mom car"" in 10+ years. And he said, well then, lets look at it! Why not get your dream car now? ***KEEPER***. ;) 

We took it for a spin, and YUP, it was everything that we wanted and more. It had the towing capacity and truck-like feel that my husband wanted, and the luxury feel that I wanted. We were smitten. As we were pulling back into the lot, I saw another one! This one was a black 2014 GX460, in even BETTER condition than the 2015 and the exact same body style. It literally looked brand new, inside and out. And i'm a sucker for black. It was also more affordable since it had a few more miles on it and was one year older. Well needless to say, we left that day totally unsure about what we wanted. The Lexus put the pilot to shame. {No offense, Honda, I still love you!} We came home and did a TON of research on the Lexus GX460s and literally could not get it out of our head. They body style and features had not changed much between 2014-2017 and there really were no big differences between the years. 

So, I called up Bob and asked to come back and test drive the black one. Good thing, because they had sold the white one previously that afternoon!! Fast forward a few hours and we are now proud owners of a gorgeous Lexus SUV! :) The purchasing process was seamless, they definitely worked with us to meet our monthly budget, and they offered a 50K mile/4 year full luxury warranty AND Gap Insurance which are key when purchasing a pre-owned vehicle. We're in love! We can't stop staring at it. 

Thank you, Bob, and the entire MM of Phoenix team for making our buying experience SO seamless. Bob even called us this morning to thank us for our business and to see if there was anything else that he could do for us. We would highly recommend this dealership for any of your purchasing needs!"
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here last night, a Thursday, with four other guys for dinner.  We were planning on eating at 7 and one of our party arrived there at 6:45 and was told that there was a 50 minute wait.  That ended up being almost spot on as the text message came in at 7:30 telling us that our table was ready.  The inside of BJ's looks quite nice as it is large and fairly open.  On one side of the restaurant is a large well lit and well stocked bar while the rest of the restaurant is for seating.  They also have a large chalkboard menu for their beer selections, a large number of TVs and some random open garage doors as dividers.

To start off the evening I went with a sampler of their beers and picked their Irish red, imperial stout, pale ale and IPA.  All of it tasted pretty good with my favorite of the bunch being the pale ale which had an interesting flavor to it.  After getting our drinks we all put in our entree orders and I went with the sriracha chicken macaroni and cheese.  In the meantime I pulled my silverware out of the napkin and put it on my lap.  The napkin was wet and would ultimately end up getting my jeans uncomfortably damp.  I didn't say anything at the time but at a later point it came up at our table and we found out that four of our five napkins were this way.  Our food ended up taking almost an hour to get to our table.  I chalked it up to the place being busy but whenever we looked around we discovered that no one in our section had food.  Whenever the food was finally delivered it was quite the disappointment as well.  The chicken in my macaroni and cheese was cold (thankfully precooked) while the rest of my dish was luke warm at best.  So I asked the table whose dish we had waited on as one of ours ought to have been hot.  Bizarrely everyone's food was pretty cold and even the deep dish pizza pan that they had carried out to our table with tongs was at room temperature.  My buddy next to me had the wings and took one bite before sending them back because they were cold.  Another friend ate half a shrimp taco before noticing a grey shrimp and stopping.  In the meantime I plowed through my luke warm pasta and cold chicken.  The flavor of the food actually wasn't that bad as i loved the cheese and sriracha with the chicken.  It would have been so much better if it was hot though as who likes cold Mac and cheese?

My buddy who got the cold wings ended up calling the manager over and politely informed him of the issues and asked if there was a problem in the kitchen that night.  The manager informed us that they just got backed up and didn't really say too much else.  His whole visit to our table lasted around 45 seconds and he ended up comping every meal at the table which was nice.  So in the end, all that we ended up paying for was the beer and tip.

The bottom line for me is that I will not be heading back here again in the future.  My friends strongly urged me to give it a 1 star review and I considered it.  While this was certainly one of the least enjoyable dining experiences I have had recently, at least no one that I know of got sick and there was the positive aspect of good beer."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I ate here this past Friday night with my girlfriend and two other dining companions for dinner.  As we headed there I was surprised how far off Butler Street it was located as I was unsure we were headed in the right direction until we ran into it a couple of blocks away.  The inside was cozy with seating for about 40 with kaleidoscopes on each table (sadly they didn't spin) as well as some reliefs made of glass sitting in the windows that reminded me of looking through a kaleidoscope.  We had reservations for 7:30 and got there around that time and were seated immediately.   However, after we were seated it took quite a while for us to get waited on but that was because there was a 20-top sitting right behind us that had come in before us.  I would guess that the place is normally has a reasonable volume level but due to them it was quite loud.

Our group decided to start off the evening with a couple of appetizers to split: the deep fried gnocchi as well as the crab dip.  The deep fried gnocchi was served with a side of marinara sauce for dipping but ended up being a little bit of a disappointment for me as I was looking forward to it after having read how good it was.  It seemed to be covered in a breadcrumb like substance on the outside that was a little bit more firm than the gnocchi but I did not really get the sense of them having been fried.  The crab dip tasted nicely and was served with an ample amount of warm pita to eat it all which was nice.    In addition to all of that I decided to have a cup of the soup of the day which was an apple mushroom soup.  It came out looking like your normal cream of mushroom soup, white and nondescript.   The taste of it was amazing though even though the apple was lost on me as there seemed to be a strong cheese (Romano?) flavor that came through with the earthiness of the mushrooms.  After we finished our appetizers, we had a pretty long wait for our dinners due to the 20-top.  It was long enough that the waiter came over and apologized to us numerous times bringing us complimentary warm pita and house made butter the first time and a complimentary bottle of wine and some more pita the second time.   For my dinner entrée I went with the cow jumped over the blue moon pasta.  It was named appropriately as it was beef over top of a fettuccine pasta with a Gorgonzola cream  sauce.  The beef was cooked nicely and paired well with the delicious and savory Gorgonzola sauce which left me satisfied with our wait for the meal.  Finally for dessert my girlfriend and I decided to split the rosemary shortbread tart.  It had a wonderful tasting rosemary flavored crust underneath a custard top with a little bit of blueberry? syrup on top.  Even though I was fairly full before we ordered it, I gladly helped to finish it off since it was very tasty.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  I enjoyed almost everything about the place from the kaleidoscope décor on the inside to the food and even the fact that it was BYOB.  Hopefully the next time that I go there will not be such a large party which I would hope would make the service quicker."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I ate here this past weekend with my girlfriend and her parents for lunch.  The outside of this place fits into the neighborhood and looks like nothing special.  However, once you step inside though you soon realize that you are a pretty awesome place.  It is a full-fledged fish market complete with a good amount of whole fish as well as a deli type area and even a fish cleaning station where you can actually watch the workers clean fish at.  Most of the workers are also dressed the part with rubber coveralls that you would expect to see on a fishing boat out in the ocean.  The bathroom to the restaurant is in the back and you have to walk through the kitchen in order to get there which I found to be pretty cool.  The whole place is also decorated with fishing related items even including the bathroom which had at a fly rod inside of a case stuffed to the side of the wall. 

The restaurant portion of this place is a confusing whenever you first walk though the door as there are seats strewn about everywhere with a chalkboard menu behind the cashier.  However, after asking a question to the girl behind the counter I was told that I could order at the counter and pick a seat of my choosing and pay at the end.  Since I had heard good things about the sushi here I decided to start off my meal with the Boston Roll and also went with the Broiled Cod Parmesan for my lunch entrée.  It was only after I had ordered and sat down that I noticed a large soup station and became jealous that I did not order some.  My girlfriends parents ended up getting some, a chowder of sorts, and said that it was really good.  After waiting only a short time at the table my Boston Roll was served to me.  It was sliced into eight pieces and had the shrimp, avocado and cucumber on it as promised by the menu.  It tasted excellent and I felt like it was quite a refreshing dish and that it was a good starter for my meal.  Soon thereafter my fish sandwich came out with sides of both slaw and some type of deli salad that had chick peas in it.  I first took a bite of the cod removed from the sandwich in order to get its full flavor and found it to be pretty amazing.  The breadcrumbs gave it a rich crunchy buttery flavoring with the mild flavor of the fish coming through slightly.  After my first bite I was excited to try it on the sandwich as cheese and pasta sauce normally only make things better and whole doesn't love a good Ciabbata?  The bread was good but sadly I was disappointed that the sauce and cheese completely covered the delicate flavoring that I had enjoyed when tasting the fish alone.  Although I still enjoyed the rest of my sandwich I felt like it had the potential to be better.  The deli salad that came with it was also good and while I personally did not enjoy the slaw (slaw always seems to be such a personal taste) my girlfriend really did.  Overall though I really enjoyed my meal and loved the ambiance of this place.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be heading back here in the future.  As a matter of a fact just thinking about having some sushi along with a one of those good smelling soups is making my mouth water."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend for dinner.  We decided to come here since it was the last of the Big Burrito restaurants that my girlfriend had not tried.  The inside of the restaurant is quaint with a sushi bar on one side where you can watch Mr. Shu ply his craft and many tables on the other longer side of the restaurant.  There are also a decent amount of sheet metal fish sculptures throughout the restaurant which I enjoyed looking at.

Whenever our server came over, we queried him about a few of the Umi specials and in addition to the information about the dishes he told us that they were essentially big appetizers which was good to know.  After hearing that we decided to start off our meals with the sawara with garlic ponzu and squid pasta with garlic sauce.  Since we had also both ordered entrees with my girlfriend getting the terayaki salmon and myself the seafood tempura with a side spicy tuna maki, our meals actually started with a miso soup and ginger dressing salad.  There was nothing special with either although I do always enjoy both at many sushi places. Soon after we finished those the sawara came out and it was a Spanish Mackeral cut into 7 pieces with a tiny sliver of raw garlic on top surrounding the garlic ponzu.  We were instructed to wrap the fish around the garlic and dip it into the sauce which we both did.  The combined flavors were very enjoyable with the standout being the sauce.  After that our squid pasta came out which was some squid that looked julienned and then seared with some shitaki mushrooms and asparagus on top of a bed of garlic sauce.  This dish was interesting for me as I was not a big fan of having the squid in the sauce alone but really enjoyed it whenever I combined it with some of the vegetables.  The Shitake mushrooms might actually have been the best that I have ever had as they seemed to melt in your mouth.  After we had finished the plate our server ended up bringing out a side of rice onto which he poured the sauce from our now empty dish.  In doing so he explained that the sauce was too good to waste.  After trying the sauce covered rice my girlfriend and I both readily agreed with him.  Finally after making our way through all of the other courses, our entrees came out.  My seafood tempura ended up consisting of broccoli, asparagus, crab, fake crab and a single piece of fish all breaded in tempura with a side of soy sauce.  This dish was actually the biggest disappointment of the evening for me for a few reasons including the single piece of fish and also that it seemed to lack the depth of flavors that the rest of the dishes so nicely displayed.  Thankfully my maki was delivered at the same time and had a flavor punch that diverted me from the much more vanilla tempura.  Since I am not a huge fan of salmon I did not try my girlfriends dish but she did assure me that she enjoyed it whenever I asked her about it.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely be back in the future.  I am not so sure that I would order an entree again but I would certainly love to try more of their creations and could probably make a meal of their maki and sushi."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my fiancé and two other couples for dinner.  We had reservations and were the first from our party to arrive and were quickly led from the fairly full bar area into the mostly empty dining room.  The table that we were placed at was right underneath a window which for reasons unbeknownst to us or the server, did not have and curtains or shades.  This was a major problem since it was a very sunny day and made it very difficult for some of our dining companions to even look in the direction of my fiancé and myself.  I actually felt bad for the two that were seated in the direction facing the window as they had the sun in their eyes constantly and that could not have been nice.  After we were seated for a bit, the server came over to give us the specials of the day and also mentioned that they were out of the Italian meat plate and duck.  At this point my fiancé ordered a merlot, only to have the server go off to get it and come back to tell her that they were out of it.  The same thing would happen later in the evening whenever one of our dining companions ordered the quail as his entrée.  I don't know that I have ever seen a restaurant out of that many food items, on a Friday night of all times, especially one that is a little more upscale.

Our group decided to start off the evening by trying out two of the ""small plates"", the large artisan cheese plate and a flatbread with a prime rib.  After the small plates came out, we decided to ask our server what kind of cheese was on the cheese plate as the menu did not mention it and we were not able to identify it ourselves.  He had to go back into the kitchen to find out and I wish that I could remember any of them but none were anything that I have heard of before.  Even so, I enjoyed the taste of all 4 different kinds although there wasn't as big of a flavor difference in them as I would have liked.  The flatbread ended up being very good and would ultimately become my favorite dish of the evening.  For my dinner entrée I decided to order the Bloody Mary Marinated NY Strip Steak while my fiancé went with the Surf and Turf.  As soon as we cut into our steaks it was easy to tell that both were overcooked.  However my fiancé would tell me that her scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly.  As for my entree, the marinade that was on my steak was fairly bland and did not provide the flavor that I expected out of it.  My favorite part ended up being the Gruyere potato terrine which was terrific.  It had the potatoes in a long rectangular shape that you would associate with a terrine and seemed to be lightly fried on all sides which helped to give it some crisp and flavor.  

The bottom line for me is that I would not head back here in the future.  While some of the food proved that the restaurant has some promise, there were just too many little things wrong that could have been easily fixed.  Everything from seating a table facing a window on a sunny day without blinds to the number of menu items that they were out of and even overcooking our steaks are things that are very simple to fix and had me leaving Truth Lounge with a sour taste in my mouth."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here this past Wednesday night with my wife for her birthday dinner.  The first thing that you notice when entering the hotel is a beautiful garden themed chandelier.  Once you get past that and start heading toward The Commoner then the noise really starts to pick up and by the time you are downstairs inside the Commoner, as many others have noted, it is quite loud.  I would guess that's because it is a huge open space without much to deaden the noise.  That's not to say that the decor isn't quite cool though as it is.  It has an old school industrial type feel with unstained oak floors, exposed duct work and cool but exposed lighting.  As for the layout there is a bar on one side alongside an open kitchen and a ton of seating in the middle and the other side.  The open kitchen also has bar like seats facing into it that I would love to sit at some time.  

My wife and I were actually using an opentable gift certificate here and we correctly guessed that there wouldn't be any change from it.  So we went big and for appetizers we ordered the turkey poutine, blue crab fritters and giant Bavarian pretzel.  They all came out at the same time and our small 2 top didn't really have the space for it. Even so we made it fit.  Out of the three items I think that the turkey poutine was my favorite.  It was a wonderful play on Thanksgiving dinner as the fries were sweet potato fries, it came with fresh cranberries and then it also had the turkey and gravy on it.  While the fries were a bit soggy by the time that I got to them I thought the flavor of the dish was nice.  The blue crab fritters also tasted pretty good and I thought that the breading gave them a hushpuppy like taste.  It was the pepper jelly on the side that I really enjoyed though as it gave the fritters a nice sweet heat.  Last but not least was the giant Bavarian pretzel which was quite large.  It tasted like a good pretzel would and had large granules of salt on it and came with a beer cheese.  While the beer cheese was good, the small cup (a few ounces at best) of it was very disproportionate to the size of the pretzel and we quickly ran out of it leaving us to finish most of the pretzel without any.  After finishing the appetizers I was getting pretty full but I still had a beef short rib entree coming out next as well as a side of Brussel sprouts and bacon.  My entree came with sides of mashed potatoes and sweet and sour cabbage.  The short rib here was super tender and when combined with the potatoes reminded me of a pot roast, only with much better flavor.  Even though I was struggling to finish my meal because I was so full, the Brussel sprouts with bacon were calling my name because the bacon in it was sliced thicker than most bacon that I have seen.  After all of that we still had some money to spend so even though we weren't hungry in the least, we ended up ordering the sticky toffee pudding.  It came out nice and warm and tasted good enough that even without being hungry we both devoured it.

The bottom line for me is that I would head here again in the future.  I enjoyed the decor of the restaurant as well as the food with my only complaint being the general noise of the place."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I ate here this past Wednesday night with my girlfriend for dinner.  We had been wanting to come and eat at Bistro for awhile and their Pittsburgh Restaurant Week menu finally gave us the push that we needed.  I had made 7:30 reservations a week or so prior to coming here and we a little before that time.  Around 15 minutes later we were seated at our table.  The inside of the restaurant is actually smaller than I expected but clean and modern.  A bar dominates one side while the dining room has most of the other side.

Since it was Pittsburgh restaurant week my girlfriend and I both went with the 3 course pre-fixe menu.  I decided to start out with the braised pork Mac and cheese followed by a coffee crusted mahi mahi before finishing with a coffee panna cotta. My girlfriend started with the pumpkin cappuccino soup followed by the white balsamic chicken with red wine risotto and finished with the butterscotch rice pudding.  Our first courses came out in a short amount of time and looked fantastic.  The flavors on my Mac and cheese were awesome and I was really enjoying it.  Sadly the pork part on it was dried and hard which I didn't mind too much and it still had some good flavors but it was still slightly disappointing.  In the meantime my girlfriends soup was awesome with a rich pumpkin flavor and some spices.  My entree was the coffee rubbed mahi mahi with yucca purée, candied kumquats, coconut rice and some asparagus spears. My favorite part of the meal was eating the kumquats with the yucca purée as the kumquats had a great citrusy sweet and sour quality while the purée was thick and creamy.  The mahi mahi was cooked nicely but I couldn't taste any of the coffee rub which I thought was a shame as the fish was supposed to be the star of this dish.  My girlfriend sad that her chicken was a little dry but that she enjoyed the red wine risotto and could taste some of the wine in it.  Whenever our desserts came, they both looked good.  Since I normally share at least a piece of everything with my girlfriend and vice versa, she thankfully took the first bit of my panna cotta which revealed a chocolate crust to it.  Normally this would not be a big deal except for the fact that I specifically asked our waiter if the panna cotta had any chocolate in it before ordering to which he responded that it did not.  While I did not state the reason for my asking (chocolate gives me migraines), I would think that a waiter who does not know what is in a dessert would go and check as there could be other issues involved.  Instead of having to return the dessert, my girlfriend ended up keeping it and gave me her butterscotch rice pudding which would have been what I would have ordered anyways.  The pudding was good enough but did little to allay my unhappiness over the fact that I could have had a migraine from eating the panna cotta.

The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back her again in the future but I would hope that the servers would be better informed.  Their food by itself probably deserves at least a 4 star rating but I was very disappointed with the fact that the server did not know the menu as it could cause issues in the future, especially if someone has a bad allergy to a food."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I have been to the smallman galley twice now this week, first on Tuesday with my father for lunch and last night with my wife for dinner. First off I have to admit that I am a sucker for the concept here. Get 4 up and coming chefs that probably can't afford their own restaurant space and stick them in 4 separate kitchens right next to each other.  They then have 18 months to refine their concept before they are helped by the smallman galley in finding a space to open their restaurant and a new ""class"" comes in.  The seating and everything else is shared by everyone and its a win for everyone.  In some ways it feels like a cafeteria but don't take that lightly as the food is really good and not at all what you would find in a cafeteria.

Walking into the smallman galley you find yourself in a pretty cool industrial space.  There is exposed ductwork and brick walls with tables fitting right in being made of large planks of wood and the chairs being metal.  Outside of the areas where the kitchen is there is also a large seating and a decent sized bar which happens to have a half off happy M-F 5-7.

The first time that I came here I ended up ordering the Bahn Mi from the Provision Pub. It consisted of chicken skin, liver smear, cilantro, pickles, jalepeno and mayo on a baguette and came with a side of fries.  The fries were excellent and had a nice crispy exterior and soft interior while also being seasoned nicely.  However the Bahn Mi I was a little conflicted about.  I absolutely loved the chicken skin and the crunchy texture that it added to the sandwich.  It was the liver smear which turned me off though as it had a gamey type flavor which was hard to get past.  Then the second time that I visited I went with the provision fries from provision as an appetizer to split with my wife and then decided on the duck from Josephine's Toast.  The fries came out first and were on top of a bed of roasted squash purée and came topped with lentils, goat cheese and a lemon aioli.  Much like my previous visit the fries themselves were cooked perfectly and really great.  All of the toppings on it were pretty good too and my wife an I quickly devoured them.  Then after a bit of a wait my duck entree was ready.  Whenever I picked it up I have to admit that the plating looked great but it was also sort of weird to see this amazing looking dinner over top of a piece of smothered toast.  Knowing that this is her concept I accepted that fact but I feel like the dinner could have easily stood on its own.  The plate consisted of duck on top of a piece of toast with crispy kale, tart cherries and a tart cherry sauce all around it.  I found the duck to be cooked nicely to around a medium and enjoyed the flavor of it.  It was especially good dipped into the tart cherry sauce which I wish I could bottle up.  I also really enjoyed the crispy kale which was had a nice crunch to it.  As I mentioned above the toast was the only thing that I found to be weird about the meal although to be fair it wasn't bad.  I just felt like it didn't really fit into the otherwise delectable gourmet meal.

The bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future.  I love pretty much everything about this place from the ambience to the choice of food and even the food itself."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here a couple of Friday nights ago with my wife and another couple for dinner.  We had made reservations a month in advance (that's all that you are allowed to do) and I had to put my CC in to make the reservation.  Little did I know that i would have been charged $25/person if we didn't show up, which wasn't a problem but should have been advertised somewhere.  In any case, my wife and I arrived about 5 minutes before our reservation and our table was ready for us.  The inside of Alta Via is decent sized although it is definitely smaller than a lot of the other Big Burrito restaurants I have been too.  I didn't really notice much of the restaurant except for our table which consisted of a 3 person booth with a single chair and then some interesting looking wallpaper near us.

For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split the fried calamari for an appetizer which the menu described as fried calamari with crispy Meyer lemons, a parsley aioli and a gremalata.  Since that was our appetizer it came out first and was really good.  The breading on the calamari was nice and light but flavorful while the calamari itself was cooked perfectly.  I also really enjoyed the fried thinly sliced Meyer lemons which allowed you to get a nice pop of acidity.  Then for our entrees my wife and I decided to split 3 small sized pastas: malfaldine, radiatori and the potato gnocchi as well as a roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts.  The menu describes the malfaldine as coming with mushroom bolognese with fresh ricotta , the radiatori as coming with braised Elysian Fields Lamb, Mint, Calabrian chili's and pecorino Toscano, the potato gnocchi as coming with a fennel pesto, and toasted walnuts, Grano Padano Riseva and the roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts as coming with banana peppers, basil, sunflower seeds and crispy garlic.  Whenever our meals came to us we only received 2 of the pastas and the vegetable and I thought the third, the potato gnocchi, was on the way.  It wasn't though and by the time our waitress checked back in with us 15 minutes or so later, most of the food was gone and so I just checked to make sure it wasn't on the bill.  She did offer us a free dessert on her since it was her mistake but we didn't end up taking advantage of that.  In any case the pastas here were both really good.  On the radiatori the lamb was cooked perfectly and paired nicely with the mint while the Calabrian chili's added a good kick of heat to the dish.  Meanwhile on the malfaldine the mushroom bolognese was incredible tasting with a deep and rich mushroom flavor and the ricotta was pretty good too.  What I didn't understand was the roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts.  It wasn't easy to see normal sized pieces sprouts of the cauliflower and they looked more like a garnish than the main part of the dish.  The spice level on it was quite high too and the other couple who had also ordered it left over half of it there.

The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  Alta Via certainly has some good pasta but the rest of my experience was a bit of a let down between not receiving the gnocchi (and not getting checked on for a long time) and not really understanding the roasted Brussels sprouts and cauliflower dish."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here this past Thursday night with three others for dinner.  We arrived shortly before 6 PM and with the nice weather we chose to sit on their patio.  Their patio is rather nice because it has an ample number of seats and looks out over the Allegheny River.  What wasn't so nice about the table that we were seated at was that for a while it was literally the only table out of about 20 or so that had the sun shining on it for about 30 minutes.  That may sound nice but it wasn't really as the sun was in some of my dining companions eyes the whole time.

For dinner three of the members of our party ended up ordering the all you can eat crab legs.  Our opening plates consisted of 2 crab halves (each half was 4 legs and a claw), butter and side orders of french fries and broccoli.  The french fries were actually pretty good and had a nice seasoning on them.  I rather enjoyed picking out some of the crab meat and putting the meat along with some butter over my fries and eating it all at once.  The broccoli on the other hand wasn't to my liking and seemed overly mushy.  As for the crab, well, it was pretty good.  The first couple of halves that they brought out to us were probably either not that fresh or were overcooked.  The reason that I say this is that the meat was hard to get out of the shells and more often than not you were left cracking and picking them.  Later in the evening though the crab seemed to get better (fresher or cooked better?) and was more easily pulled out of the crab without nearly as much cracking needed.  Throughout the night the three of us ended up eating 56 of the crab halves.  What was odd to me is that when we started they were only bringing out 5 or 6 to the table but that by the last two batches they were bringing out 12.  It seems like it would make more sense to do it the other way around as in the end we ended up leaving three of them.  Service of the crab was fairly consistent and it seemed like they were always putting in more orders for us.  However, the smaller amount of crabs meant that there was often waits of up 15 minutes between us finishing the crab and getting some more.  During one of these periods and having already been at the table for more than 2 hours I asked if I could get a refill on the fries.  I wasn't sure if they were included or not but figured that I would give it a try as the fries had to be cheaper and more filling than the crab.  The waitress told me that she would do what she could but never ended up bringing them out.  We finally ended up finishing out meals just before 9:30 PM and they quickly cleaned off our table.  At that point I was pretty antsy to get out of there since we had already been there for 3 1/2 hours.  That wasn't to be though as it took over 35 minutes for us to get the check and then another 10 to get it paid.  So the total amount of time spent at the restaurant was a ridiculous 4 hours and 15 minutes.  Yes I realize that eating a ton of crab legs is a labor intensive activity but I would like to think that we could have been in and out of the restaurant in 2 and a half hours or maybe 3 hours tops.

The bottom line for me is that I don't know if I would be back again in the future.  While the food itself was decent, the total amount of time that I spent here for dinner was absolutely insane."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I ate here this past weekend with my girlfriend and her father for dinner.  We called 2 days prior to our visit in order to try and get reservations at 7 PM.  It didn't exactly work out for us since it was a weekend night and we ultimately decided on the 6:30 PM reservation whenever that or a 9 PM was offered instead.  I can't say that I have ever really noticed Dish before even though I have to have been past it before.  It's a fairly nondescript building on a corner a couple of streets off of Carson.  We arrived right around our dining time and were told that we would have to wait a few minutes for our table.  The restaurant is pretty well divided into two different areas with one side of the restaurant being the bar and the other side a dining room.  Whenever we walked into the dining there was only one other couple inside and so I ended up being confused about our wait other than trying to get us to order drinks.  At least it wasn't a long wait I suppose.  The dining room itself was fairly small and I think that it could maybe seat 30 or so people.  Overall the whole restaurant was pretty unassuming and the only real thing that I noticed about the dining room were some bottles on a shelf on one side of the dining area.

For dinner we all decided to split the Crostini alla Scamorza which was toasted ciabatta bread with smoked mozzarella, prosciutto, mushrooms and fresh basil while my girlfriends father also opted for the pasta e fagioli.  While we were waiting for the soup and appetizers to come out, they provided us with some pieces of bread as well as an small vessel that had some balsamic on the bottom and olive oil on top.  It was good but I was surprised how much of a bite the olive oil had in it.  After a short amount of time both the crostinis and soup were delivered.  The crostini looked like a cheesy bread but ended up tasting more like a cheesy bread on steroids.  While the tops of the crostini were covered in delicious prosciutto and cheese, the mushrooms on top gave it some good earthiness and the basil a good flavor.  Sadly there were only three crostinis as I am sure that I would have liked some more of it.  For our dinner entrees I ordered the Tagliatelle ai Funghi which was Fresh tagliatelle with shiitake, portobello, oyster, pioppini and cremini mushrooms in extra virgin and garlic with spinach, basil and Parmiggiano Reggiano while my girlfriend went with the Linguine ai Frutti di Mare.  Whenever they were brought to the table I thought that the portions looked a bit small but the bowls ended up being deceiving as they were deeper than they looked.  My girlfriends dish came covered in many different types of seafood which you would expect and tasted really good.  Mine was also excellent and I loved that the noodles were cooked al dente and were a bit denser than I had been expecting.  It also carried much of the same flavors that I so enjoyed with the crostini and before long there was nothing left on my plate and I was full.  My girlfriend and her father both commented on how much they enjoyed their meals and we all left satisfied.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be heading here again in the future.  I like that almost everything about it is low key and yet it still provides excellent food while also being cheaper than I had originally expected."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend and her parents.  We had an 8:30 reservation and arrived a few minutes early only to be told that they were 15 minutes behind schedule and that we could wait outside or at the bar next door.  This wasn't the most thrilling option for us as we did not want to go to the bar which meant that we we stuck outside with all of the smokers from the nearby bar which we thoroughly despised.  At first I was pretty peeved by our wait but as the host repeatedly apologized for the delay throughout the night and I realized that they had a 40+ person wedding party upstairs and a 20 top downstairs, it easily became apparent that they were not really to blame.  The restaurant itself is fairly quaint with the tables being made from slate(?) with some inlaid artwork and also some other local artwork for sale on the walls.

Having been here before we knew that Sausilido was BYOB and brought in our own bottle for a nominal $2/person corkage fee which the waiter opened while telling us about the daily fish and risotto specials.  Our group decided to start off our evening smoked gouda.  Before it was delivered to the table we received the local bread and bean dip that is served with all of their entrees.  The bread was nice and the bean dip even better which led to be it being finished before our appetizer even made it to the table.  The gouda was served with a crust on the outside and was topped off by some pesto while sitting on a bed of spinach.  It came sans bread which our table thought was odd but may have been due to the fact that we already ate all of ours.  Once we tasted it though, the bread was not missed as it was both savory and delicious which allowed it to be enjoyed by our whole party.  Shortly after our appetizer was finished, the salads that came with all of the entrees were delivered.  They were decent sized and dressed in a tasty vinegarette.  I really enjoyed it, especially the beets which you so rarely get on house salads.   For my entree I had a tough time deciding between the hangar steak and duck breast before ultimately settling on the hangar steak.  Whenever our entrees came out, everyone at the table commented on how large they were.  I was also surprised to see that in addition to the steak, bacon horseradish creme fraiche and warm potato salad that was described on the menu, they had garnished my dish with a sizable portion of roasted cauliflower and red peppers.  All of my dish was excellent with the warm potato salad tasting awesome while the steak was cooked perfectly and the extra vegetables being good as well.  My only complaint would be the large scoop of creme fraiche that seemed ladled onto my steak.  That in itself would not have been too bad except for the fact that the horseradish seemed to be heavy in it and overpowered all of the other flavors.  Thankfully I enjoy horseradish and so did not find it to be too horrible even though it was even a bit much for me on several of the pieces that I had eaten.  With all of the food that we had eaten, we were not able to order dessert and even passed on our planned trip to the nearby froyo store afterward.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again.  Every time that I come to this place I am reminded of why I constantly have it as one of my top 5 restaurants in the 'burgh."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here last night with my fiance for dinner.  I have been by this place many times before as it sits right near the entrance to my old high school stadium where I still run quite a bit and somehow I have never though to go here.  That's probably because it really isn't much to look at from the outside and it shares the building with a beer distributor on the other side.  Anyways, I was looking at Yelp the other day and saw someone post some good things about it and decided, man, I should probably head there.  So my fiance and I decided to walk in not really knowing what to expect.  The inside is a decent looking space with 8 tables (I counted because there was one waitress) and then a counter.  Its only problem being that it looks very dated, like it was probably put in about 30 years ago dated. That's not to say it was too bad since it still looked and felt clean.  Above the counter there is also a TV which had both the Pirates game and then preseason Steelers game on it while we there.  

For dinner I decided to go with one of there specials for the evening and ordered the bourbon bbq bacon pork chop which came with potato pancakes and a salad.  Whenever I asked if they had a vinaigrette, the server actually gave me a choice of three from which I chose the balsamic.  Before our salads came to the table our waitress brought us some bread which looked to be covered in some sort of oil and covered in cheese.  It was excellent as the oil had some garlic in it and the bread was a little crispy.  We ended up eating it all up before our salads came and our waitress asked if we wanted some more with our dinner which we readily agreed to.  Our salads weren't bad as they had some darker looking lettuce and none of the iceberg that you normally find.  They also were topped with onions, tomato and olives.  The overall taste of them wasn't too bad although I thought that my vinaigrette was a bit sweet.  After we finished our salads our meals were brought out.  My pork chop was thick but not very large, wrapped in bacon and had the BBQ sauce on top as promised.  The potato pancakes were also on the plate as well as some carrots and broccoli which was a surprise to me since they weren't mentioned.  I will admit that I don't like cooked carrots much so I won't really comment on them but the broccoli was decent and tasted a little of butter.  My potato pancakes were surprisingly good as they had some spices in them that made them interesting and actually made me regret getting some sour cream with them since it covered up the flavor a bit.  Finally my pork chop was also pretty good.  I could really taste the sweetness of the bourbon in the BBQ sauce and it went great with the saltiness of the bacon.  My pork chop was also cooked pretty well although some of it was a bit dry.  Overall though it was a successful meal.  I have to admit that I was also very impressed with the waitress as she was waiting on seven tables at a time and never really seemed to be in the weeds.  Granted everyone straggled in at different times but I still found it to be impressive.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  My only real complaint with Bella Ria's is that I think we paid a little much for what we ended up getting ($17 for the special I think).  Even so, I did enjoy my meal and know that my fiance did as well."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here this past Saturday evening with my wife for dinner.  Spoonwood Brewing had been on my list of bookmarks for quite a long time but we never seemed to be able to head there.  So I was pretty stoked whenever we finally found the time although I wasn't nearly as excited about the fact that we would be arriving at 6 PM on a Saturday night.  As expected, the place was absolutely mobbed and there was a wait list which we put our name on and were quoted 20 minutes.  While we waited my wife and I checked out the space which seemed quite nice.  There is a large bar in one corner and then a massive open concept throughout the rest.  As if that wasn't enough they also have some outdoor seating on a deck which is complete with a stage.  It would ultimately take us about 30 minutes before we were seated which was weird as there were a few empty tables and they just seemed to be behind on their bussing.

For dinner on this evening my wife and I were torn between the BBQ and their pizza.  As a compromise we decided to each get an item and then to split them with each other.  So for my dinner entree I went with the pick 3 BBQ and chose hot links, pulled pork and chicken.  It came with cornbread and two sides for which we chose collard greens and Mac and cheese.  For the pizza we decided on the choke & chicken which the menu describes as pulled chicken, pesto, grilled artichoke heart, garlic ricotta, house-made mozzarella, arugula, lemon juice.  While all of that was in I also decided to sample four of their beers and went with the marmalade wheat, cold city drip, smoke & oats and killer diller.  All four of them were decent beers but it was the smoke and oats with its smoked flavor that won me over out of the bunch.  While I was still sampling the beers our food came out sans the collard greens which I didn't notice right away. During this time they had also brought BBQ sauces out and had Carolina, sweet and hot.  Out of all them the hot was my favorite but I can't say that I would buy any of them if they had been bottled.  In any case I worked my way into the BBQ first and felt somewhat unimpressed by the pulled pork.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either.  Next up was the hot links which actually had a great flavor to them.  My problem with them is that they wouldn't hold their shape though and fell apart whenever I cut into them making them difficult.  Last but certainly not least for the meats was the chicken.  I have to admit that this was the protein I was least looking forward to.  Boy did it surprise me as it was easily the best.  It was moist and juicy while carrying a smoky flavor that I loved.  The sides for our dish ended up being good as well with the collards being cooked until tender with some bacon while the Mac and cheesy was creamy and tasty.  Finally I tried the pizza and I can't say that I was impressed at all.  The crust had that wood fired flavor to it but something about it didn't seem right.  It wasn't crispy underneath like it should have been and I would have to say that the bottom was undercooked.  The toppings did little to impress me either and I actually left a quarter of my pizza, which if you know me, I never ever do.

The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't head back here again in the future.  Yeah everything was ok but I didn't think it was worth the wait and the food and beer weren't worth the hype."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here a couple of Sundays ago with a group of 6 people included my wife and her immediate family.  My sister in law was the person that chose Mother Bunch Brewing and since we didn't know how busy it was going to be, we made reservations.  Those reservations weren't really necessary as the place was only half full whenever we got there.  If I had to describe the inside I would call it super trendy.  It had exposed ductwork and rafters and an exposed brick wall with a large mural on it and other parts had paintings.  There was a large u shaped bar whenever you walked in along with a lot of table seating.  We ended up getting sat on the side of all of this where there were giant pew benches on both sides of the table.

As I often do whenever I visit a new brewery, I decided to have a flight.  At Mother Bunch Brewing this consists of four tasters ($2 each), your pick.  I ended up choosing the pina loca gose, leftover karma IPA, mother IPA and hoppymoto IPA.  The pina loca gose was the first beer I tried and it started off with a little sourness before finishing with the sweetness from the pineapple and the dryness you get from every gose.  Up next was the leftover karma IPA which started off nice and smooth before finishing with some pineyness and hops.  Third was the mother ipa which started off hoppy which continued through to the finish with some sweetness along with some citrus on the finish.  Last but certainly not least was the hoppymoto imperial IPA which started off with some sweetness before heading to a a strong hoppy finish.  Out of the bunch I think that the gose was my favorite closely followed by the mother IPA.

We also ate dinner here and for my appetizer I decided on the MB beer Mac trio and then went quite a bit healthier with my entree choice of the seasonal vegetable hotpot.  The menu described the beer Mac and cheese as small portions of our house-made cheddar sauce spiked with MB ale, spicy sriracha tri-tip*, and Bleu cheese with bacon and then the vegetable hotpot as a ragu of fresh garden vegetables in a smoky bell pepper, garlic and tomato sauce that is served over polenta cakes.  My Mac and cheese came out first and holy crap was it delicious!  Each and everyone one of them was creamy and super delicious in their own way.  On the beer one you really got a hit of the ale while the blue cheese one had the smokiness of the bacon along with a very forward blue cheese flavor and the sricha one was legit spicy!  Out of the bunch I think I liked the spicy one the best closely followed by the blue cheese, but honestly I would have been happy to make any of them my meal.  After I had finished the Mac and cheese, my entree came out and also looked good.  It was definitely a very vegetable forward dish which is exactly what I wanted.  The sauce definitely had a bit of a back end kick to it along with a bit of smokiness and the polenta cakes did a good job of soaking it up.  All of the vegetables were cooked nicely and it was quite the filling meal.  However it would be wrong of me not to admit that I was jealous of everyone at our table who ordered the burgers.  They looked quite large and tasty and they each came with a crazy amount of fries on the side.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  Both my beer and all of the food that I had here was really good and I will be sure to order a burger the next time!"
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here this past Sunday with my wife and sister for brunch.  We were not originally planning on coming here and after having to call an audible we arrived shortly before 11 to find a huge line outside of Zenith.  It was large enough that I was concerned we weren't going to get seated in the first wave of people for brunch.  Having been here a couple of times before I knew that if we didn't make it into that first wave then we could be in for a long wait.  Thankfully we eventually did make it and were seated at a table for six.  Zenith is quite interesting in that they have a number of tables in the dining room but they are all communal tables and so they pack in as many people as they can.  As such the three of us ended up sharing our table with another couple and a regular.  The inside of Zenith is quite different than any other restaurant you have ever been to before.  The front of the store also happens to be a thrift/antique store which you can peruse either while you wait or after your meal.  That store happens to spill into the restaurant as well and there are numerous random items around you that are on sale.  On my most recent visit two of the more random items were a 4 feet tall cardboard cutout of Santa that I was sitting next to and then a couch with a naked mannequin on it which was high up in front of our table.  The bathroom that I used here was also somewhat creepy as it had hundreds of owls in it all of which were sort of watching you while you did your business.  All of this was mentioned not to say anything bad about Zenith but merely to point that it is different which ends up being part of the charm of Zenith.

If you have never been to brunch here before you get a drink (coffee/tea/iced tea), access to the buffet and then a entree item all for a single price.  The buffet is where I think that Zenith really shines.  It has a large number of cold salads, some bread and finally a number of different cakes and pies on it.  During this visit I was able to try an array of different items and the ones that really stood out for me were the grape leaves, a green potato dish (sorry they don't have names or descriptions on the cold salad items) and finally the vanilla cake.  Where I think Zenith is less successful is their entree items.  On this visit I ended up choosing the homemade beefy seitan sandwich with lettuce and vegan mayo as my entree.  I don't know what I was really expecting here but it wasn't the shaved seitan sandwich that resembled a roast beef sandwich.  Even so I dove into it and I ended up thinking that the seitan in this sandwich tasted somewhat weird.  I have had seitan in many forms before and normally really enjoy it but for some reason this one just didn't do it for me.  Neither did the rice side that came with all of their entrees and was left by almost every person at our table.  With all of that being said I think that I chose poorly for my entree as I was able to try my wife's jakarta wrap which was really delicious.  It consisted of sweet and spicy tofu, fresh spinach, shredded carrots, raisins, sunflower seeds and peanut sauce with the tofu rightfully being the star of the dish.

The bottom line for me is that I will head back here again in the future.  While I hate having to get here early and wait outside for brunch, I think that it is well worth it and that Zenith is a brunch place that every Pittsburgher should try at least once!"
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here this past Friday night with my wife and another couple for dinner.  Since we couldn't make reservations, my wife and I arrived right around 6 PM with the hopes that we would be able to a get a table at around 7 which is when the other couple was scheduled to meet us.  Thankfully the hostess was able to help us.  She took down my phone number and put us in the system for 7 while telling us that we could go upstairs to have a drink.  We did just that by walking down the stairs and then taking the elevator up to the rooftop beer garden.  At just before 7 I received a text message to my phone saying that my table was ready. Unfortunately the set up here is not that great if you are waiting for a table at Mezzo in the beer garden.  First you have to wait for the slow elevator to take you down from the roof and the kicker here is that it won't stop at the second floor even if you press the button.  So then you have to go down to the first floor in order to walk back up to the second floor even though there is clearly a place you could exit the elevator on the second floor.  Anyways, the inside of Mezzo is decorated pretty nicely.  It has some exposed brick walls with painted on graphics, a bar and seating for probably around 40 people or so.  We were sat in one of the corners of the restaurant at a booth with a view overlooking Penn Ave.  What was cool was that it looked like in warmer weather that the second floor windows could be opened up.

For dinner our table decided to start off the evening with the large Charcuturie platter as well as a large bread basket.  Both the charcuterie platter and the bread basket were brought out at the same time and each was explained by a different staff member.  The bread basket ended up having three pieces of three different kinds of breads and came with sides of a honey butter and a peppernota.  I can't remember all three types of breads but I do know that the cheese one (maybe a pecorino) was the best and that I also enjoyed the slightly spicy peppernota on it.  As for the charcuterie platter, WOW!  There were about 10 different kinds off meats as well as some crostinis, pickled onions and a cherry dipping sauce.  I don't think that there was a single thing on it that I didn't enjoy although my favorite meats were probably the Sopresetta and prosciutto.  I also really enjoyed the pickled onions and cherry sauce.  After we finally finished almost all of our appetizers our entrees came out.  My wife and I ordered the seafood risotto and also the tartufo pizza with the intention of sharing them with each other.  The seafood risotto was pretty good with many pieces of both octopus and squid in it as well as a few shrimp.  However, I still preferred the pizza and its mushrooms and cheeses.  There was an ever present smell of truffle on the pizza which was nice and the ricotta and fontina made a nice backdrop for it.  With the amount of food that we had consumed from the  appetizers we were not able to finish either entree and had about half of each to take home.  That didn't stop us from ordering dessert though and we ended up going with a blood orange custard like dessert where the custard was served frozen.  While I wasn't getting too much of the blood oranges flavors from it I did think that it tasted like a creamsicle and enjoyed both the taste and the interesting texture of it.

The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  I really enjoyed the charcuterie platter and all of the other food was good as well!"
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here yesterday with my wife for brunch.  I had read about Amazing Cafe somewhere and after seeing all of the good reviews on Yelp, I had bookmarked it to try for bruch.  Other than knowing that I wanted to try it for brunch, my wife and I meandered in to the Amazing Cafe with little other knowledge of it.  My first impression of the cafe was that the inside was fairly unremarkable with a couple of chalboard menus, some high top tables and also some regular tables.  After quickly taking in the surroundings my wife and I looked around for a moment waiting to be seated until I noticed a big ""order here"" sign over top of a cash register.  So we proceeded over to the cashier and perused the chalkboard menu in front of us.  I think that they had 12 items on the menu of which 3 were only available for brunch while 3 more were only available Tues-Fri.  Since there was someone in line behind us my wife and I both ended up hurriedly ordering the Kindness (Potato hash, roasted tomato, mushrooms, tempeh, greens and miso ""mayo"").  I also asked for a glass of water and was shown where I could pour myself a cup and get my silverware and napkins.  With that done my wife and I took a seat while waiting for our food.  It was at this point that I started to look over the menu a bit more and noticed that the menu was completely vegetarian and it wasn't until I noticed the quotes around ""mayo"" from the kindness before I finally realized that we were in a vegan establishment.  I point this out not because I don't like vegan food but rather because they still had a decent selection of food on their limited menu.  While waiting for our food I started to look around the place a bit more and really enjoyed the quote on the wall that said something like ""I really wish I wouldn't have eaten healthy today"" --said no one ever.  After a reasonable period of time our food ended up coming out.  It looked pretty good as it came in a large bowl and was colorful from the red of the tomatoes and green of the greens.  Even though it had a great appearence I still wasn't expecting that much from it.  How wrong I was though as it was absolutely delicious!  I really enjoyed the miso ""mayo"" which I think gave a great spice to the dish and also liked the different varieties of mushrooms (3 I think) and greens (2).  The most surprising part of the dish for me was the tomatoes.  Getting me to eat a tomato is normally a tough sell as I don't really care for the flavor.  However since it was one of the main components on my dish I was obligated to try it and took a small piece.  I ended up being pleasantly surprised by the rather sweet and appealing flavor of it.  As a matter of a fact I ended up happily eating all of the tomatoes on my dish which I don't think that I have ever done before.  The potatoes and tempeh were also pretty good although at times it was tough to tell which was which until you put it into your mouth since they were both white and cubed to the same size.  By the time that I had finished eating I had once again happily joined the clean plate club.  My wife also became a member a short while later and was also pleased with her entree selection.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I have to admit that I was rather surprised by this place.  My initial thoughts were of the limited menu and the prices ($12 for the kindness) we were paying.  The longer that I sat there though the more that I warmed up to the place and in the end the spectacular food really won me over."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I ate here this past weekend with my girlfriend, her friend and her parents for lunch.  This restaurant sits right on 19 in the middle of West View but is easy to miss if you aren't looking for it.  I am sure that I had run by it many times before noticing the sign one day.  After perusing through the website I decided that if I wanted to eat lunch there that I should probably make reservations and so I did.  Whenever you first walk into the place you actually walk into the gift shop.  We didn't spend much time in there as we were greeted almost immediately and upon giving our name were taken to our seats in another room.  Since it was December the tearoom was decorated for Christmas and it ended up feeling like we were in a cozy house with many different tea sets.  

After we were seated the waitress first took our tea order so that it would have time to steep.  The tea list is quite large here with what I think is about 50 or so teas and so everyone at the table decided to get a different flavor of hot tea.  What was disappointing is that they were out of one of the teas (Maui Tropical Melon which had apparently been discontinued) that our party had ordered and they also did not have a soup of the day on the day that we visited.    For my tea I decided on the Snowfire which was supposed to be a combination of bing cherry and ginger.  In preparation for the tea our waitress lit some tea lights (so that is where the name comes from!) that were encased in a slotted holder and took our order.  Our table decided to split the artichoke dip as an appetizer I went with the Italian Mufaletta sandwich with the side salad and a balsamic vinegarette.  Shortly after taking our order the tea came out.  The tea pots were pretty cool as they had a contraption where a sponge was affixed underneath the spout to prevent the tea from dripping and were put on the slotted holder in order to stay warm.  As my tea was poured it smelled strongly of cherries which made me excited to taste it.  While it was good and had a cherry flavor, it was not as strong as I would have liked and I could not really detect any ginger.  I should probably mention here that I often have a difficult time detecting everything that they say is in some wine as well so this could have just been me.  Our artichoke appetizer came out next and was a big plate of dip surrounding by some dainty crackers.  The dip itself was really good with large chunks of artichoke which provided a nice little sourness that went great with the savory cheese.  Even though we were putting large amounts of the dip on the crackers, they didn't last through and we ended up having a portion of dip left with nothing to put it on.  This later proved to be a boon to me as I would eat the rest of it with a spoon after I had finished my lunch.  Our entrees came out a time later and I thought had a nice plating.  On mine the sandwich was on one half of the plate while my salad was actually inside of a tea cup on the other side.  Both my salad and my mufaletto were good and I especially loved the balsamic dressing that they had here as it was a bit more sour than your typical one.  Everyone else also said that they enjoyed their meals and by the time lunch was done my girlfriend and her mother were discussing a time when they could come back and have a proper tea.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While the portion sizes were a bit small for my liking (it is a tearoom and so it was not that unexpected) I did enjoy all of the food that I had here and my tea was pretty good as well."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here a couple of Fridays ago with my fiance and 2 other dining companions.  We had made reservations earlier in the week but whenever we arrived it was obvious that we didn't need them as at least 75% of the restaurant was open and never did fill up.  The inside is decorated tastefully with neutral colors and dark woods  with the white linen table cloths that you would expect from a finer dining establishment.  

Our waitress came over to greet us in a reasonable time period and asked if we had ever been there before.  After hearing all of say no, she told us that she would get us some of their meatballs on the house while taking our drink order.  I ended up going with a bourbon drink that was really good and whose name I wish that I could remember.  One of our dining companions ended up going with a wine that she wasn't too fond of.  After she had mentioned it the waitress came over and asked her what was wrong with the drink.  After some cajoling she got it out of her that she wasn't a big fan of the wine and even brought over a sample of a different wine that she would happily replace it with.  I guess it my dining companions face that gave away her thoughts about the wine but it almost seemed like they had a microphone on the table.  The service was that good and it stayed that way throughout our dinner. In the meantime we put in our food orders with my fiance and I decided to split the calamari Diavolo as an appetizer, while I went with the Delmonico Steak & Frites for my entree and then the truffle macaroni sounded good enough that we also decided to split that as a side.  First up for the food was the order of meatballs for both couples (it ended up being a large meatball for each person) at our table.  They were covered in a marinara type sauce and were a great start to the meal.  The meat was moist, tender and juicy and went well with the marinara sauce.  Next up was the calamari diavolo which was awesome.  Since I am a fan of spiciness, I absolutely love it whenever they put banana peppers with calamari as they did here.  The spiciness does well to pair with the mild sweetness of the calamari.  It was all covered in a San Marzano tomato sauce which was nice.  The taste of it was awesome and I think that it was probably my second favorite calamari in Pittsburgh.  The only thing that I didn't enjoy about it was that the breading got a bit soggy with the sauce but I easily overlooked that due to the taste.  Our entrees came next with the side of truffle macaroni.  My steak was pretty enormous and I was impressed with the size of it while the frites that came beside it had a nice truffle smell to them.  The steak was cooked perfectly to the medium that I has asked for and was juicy and delicious.  The frites were also very good as the smell and taste of the truffle helped to elevate them beyond your normal frites.  Last but not least was the truffle macaroni which ended up being my least favorite portion of the meal.  It was more of a watery macaroni and cheese with the truffle oil and although I thought it tasted ok, it was not nearly at the same level as the rest of our meal was.  After we had finished our meal the waitress asked all of us if we wanted to take a look at the dessert menu.  While we acquiesced, I knew that I wasn't going to get anything as the meal had left me completely stuffed.

The bottom line for me is that I would head here again in a heartbeat.  Yes the prices are a bit more than some other places but the food was excellent and the service was the best that I have had in a long time.  As the old adage goes ""you often get what you pay for"" and I think that Donato's was well worth the money."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here last night with my fiance and 2 other dining companions for a late dinner.   My fiance and I arrived right around 8:30 PM to a completely empty restaurant.  The downstairs of the restaurant is a bar area with a couple of tables that can only seat three people.  As I looked around a little worried about the seating situation, our server came out and asked how many?  Whenever we replied with 4 she pointed to some stairs and said that we could sit upstairs.  Since she didn't come with us we were free to seat ourselves wherever we wanted.  The upstairs of this place is actually quite nice and reminded me of a room used to host nice parties.  There were white table clothes on all of the tables along with white chair covers and black bows.  The only oddity was the flat screen TV on one of the walls which had on a foreign station (Uzbecki perhaps?) playing music videos.  While it seemed a bit odd at first, everyone eventually ended up enjoying the music.

Since none of us had ever had Uzbek halal before the table decided to split a couple of appetizers to start off with.  We went with the eggplant roll, julien in pancake bags and finally a double order of the homemade bread.  Both the eggplant roll and julien in pancake bags come out together before our meals.  We were actually debating about whether we should order the pancake bags or something else whenever we had placed our order but after it arrived we were more than happy to have to stuck with our decision since it was delicious.  It did indeed look like a pancake bag whenever it arrived at our table and seemed to have the consistency of Injera.  The inside of the bag was filled with mushroom, beef and a creamy sauce all of which was delicious.  Meanwhile the eggplant roll consisted of some eggplant rolled up around tomato and garlic with dill on it.  It was decent but paled in comparison to the bags.  For my entree I went with the Kavsar (You can't go wrong ordering a restaurants namesake, right?) while my fiance went with the Gampam and our dining companions went with Chuchvara and Lagman with each couple also ordering a lamb kabob.  It was nice to see all of the different dishes whenever they arrived at the table with the double order of homemade bread.  The kavsar is roasted meat sausage rolled with whipped eggs and cheese steamed with some bell peppers and I choose mashed potatoes as my side.  It ended up having a pretty good flavor and it reminded me quite a bit of stuffed cabbage with the cheese and egg taking the place of the cabbage.  I was also able to taste both my fiances Gampam(rice topped with rich and delicious broth with vegetables, asian spices and beef tender loin) and our friends Chuchvara (handmade small boiled dumplings filled with ground beef and chopped onions) with the spices in the Gampam making it my favorite of the three entrees I tried.  The kabob was also excellent and sort of reminded me of peppered beef jerky.  That's not a bad thing in my book though as I do love that flavor.  The homemade bread was also really good with a unique shape and a good thick crust around it and a soft inner filling.  Finally for dessert my fiance and I ended up splitting the dessert of the day which was a honey cake.  The server was unable to describe it to us but being adventuous, we ordered it anyways.  I would describe it as a multi layered sponge cake with a strong taste of honey in the frosting and both my fiance and I thought that it tasted pretty good.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  The restaurant itself ended up looking pretty good inside, our server was nice and all of the food was had was both different and good."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here this past Saturday evening with my fiancé and 2 other dining companions for dinner.  Upon entering Butcher and the Rye I was sort of surprised by the décor but also thought that it was pretty cool with the first thing catching my eye the large and tall displays of Whiskey behind the bar.  Since we arrived about 5 minutes after our reservation time (crazy theater traffic) we were immediately shown to our table and I didn't get to see as much downstairs as I would have liked.  As we headed up the first set of stairs I thought it was cool that they had a couple of different levels and then we headed up to a third level which had a bar and some lounge type seating.  We ended up being sat in the lounge type seating which meant that my fiancé and I were stuck on a long couch that had a back about 2 feet behind us while our dining companions were stuck on some tiny stools.  What kind of table is that for people that made their dinner reservations 6 weeks earlier?  By the time we had finished dinner and our desserts I was more than ready to have something to lean my back against.  Other than the weird seating that we were provided the top floor was pretty cool and gave all of us a hunting lodge type feel including a wood ceiling that made you feel like you were in a log cabin.

I decided to start off my evening with one of their cocktails since I had read many people raving about them on Yelp.  So I went with the Butcher Sour which consisted of Bulleit Rye, an egg white, lemon and bitters.  It was a pretty good drink which I enjoyed sipping throughout dinner. For dinner I decided on splitting the mac n cheese and Brussels sprouts with my fiancé while getting the dirty pasta for myself.  After we had ordered the waitress told us that items here come as they are ready from the ktichen and she certainly wasn't kidding.  First up was the mac n cheese which was pretty amazing.  As a matter of a fact I think it might be the best mac and cheese that I have had in Pittsburgh.  It was very decadent and rich with a number of different cheeses that had the perfect amount of gooiness to them.  In the middle of eating the mac and cheese our Brussels Sprouts came out.  They were also delicious with the sprouts being cooked very crispy with the brown butter, parmesan and lemon aioli giving them some nice depth although honestly they were good enough that I probably could have been just as happy without most of that.  As we were finishing that the Dirty Pasta's came out and so there were two of us eating our main dishes while the others had nothing in front of them.  The dirty pasta was easily my least favorite dish of the evening and consisted of ground duck, strozzapretti, sage, brandy and pecorino romano.  It started out well enough and I loved the ground duck but eventually the salt in the sauce became too much for me and by the end of the bowl I was not enjoying it at all.  I was also able to try my fiancés wagyu flank steak which was cooked nicely and which she loved.  After we had all finished our meals both of the ladies at our table ordered deep fried brownie for dessert.  After a fairly long wait and an apology from the waitress the brownies were delivered to the table.  Both of the ladies raved about how good they were with the outside of the brownie being a little hard while the inside was gooey.

The bottom line for me is that I can't really see myself coming back to the Butcher and the Rye too soon in the future.  While some of my dishes like the Brussels and mac and cheese were absolutely amazing I can't say that I was too happy with my main dish nor with our seating.   My fiance also encouraged me to give this 4 stars as she enjoyed her experience but mine was a little less enjoyable with my too salty main dish."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here this past 4th of July with my wife and two other couples for dinner.  Our group leader had made reservations for this table in May and had specified a window table and so we were interested in seeing what we we got.  My wife and I arrived to Vue 412 at 7:15 even though our reservations weren't until 8 PM as we wanted to get a drink at the bar.  As we drove up the restaurant I was looking for a valet.  Unfortunately there wasn't one which means that I was left to park on my own on Mt Washington on the 4th of July.  Ugh!  Thankfully I was able to secure one of the 3 spots left in the parking lot across the street even if we got gouged a little at $20 cash.   After making it inside my wife and I checked in with the host and then proceeded downstairs to the bar.  The downstairs of this restaurant has about 4 or 5 4-tops looking out into the city and then a bar that seats around 6 facing away from the view.  On the day that we were there it was hot downstairs and I would not have been happy if we had to stay down there for a long time.  Thankfully we didn't and the bartender was nice and got me my beer and my wife her wine.  About 15 minutes later another member of our party arrived and we were told we could head to our table.  What a table it was too as it was in its own secluded room on the second floor with a perfect view towards the city and could fit exactly six people.  If that wasn't good enough it also had its own AC unit which means that our dining experience was significantly better temperature wise than the people who were along the windows just outside our room.  

For dinner on this evening Vue 412 had their special dinner menu out.  That meant a few different entree choices but mostly a raise in price in the normal entrees.  They didn't gouge you though and if you take into account our view of the fireworks, I thought it was well worth it.  In any case my wife and I started out by splitting the calamari appetizer which we ordered around 8.  Then when our appetizers came around 8:15 or so I went with the osso bucco for my entree while my wife with the salmon.  The calamari here was decent as the breading was light and the calamari was cooked pretty well.  After we finished that we then sat around for while and then even longer.  It got to the point where all of our table was wondering where our food was.  Thank goodness we had ordered those appetizers or else I would have been starving.  Finally, a good hour and 45 minutes or so later, our entrees made it.  This ended up coinciding perfectly with the grand finale of the fireworks (they started a little later than the advertised 9:30).  I know the restaurant was slammed due to the fireworks but they had to expect that and should have been better prepared.  My osso bucco ended up tasting pretty good.  It was flavorful and fell off the bone quite easily.  The sides that came with it were garlic mashed potatoes as well as carrots and asparagus.  All of the sides were pretty bland although cooked well.  Still, you wouldn't find me ordering them if given the choice at a restaurant.  By the time our waitress made it back to our table it was 10:30 or so and so my wife and I had been here for over 3 hours.  I don't remember our waitress offering us a dessert menu and I am pretty sure that no one would have taken her up on it anyways.  That's a shame too as I think with quicker service that my wife might have ordered their death by chocolate. 

The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't head back here again in the future.  If it's the view you are after with some mediocre food, then by all means head here as our room and view was fantastic.  However the slow service and bland sides left me wanting more from the restaurant even with it being the 4th of July."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here last night with my fiance for a belated birthday dinner for myself.  Whenever we got there the place was packed which I thought was surprising for a Wednesday but thankfully I had made reservations.  We arrived right around the time of our reservation and were told that our table wasn't ready yet but should be soon as the table we would be sitting at had just received the bill.  It was at this point that things got a little weird for me as I normally would hang out around the host/hostess station or a seating area to wait for our table but there wasn't an area to sit and the hostess was pointing us to a corner of the bar.  So we were essentially forced to sit at the corner of the bar whenever we didn't really want to.  The kicker was that we were wet because it was raining outside and of course we were under the vent which was pouring out cold air.  After about 15 minutes of waiting at the bar we were finally seated at a table, unfortunately under another vent.  This would lead to my fiance being cold for the rest of the the night and me not being terribly comfortable either.  Thankfully things would get better after this.  Once we were finally seated I was able to get a better look at the restaurant.  It was pretty modern looking with some track lighting and one big pretty light, a bar in the corner and very clean.  Since the restaurant was very full though and it is a very open space the restaurant was very loud and I actually had a hard time hearing my fiance for the first half of dinner.  There also was a nice looking courtyard out in front of the restaurant that we passed on the way in with a number of tables that could not be used that night due to the rain.

We decided to start off our meals by splitting an appetizer which consisted of fresh fig on top of chorizo on top of a cheese with a rhubarb syrup on the plate.  After the odd opening experience of feeling like a second class diner, I did not want to like the food and at first glance was a little disappointed in the size of the appetizer.  However, it proved to be excellent and although small, 1 fig sliced into quarters, I really enjoyed it.  The sweet fig combined with the slightly spicy chorizo and savory cheese was awesome.  For my dinner entree I decided to go with the wagyu flat iron, medium, which came with some type of aioli on it while my fiance went with the lemon salmon.  All of the entrees were to be served with a vegetable and a starch and both of ours came with identical items that seemed to be cauliflower, bak choy(?) and sweet potatoes.  My steak came out with a good helping of aioli poured over it which I would normally be happy about.  However, this steak could have been the star on its own and I thought that the aioli actually detracted from it.  The steak tasted very good with a nice sear on that gave it a nice crust and was still tender even though it seemed to be more of a medium well than a medium.  My fiance was also very happy with her salmon and thought that it tasted good.  While I am normally not much of a dessert person, the rest of the food was good enough that I decided to give it a try.  I went with the salted caramel cheesecake while my fiance went with some decadent chocolate cake which she loved.  My cheesecake was interesting in that it was served in what I would consider a mini jar and then topped with whipped cream, caramel and the salt.  Due to this I was able to control the topping/cake ratio which was nice and I thought my dessert was very good, especially whenever I got a nice piece of salt with the rest.  My only complaint of it would be that there wasn't enough of the salt but that is minor as I wouldn't want my dessert to be too salty.

The bottom line for me is that I am not sure if I would head back here again in the future.  The food was certainly awesome and by itself would deserve 5 stars but I was not a big fan of the atmosphere of the place and it may be the first restaurant that I have been to where I would use the word snobby to describe it."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife for drinks and dinner.  Rusty Gold Brewing has been on my list of Yelp bookmarks for quite a while and so whenever my wife and I got a free weekend night we decided to pay it a visit.  The restaurant is in the heart of Canonsburg and on the day that we were there it was warm enough that they had the front area open to the elements.  It consists of a large bar that runs along the left side of the restaurant and then seating throughout the rest.  Both their beer and food menus are on chalkboards behind the bar and they have a ledge high up that goes around the restaurant which has older things on it.

For dinner on this evening I decided to go with one of their Lenten specials, the Shrimp po boy, while my wife went with a Pepperoni flat bread.  We also tried to place an order of hush puppies but were told by our bartender that they were sold out.  Whenever our food came to the table I have to admit that I was a bit confused by mine.  My ""po'boy"" consisted of some shrimp, letucce, tomato and onion on a hamburger bun along with a side of fries and some tartar sauce and cocktail sauce.  Where was my crunchy French baguette and more importantly where was the remoulade?  It was disappointing to say the least as I think it should have been called shrimp sandwich instead of po boy as it only resembled a po boy by having fried shrimp on it.  Once I got past my disappointment with it I have to admit that at least the shrimp tasted good as the breading to them had a nice thickness as a cornmeal grittiness which I liked.  The fries here were your average fries and there wasn't anything special or bad about them.  My wife did enjoy her flatbread pizza and while the piece I tried wasn't bad, I can't say I was impressed by it.

Beer wise, as i often do whenever I visit a new brewery, I went with a flight here.  I was given the option to choose 4 or to have all 8 and so of course I went with all 8!  The first beer that I tried was the 1802 Cream Ale which was a Nice and smooth drinker with the flavor of malts coming in on the finish.  My wife really enjoyed this one and it was probably her favorite that she tried.  In any case, up second was the Recessive trait Irish red which almost tasted like a stout or porter with some dark malts early before some smokiness to finish.  Next was the Insanity defined IPA which had smooth start proceeding into some nice citrus and hops to finish.  Fourth was the Widget salesman Irish Stout which was a surprisingly light beer for its color.  It had a little smokiness on the nose and you could really taste those dark roasted malts in the taste.  The fifth beer that I tasted was Terra bullies brown ale which started off with some bitterness before finishing with a somewhat sweet flavor.  Sixth was the Repurposed rye barrel aged barley wine.  I have to be honest and admit that I generally hate barley wines.  This one was no exception as it had that strong barley wine taste but at least I could appreciate the oaky flavor from the rye barrel which made it a lot more palatable in my opinion.  Seventh was the Crows fly at midnight imperial stout which started off with a little sweetness before heading into some bitterness and mellowed out at the finish.  I really couldn't tell that it was 10% ABV which was nice but that could be dangerous.  Last but certainly not least was the Yorkshire peppermint patty.  I didn't even try this one due to the fact that I can't have chocolate.  Before i made that decision I did ask and although there is no milk chocolate in it, it's made with cocoa nibs, vanilla and peppermint which was enough to make me pass.  My wife thought that it tasted good though and was very pepperminty.  Out of the bunch I think that the IPA and cream ales were my favorites.

The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  While there wasn't anything necessarily wrong with the beer of the food here, there are plenty of other breweries in the Pittsburgh area which do both better."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"This review is specifically for the dinner that I enjoyed in the apartment above Merante's Gift Shop.

I have stopped by here twice now for dinner, both times with a group of 8 people.  The first time that we ate here my wife and I were both unsure of where to go.  We hesistantly headed up the stairs next to the shop into the apartment above which thankfully ended up being the correct place!  The apartment consists of a couple of rooms off to the right where you can mingle and eat your appetizers and then the kitchen a bit farther down where we have always had the rest of our meal.

On both of our visits we have started off the evening with 6 different appetizers.  This last time around we had meatballs, a tuscan loaf of bread covered in spices, a cucumber salad, stuffed mushrooms, roasted vegetables and a stuffed tomato.  My favorite of the bunch both times was the tuscan loaf covered in spices.  After you finish up the appetizers you are invited into the kitchen where the rest of the meal is served family style.  First up at the table was our soup which was a minostrone genovese.  Maria, the main cook, suggested that we add some red pepper flakes and some parmesan to it which gave it some extra flavor and the little bit of kick which I loved.  Whenever we were finished with our soups, ricotta gnocchi was served to our table with a red sauce made with pork and beef simmered in red wine and tomatoes.  What is nice about this place is that Maria is very accomodating to food allergies.  Since I am not able to have red wine, they made a special bowl of the gnocchi for me with a san marzano sauce.  It was really good and I loved how light and fluffy the gnocchi ended up being.  Once that course was finished we were presented with a crown roast of pork on one platter and winter vegetables on another.  The crown roast of pork was quite impressive and the 8 of us had a hard time finishing even half of.  The vegetables were also good here and I was sad that I had filled up as much as I did as I was not able to eat as many as I would have liked.  There was also some green beans with tomatoes and olives floating around which is pretty much the only item of the night that I didn't really care for.  While I normally love green beans, they tasted of the olives that they were cooked with and so it wasn't for me.  Of course with all of the other food on the table I didn't even really care and I know its something that I normally would not have ordered at a restaurant.  The salad was served next after the main course.  It consisted of apples, pecans and cranberries over Romaine and was topped with their balsamic glaze dressing.  It was really good and I especially loved the large granules of sea salt (Maldon perhaps?) that were on it which helped to make it taste extra good.  Last but not least was our dessert which was Chocolate LOOOOOOVE Cake.  It consisted of chocolate custard, chocolate cake and chocolate Mousse.  Since chocalate is the other food besides red wine which I am not able to enjoy, Maria was nice enough to make me a cinnamon cannoli for dessert.  While everyone was enjoying their chocolate cake, my dessert was brought to the table and was greeted with an audible sigh from some other members of our party that they were not getting the cannoli also.  As we were finishing our desserts Maria produced a decaf espresso for anyone that wanted it.  It had a nice orange flavor to it and was very good.  When all was said and done, all of the substantial amount of food that our group did not eat was packed up by Maria and set aside for us to take home.  Everyone ended up leaving with a fair amount of it.

The bottom line for me is that we will be back here again in the future.  As a matter of a fact we already have our reservation made with the same group for July.  Beyond that my wife and I are trying to get some family together for another time.  If you are looking at trying to eat here I recommend that you book early because as of early Februrary all of the weekend days through November were already booked.  The only other thing to note about this place is that it is BYOB."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here this past Friday with my fiance, another couple and their toddler.  My fiance and I arrived at the restaurant shortly after 7 PM and walked in to see a mostly empty space.  Shortly thereafter the hostess came over to us and asked us if we had reservations.  Sadly I thought that the place was a little bigger than the maybe 5 or 6 tables that it had in it and we did not.  We were then offered the option of either sitting inside at the bar or outside.  Since we were going to have a toddler with us, we ended up choosing outside even though it was threatening to rain.  Due to us sitting outside I didn't really get to see how the dining room looked.  The bar I did get to see though and whenever you were in there it almost felt like you were in a tourist trap in Mexico.  There was some cheesy 70's overstuffed red chairs and a lot of Mexican tchotchke behind the bar.
 
Soon after we chose to sit outside the other couple made it there and had brought their own bottle of wine since Casa Rasta is BYOB.  Upon coming over to introduce herself the waitress ended up taking the bottle of wine off of the table and disappeared into the restaurant.  I don't think I have ever seen a BYOB bottle of wine disappear into the restaurant before but it ultimately didn't matter as it was returned about 5 minutes later.  At this point the other couple ended up ordering a quesadilla for their toddler and the waitress left us.  A number of minutes later she arrived back with the quesadilla and we were able to order.  The table started out by sharing an order of guacamole and also the fried avocado fries.  For my entree I was having a hard time deciding between the chicken curry and the fish tacos but my mind was made up whenever my fiance ordered the fish tacos and I noticed a little fire symbol next to the curry naming it as very spicy.  The guacamole came out first and ended up tasting rather good.  It had a slight spice at the end that gave it more depth than your normal guacamole and tasted good on what seemed to me to be homemade tortilla chips.  Whenever we had finished with the guacamole the avocado fries came out with a Isleno sauce ( it seemed like a tropical marina?).  Even though the fries didn't have too much flavor to them I ended up enjoying the textural components of as the outside was crunchy while the avocado inside was soft.  Dipping them into the Isleno sauce helped to get them some extra flavor as well although it wasn't the best combination I have ever had.  Next up were our entrees and my Jamaican jerk curry came with coconut rice and pickled onions.  Wow, what a let down it was as my entree was very bland.  I literally could not detect even the tiniest bit of heat in my Jamaican jerk curry.  I guess my idea of Jamaican Jerk and Casa Rasta's is quite different as mine normally involves scotch bonnets or haberneros.  The pickled onions also seemed to lack the bite of being properly pickled which is a shame as I loved pickled vegetables.  Other than being bland my meal ended up being ok as everything was cooked nicely.  The curry sauce on the chicken kept it moist and it went well with the coconut rice.  My fiance was also nice enough to give me one of her fish tacos and after eating that I knew that I had chosen poorly on my entree as the beer battered fish was good.  As our table was coming close to finishing our meals the weather took a turn for the worse and we ended up heading inside to finish off our meals at the bar.  By this time there was only one empty table in the restaurant.  We eventually made it out of there but not before quite a bit of a wait for our checks and then again while paying them.  As a matter of a fact the service the whole night was pretty slow and blasé.  It seemed to take entirely too long to get our meals ordered and the food to come out in addition to the fact that my water glass was empty from before we finished our appetizers to the end of the meal.
 
The bottom line for me is that I might head back to Casa Rasta in the future.  While the service was not very good the food had some potential but I would love to see my dish have some heat especially it is marked as very spicy."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here last night with my fiance for dinner at around 7 PM.  Honestly I had never heard of Fresco's before last night and only stumbled upon it while looking through the 2014 Entertainment book but boy am I glad that I did!  It's location is probably part of its problem as even though I knew where it should have been (a little off of 19 in the Wexford Flats next to the Chadwick), I still had a little bit of a tough time finding it .  Whenever we finally arrived there were a lot of cars in the parking lot with no other businesses nearby so you can imagine my surprise whenever we walked into a completely empty restaurant.  I am not talking just of customers but there was no hostess, waiter or bartender either for the first 2 minutes that we were standing there.  I believe that there was a private party going on behind some closed doors which would have made sense of the cars.  Eventually our soon to be waiter came out and got the hostess for us who sat us in a booth in a warmer section of the restaurant.  The inside of this restaurant is actually pretty nice looking with hardwood floors, cool lighting and some playful decorations. They also had an outdoor seating area which looked like it could be amazing in the summer although it was not nearly as inviting covered in a couple inches of snow.  My fiance let me know that she saw that they have live music sometimes and I imagine that if that is true combined with the outdoor seating then this place would be amazing.

For our dinners we decided to start of the evening by splitting the Garlic Parmesan fries that came with cracked pepper and basil aioli.  Before our fries came out we were given some some bread, a nice rustic loaf, as well as some olive oil dipping sauce that had some spices and sun dried tomatoes in it.  It was all pretty good and I got that first bite taste of olive oil which I often associate with better oils.  Whenever the fries came out I have to admit that I wasn't too excited by the looks of them as they were glistening a bit, almost like they were too greasy.  However the first taste immediately put that thought to rest as the fries were somewhat crispy and when combined with the browned garlic pieces and strings of melted Parmesan, they were awesome.  The aoili for them was also pretty good although it was not what I expected. The basil for it ended up being some bigger bits of basil leaf and while it was nicely mixed it, I would have thought that it would had been better integrated.  After the appetizer I was now eagerly looking forward to my dinner entree which was the braised beef pot roast with white cheddar mac 'n cheese and caramelized brussel sprouts.  It was also supposed to come with a red wine tomato demi but since red wine gives me migraines, I opted out of that.  After hearing my reasoning the waiter asked if I would like some of the Hunter sauce that is normally served with the meatloaf on the side and I quickly agreed to it.  I should probably note here that the waiter was excellent all evening for us.  He was patient with us without being pushy and seemed to be very accommodating.  My dinner ended up being excellent.  The pot roast was super tender as well as being moist which I was impressed with seeing how it came out dry without its usual sauce.  The hunters sauce was also nice and at first taste I thought the front tasted a little like ketchup but then at the end there was a distinct steak sauce flavor.  My brussel sprouts were also really good as they were halved and then caramelized as promised with a nice little flavoring or butter although not too much to overpower the flavor of the sprout.  Finally the Mac N Cheese was good although it may have been my least favorite part of my plate (not that it was bad by any means) which if you know me says a lot about the rest of my food.  My finance had the blackened swordfish for dinner and let me know that it was perfectly cooked.  She also got a small little arugula salad on the plate which I thought was great since it had pickled onions in it.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future, hopefully soon!  It is not often that I love everything that I had for my meal but Fresco's did that for me last night.  Now if I can only wait until its a bit warmer so that I can try out some of their outdoor seating."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here this past Thursday with my fiance and 4 other dining companions for dinner.  Alla Famiglia has been on my list of places to try for quite a long time and I was eagerly anticipating eating a dinner here.  We arrived shortly before our reservation time of 7:30 at about the same time as another couple from our party. We were almost immediately taken back to our table which was on the first floor in a back room.  I honestly didn't notice too much while we were walking back to our table but thought there was not much decoration in the room we were in.  Yes there was a fireplace but nothing else really sticks out besides the fact that the lights would dim a bit for about 5 seconds before eventually brightening back up every 10 minutes or so.

Since none of our party had ever been to Alla Famiglia before our server took the time to go over the menu with us.  Whenever he got to the veal chop and explained it was their specialty, I immediately knew that was what I wanted.  So I ended up ordering that with the pizzaiolo option while my fiance went with the seafood diavolo.  My veal chop was described as a double cut natural chop braised with hot and sweet peppers, homemade Italian sausage, and plum tomatoes while my fiances seafood diavola had many different types of seafood in it including a lobster tail.  All entrees also come with a first course of salad and a second course of pasta with vodka sauce, both served family style.  While we were waiting for our first course to come out they served us some crusty Italian bread along with a couple of different dipping sauces of which I remember one that had a couple of different imported cheeses, one with goat cheese and then another which was olive oil based and called the holy oil(?) due to a trio of herbs of which one was basil.  That one was my favorite and when combined with some of the Parmesan cheese that they had on the table was awesome.  After a short while our salads came out, 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us along with a dish of Gorgonzola so that we could top our salads with it.  The salad ended up tasting decent, I only wish that I had more of it.  The six of us quickly finished it all and then were in for quite a bit of a wait before our pasta with vodka sauce arrived.  It was long enough for all of us to notice and wonder what was taking so long for pasta.  Whenever it arrived, once again 2 family style bowls for the 6 of us, I thought that it tasted pretty good.  It wasn't the best vodka sauce I have ever tasted but since I was still pretty hungry at this point I really enjoyed it especially after adding some of the chili oil that they brought to the table with it.  The chili oil gave the sauce that perfect bite for me.  Almost immediately after finishing our pasta our dinner entrees arrived.  My veal chop looked impressive and was big enough to make comments about how it could tip the car on the Flintstones.  Most of that was due to the size of the bone although there was a decent amount of meat on it.  The veal itself was cooked perfectly as it was moist and juicy and I  ended up enjoying it. The pizzaiolo sauce was just ok though as some of the sausage that I had seemed to be burnt while others were fine.  Whenever I had the non burnt pieces I liked it but the couple of burnt pieces really made the sauce inconsistent from bite to bite.  I was also lucky enough to try some of my wonderful fiances lobster tail and thought that it was very good.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender and tasty while not being overdone at all.  After all that we had eaten our whole table ended up passing on dessert and I left the restaurant full but not overly so.  I am still wondering about all of these reviews that tell you how much food they received which was also said by the valet on the way in.  It made me wonder do they normally serve a family style portion to two people instead of the three like they did at our table?  Should I feel cheated on this one?  Maybe I will find out on a future visit but then again maybe I will not.

The bottom line for me is that I might come back here again in the future but I don't think that this would be my first choice.  Don't get me wrong, the food here was pretty good but whenever my food bill after tip is coming out to about $150, they had better either have impeccable service like the Capital Grille or Ruth Chris' or to die for food.  Sadly Alla Famiglia let me down on both accounts here as the food was good and the service average."
4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,"I stopped by here this past Saturday night with my fiancé and another couple for dinner.  We had made reservations for 7:30 and arrived 5 minutes before then and were happily told that our table was ready for us.  This was a surprise because the place was absolutely packed, we even had a hard time avoiding people to get to our table.  The décor in here is actually pretty cool as the table tops are a copper color and everything screams chic.  While my fiancé and I waited for the other couple in our party to arrive we decided to get some drinks since we had seen people on Yelp rave about them.  I ended up choosing the G&G Club Cocktail which consisted of bourbon, amaro, crème de cassis and orange bitters while my fiancé went with the Mai Thai.  My drink was served in a brandy sniffer type vessel with an orange peel floating in it while my fiancés was served in a tiki like wooden cup that had a face on the front.  I was actually a little disappointed in the amount that was in my glass for $10 but went with it anyways.  It was decent but I had a hard time discerning any bourbon flavor at all from it which is the main reason that I went with the drink in the first place.   I am guessing that the crème de cassis just overpowered everything else.

Whenever the other couple arrived the waitress told us that she would go over the menu with us but didn't really say too much about it other than what was already printed.  She did mention that they also had some dim sum and that it would circulate around.  On one side of the menu is a section entitled salads, sandwiches, noodles, etc. and the other side is entitled for sharing, small and large.  The salads, sandwiches, noodles, etc. section made sense in the fact that you knew you were getting one of those but you had to discern what it was you were getting from the ingredients on it.  Call me old fashioned but it's easier for me if you just tell me.  Then the other side I was confused on how much food we were actually going to get from it.  The prices ranged from $6 to $20 and I am guessing from appetizer sized portions to entrée sized?  In the end I decided to go with the smoked brisket sandwich as well as a crispy tofu dish while my fiancé went with the beef short ribs noodle dish.  The couple across from us went with the sandwich and noodles dish as well and those happened to be the 4 dishes that arrived first.  My smoked brisket arrived on a baguette with kohlrabi kraut, sabayon, pickled red onions, corned beef tongue  and horseradish cream with some thousand dressing on the side.  The sandwich was pretty good albeit a bit messy as I almost had some oil drip off the sandwich and onto my sweater with my first bite.  After that I made sure to keep the sandwich over the plate.  The brisket and beef tongue on it were both tender and tasty and that went well against the crunchy baguette.  I can't really say that I noticed the pickled onions on it although the kraut was decent and then I was not sure that I could tell the sabayon or horseradish on it probably due to the mixing/dripping.  After all 4 of us had finished our first courses the crispy tofu came out and consisted of the tofu with daikon, bok choy, mushrooms and a foam that was supposed to be hot & sour mushroom essence.  I found this dish to be ok but much more exciting in the description.  The tofu was not crispy as described and ended up being more of a soft silken texture than anything else.  At least the vegetables were cooked nicely and while I have had some good foams before, I was a little confused by its use here.  After my fiancé and I finished that our waitress came around and asked us if there was anything else we wanted.  We responded that we still had not seen any of the dim sum and then amongst ourselves commented on how we had been sitting there for 55 minutes without it.  Within 10 minutes of our comment the dim sum guy was once again walking around with some food and would stop by our table twice in the next 20 minutes.  On that first stop I ended up grabbing the pork belly bites while the fiancé went with the squid salad.  I have to admit that I really like the idea of American Dim sum, I only wish it had been available a bit earlier.  The pork belly bites ended up being my favorite part of the meal as the pork belly was cubed and had some orange, chili, garlic and ginger with them.  My fiancé also really enjoyed her squid salad of which I took a bite and loved the kimchi flavoring in it.

The bottom line for me is that I probably will not be back here again in the future.  Am I glad that I came?  I sure am as I think the idea of the place is cool, especially the American dim sum, and love that they are located downtown.  The service was also pretty good in that our water glassed got filled up fairly quickly through most of the evening and our server was around when needed.  However I ended up leaving the restaurant $80 lighter in the pocket and still hungry and unsatisfied."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Another great spot for my Recovery Meal after a day at the Lake training or out in Henderson. I heard few mix reviews about LYFE but as in reading never judge book by its cover or get your own opinion before passing judgement My first impression was love the interior design has positive zen vibe. Then the first thing stands out (the oversize forks inside and outside) you see the fresh herbs display rows not just one and thinking healthy/organic restaurant. The colors very earth tomes all around especially with the one guess artwork green hill vast open landscape. Cool wall. Surprise once you looking at the menus (right not all healthy have gluten free, vegetarian, and regular) not all catered hardcore healthy but universal. I like that option! One thing that found interesting for the better or worst not sure since am caffeine addict. They do not serve soda......Thankfully recovery meal so perfectly good with water. Water is Awesome! Who serves water on TAP and all in nice water station area that think just for servers. They have cold, like warm, and sparkling water all on tap. They have lemons on the side  can add. The fresh lemonade was phenomenal! I tried my friend hibiscus beet lemonade was off the charts, and the ginger pomegranate not so much little tart for me. They also have regular lemonade. I like bold statement that say all things healthy and even step up with beverage not soda fountain or nothing. I wonder if get dirty look if you brings in your own soda. Lol!

It was my first time ordered two dishes. The edamame hummus and vegetables. BY far the best Hummus had in long time. The best thing about it is not made with traditional chix peas but mostly edamame beans. I always been fan of edamame beans. It side dish always look forward on AYCE sushi nights. I never thought about it for Hummus. The consistency was unreal off the charts, the seasonings they put in it brought it all together, and not even started on the vegetables served with it. OMG. Not only do not get cheated on this dish. The amount of vegetables from the broccoli, radish, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, edamame, and pita triangles (long think ones). Not only covered the whole huge round plate. Every single vegetable is SOOO on point! It taste fresh like from farmers market, the radish and cucumbers not fan of raw both crispy and nice snap/bite every one, both the broccoli and radish not same but color bright green nothing brown or old about it, and the pita triangles toasted perfect plus well seasoned on one side. Not vegetarian but this dish will make you ONE. I could ordered two orders be in total vegetarian bliss.

The crispy garden chick'n sandwich. I thought was solid sandwich. Nothing really wow me except the oatmeal bun. That was WoW for me. The side salad that came with the sandwich was fabulous. I like the thought of refreshing salad for lunch with sandwich. It decent little portion and the dressing some kind of vinaigrette was tasty. 

The service was good. You go up to the counter order and then they bring the food out. 

I see myself coming back here more often with more training days out at the Lake or near the Multi Generation Center. I love the diversity of the menu. I look forward the next tasty sample off the menu."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Ube Ube and more Ube. If Ube is something you crave, fan, or looking to try in different forms Cafe 86 is the spot to hit. I have been meaning to try Cafe 86 not only cause of the hype but it literally down the street from my house. Not say Ube crazy fanatic but nothing wrong with getting your Ube kick on. Cafe 86 without doubt took care of that in four different ways. It only barely touching the surface with the menu. I came in the afternoon. I took other yelpers advice because the later you go the more they run out of stuff. Not that unheard of concept in Vegas besides peeps bakery the best time go first thing in the morning! The smell of all that fresh baked goodies. No doubt walked into Cafe 86 had that beautiful smell to kick start ones day. 

I was torn apart where I should start my first Cafe 86 visit? I went little Ube crazy went for two each. I got the Ube cupcakes with flan, cheesecakes, ube bars, and ube macaroons. All the stuff out in the display got covered. heehee. Plus had get ube drink. Forgot the name of it. I got the most popular one the worker told me was the hot seller. I started with macaroon. Talk about HUGE for macaroon. Nothing small of tiny about the ones at Cafe 86. Not that one dunk my macaroons in anything. But put size in perspective need extra size coffee mug dunk it. It was amazing. It was nice soft, fluffy, moist, and right balance of Ube. I went for the bars. It hearty bar. Just to finish one was pretty filling. The cupcake for me stole my ube heart. The combination between the flan and the cupcake. The different textures was out of this world amazing. To take both components separate would die for and could order all day. The cupcake was nice size and the flan on top or custard perfect. It had nice golden brown color, rich, creamy, and combine that with moist perfect cupcake. Cupcake that blows one mind. I never had cupcake like that before. The cheesecake was good. Nothing that really stood out for me. Honestly I had so much Ube and different ones might have killed the taste for me. One thing found consistent in all the goodies I order. The balance of the Ube was spot on, great portion size not fancy high end tiny tease bits of desserts, and you know bit into it the freshness everyday make new batch. 

The interior is pretty cool. It definitely spot that you could hang out chill with friends. Two spilt levels that can hang out. The second level more open area that have oversize jenga blocks, and one more think oversize game. Notice they had couple board games that you play too. I enjoy the way all the pastries are displayed in glass cases. The way they package everything appreciate they have special containers perfect fit for cupcakes and cheesecakes. If want take them home eat looks the same when you left. The menu chalkboard style nothing electronic. The artwork on some of the walls enjoy old school true art. They have couple little interior decors that gives the place personality for me.

The staff is all awesome. Everyone interacted with was friendly, helpful for my first time, and smiles all around. Five star service hands down.

No doubt if ever need Ube fix blessed to have perfect spot right down the road for me. If never had Ube before Cafe 86 is the go to spot."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"I have mix feelings about Gyu-Kaku. Somethings really liked about the place and somethings that in such competitive market of AYCE Korean/Japanese BBQ not work for me. It still one that would go back to but not one that would rave about friends need check out. My cousin wanted to check it out cause heard rave things about it from his friends. It was 45 min wait but that was on par for weekend or Saturday night. We sat at the bar chill over drinks until our table was ready. The bar I was surprise at the drink prices because it was happy hour prices all day on the menu. Nice surprise plus ordered two appetizers to share. The japanese fried chicken and tuna poke. Both pretty good. The fried chicken was basic karage style. It had nice golden crust outside, cooked perfect in the middle, nice moist and hot, and great dish. The poke was interesting it was nice cubes served with chips, diced avocado, and some kind of sauce. Thinking yuzu style cause had citrus acid flavor but overall nice balance of texture and flavor. The bar area not that big but they have nice size widescreen. So it great spot chill over reasonable price drinks, great bar menu food (the appetizers that can order on the regular menu), and watch some sports. 

Once we sat down decided to do the all you can eat. We were thinking about doing dinner for two people. Really look at the different meats and the price really save couple dollars your better off going all you can eat. Just me. We got the second option believe they have three different prices can choose. Like other AYCE spots the higher menu option get few more premium choices. We ended up going with the middle price one. All the proteins was solid. I kind of forgot the one that stood out best for me cause after the four round. Protein overload. LOL!!! One thing about most of the meat proteins they were cut super thin. I found it different cause most other places not that super thin. It great in the sense the meats cooks way faster so get more. I think prefer little more thicker cuts. The grill our server got it cranked to start and dam by far the hottest burner used at  korean BBQ. So combination of heat and thin slices times we were not turning the proteins over fast enough get little crispy. They never really changed our grill pad. We found out. The last thing want put new proteins on grill that all char with black stuff from the last round. We asked our server if they changed the grill constantly. Honest found it odd answer. She telling us that customers were getting little irritated asking so often change it. They went on the assumption that if customer not mention anything just going leave it the whole time. Makes no sense. Now I know but told them our first time for both so figure something they would have mention. My next visit make point to get the grill swapped out more. Service was ok. She started off great then once got going forgot couple things ordered. The whole grill thing kind of lost points for service. She nice person, friendly, and all smiles. Just the little things service could have been better for me. 

Overall say fan. Just knowing that so many other spots that serve the same concept and others better quality meats. Not sure when the next visit for me. Spot that would hit up again with friends."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"So second stop on cuz foodie tour landed us at EDO Gastro Tapas & Wine. I was excited about because only heard amazing things about the place and the pictures looked solid food every pic. The video with the smoked salmon bruschetta. Normally one that am over the whole show presentation in the dining room. It really comes done to the food...period. They lift the top and see all the smoke flowing out of it. It pretty cool scene project thinking back in high school. The table side show lived up to the hype.

Since on second stop never went crazy but just ordered couple dishes. Montadito (smoked salmon bruschetta, truffle cream cheese, honey), Pulpo Viajero (Tamarind Mole, toasted spicy bread crumbs), and Mishima Wagyu Entrana 3,5oz (Japanese Wagyu skirt steak, black trumpet salt ishiyaki sauce). Also ordered two desserts Flan and Nixtamalizated Cherry Tomatoes. So you could say was all over the place but really the beauty of Tapas style. 

The Montadito like mention love the presentation and lived up to the hype in my mind. Just warning they charge you by the piece. Usually might get couple tapas style per order even if small portions. She made sure order tell us. We got three each of us could try one. The smoke really added huge depth right off the back. Not only beautiful smell of smokiness but take that first bite accent the smoked salmon even more. Then the combination of the truffle cream and the perfect toasted bruschetta that crispy bite toasted crusty bread. Addicting and could keep popping those those things in one bite keep going. The Pulp Viajero loved the most the different textures and it all came together. Mole the squids then spicy aioli rolled with breadcrumbs. Lot of flavors going on in one tiny piece of squid. It worked! Each one compliment one another and brilliant idea. The Wagyu was solid quality beef. The black trumpet salt really made it stand out. It not normal everyday salt more high end salt. It showed cause maybe could use dipping sauce but appreciate high end wagyu it brought out the flavor perfect. The desserts were just as amazing as the food. The flan especially the lemon curd made it shine bright. The Nixtamalizated with the compressed watermelon and cherry. It was amazing light refreshing dessert. Every single dish had really stood out for each reasons. The menu had such nice diversity for everyone. They even have chef menu. I think if not multiple spots would do. The chef chooses for you and the price $45 not bad.

I enjoyed the interior on wall have cool painted mural. You have glass wine cellar in the back. I feel spanish flare to it. My cousin asking the server since EDO and told some Japanese influence also in the mix. The presentations on the all the dishes would say towards the fine dining style but really nice. The dishes used not single dish same one. The hot stone cook the wagyu nice touch. It is Tapas so if looking get full not the  place for you or could just going spend bunch of money. lol. It small place so depending on the day might want make reservation. That whole little shopping mall parking going suck. If anything overflow can park across the street then walk over. 

The service was FIVE stars on point the whole time. Waitress was nice, friendly, knew the menu, and made our first experience great one."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Talk about more then Boba! All the recent Boba places opening around town and even been noticing existing restaurants now serving Boba. I just assume Boba Hut was another Boba place getting in on the mix. What I found out was a tiny family run restaurant that serves nice diversity of food, great great value for the price, most dishes under ten dollars, and good local food. 

The diversity of the menu. Half of the menu is local comfort food from 808 like chicken katsu, kalbi, and really most part see at any local Hawaii style restaurant. The other half has nice selection from typical Chinese dishes like Drunken Noodles, Chow Fun, and then asian fusion with the pork belly action done few different ways. Some traditional Taiwanese dishes. So if looking for asian comfort food Boba Hut has you covered pretty good. 

My first visit went with comfort food ordered the Kalua Pork with Cabbage. The Kalua Pork was Ono. It had nice salty taste, cooked perfect, nice portion of cabbage (nice big cuts sometimes see cabbage cut thin blends in with the pork), and had two scoops rice and mac salad. The Mac salad honestly ONLY thing that stopped me from giving it five stars. Mac Salad to be honest was one of the worst ones ever tasted. Mac Salad that huge part of any plate lunch. The thing I was not fan of was the mayo or dressing lacked flavor, seasoning, water down consistency, and not very good. I also ordered the Pork Belly Bun with Cilantro and Pineapple for appetizer. Talk about solid. Steam buns find it to be hit or miss. Usually been miss for me that it not come out hot or moist. Next thing know biting into hard outer crust steam bun, not moist on the inside or hot, and kills the whole dish. Right off the top the steam bun was nice moist, hot, no crust, and could eat dozen buns by itself. You add the grilled pork belly that tell marinade for while and the flavor was awesome. Fill it out with sprig of cilantro and pineapple. It add nice little sweet citrus and cilantro balance out soy based (just guessing the marinade) spot on. No doubt one appetizer will be ordering again.

Second visit want try one of the noodle dishes. I ordered the Drunken Noodle with Beef. I don't normally order Drunken Noodle so have no idea if authentic or not. All I do know it was very hearty. Good. Not just only noodles. Bean sprouts, onions, nice amount of sliced beef (not skimpy of the cuts), and think even eggs in it. One thing watch out if not fan of spicy. They add small thai peppers that sneaks up on you with the heat. Another dish would order again. 

I mention earlier nothing really over ten dollars. The value one dish is all you need and even then might end up with leftovers. Friday and Saturday it open late till midnight. I think is awesome. Most local places I know close at 10 so if looking for late night local food outside California. Great option. They do love yelpers. I had no idea until the cashier told me with your check-in on yelp get 10% off the bill. The s staff is awesome. Both times went cashier is friendly, attentive, and they remember my face second visit. Details. 

It in the same shopping complex as the Dickie barbecue. It tucked around the corner of the building so not as visible off rainbow. 

I love the fact its right down the road for me. I definitely plan on coming back again again."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"BIG Mahalo goes too my cousin Lori I for finding this place on Yelp. She has a gluten and dairy allergy so had few places bookmarked on her list wanted check out while visiting from the 808. Couple others ones but this was not only great find but even better less then ten minutes from my house. No doubt if in the personnel make your own pizza mood The Pizza Kitchen is my go spot hands down. I know your thinking there are SO many more options come to the whole build your own pie. It crazy thinking over the past few years the growth. Not just one side of town plus have all these chains coming from California, etc. Current could say Pieology or Blaze is the biggest names?? I never had Blaze (yet) but have had PIeology. Still fan of Pieology. Really lets be honest not much difference between any of these places but the details and the interior. 

Details Pieology not sure if they have unlimited toppings like The Pizza Kitchen. It can be misleading cause certain topping or say if get gluten free sought up charge of dollar. Certain toppings or extra that if not looking your pie can be over ten dollars. But for the basic The Pizza Kitchen think better deal then Pieology. The toppings for most part have the same options although green zucchini nice big slices at The Pizza Kitchen not recall if Pieology has it. The traditional the dough at The Pizza Kitchen really enjoy. It has nice golden crust everything cooked even and nothing burnt about the pie. They have few speciality pizza if not in mood come up with one. I did try the white clam pizza. Ok. My only problem was feel like could have put more clams on it. Outside of that the white sauce was really nice and perfect compliment with the clams and other stuff on top. My own my first visit keep it simple went with traditional, house blend cheese, pepperoni, sausage, artichoke, and pinch of jalapeño. Awesome. The second visit wanted try the pesto sauce so went with chicken and artichoke style pie with the pesto sauce. The pesto sauce is solid. I could have that sauce with basic pasta dish and be in pesto bliss. All the pies cook really fast so not much of wait. Nice and hot. The possibilities are endless. The dough have traditional, whole wheat, or gluten free. The base sauce, cheeses, protein, and toppings so many options it was hard make up one mind. So am sure they have some option for everyone and the only limit is ones imagination. Pieology they have whole Gelato section although both visit had no room after my pizza. Next time.

The service is five stars. The first trip mini Ohana reunion with bunch of cousins hardly see plus my own family my brother and his family. We were all first timers they were really patience explained the whole concept and nothing but smiles. Friendly. Once pie done they bring it out and again same positive vibes. 

The only thing that negative is location could be better around it. I have been living in the same area for years. I had no idea. The front of it looks nothing like the interior one that they did really nice good. Few different artwork all around the restaurant. Great place chill with family or whoever have great pie relax and talk stories. If looking for quick tasty pizza..The Pizza Kitchen is winnah. Literally went back two days later cause wanted try more and the best part is you never really have same pizza back-back."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Only reviewing the concert venue part of Brooklyn Bowl but ASSURE you will be back too not only do some bowling but check out some of the food. I came Brooklyn Bowl check out Elvis Costello and The Roots since won tickets on yelp. Shout out too Drew A. He is always working hard coming up with great events and hooking yelpers with all kine tickets. I do like both bands just so you all know but truth just as excited too check out Brooklyn Bowl. I had no idea the concert venue going too be set up. Me not exactly concert guy but been too few different locations for concert in Vegas and nothing like the venue at Brooklyn Bowl. Really not just Vegas but could not think of another venue with the whole vibe with everything else going on around and just the walk too Brooklyn Bowl down the Linq really unique. 

Lets start with walking down cobblestone street too Brooklyn Bowl one that marquee not miss with bright colors and really stand out. Along the way bunch of other restaurants, shops, and few more things not yet open but excited about. Once you get in take escalator upstairs since nothing on ground level. As you get up kind of excitement of unknown the first time all you see is the Brooklyn Bowl sign. Soon you walk in go music playing that most part current stuff and high energy music. The views you see from Brooklyn Bowl from the bar close too the front has great view of The Linq also the restaurant (really not much of restaurant terms of size, not one of the main focus more on the bowling alley and the concert venue; but admit too credit or have no idea no short cuts comes too the food) and best part concert venue patio area open air that chill outside people watch or enjoy the weather. If really bored can look into these observation binoculars see on top of the empire state building. Though not sure you be looking at but like the decor not only with the binoculars but potted plants and lounge vibe. 

The concert venue. Five star more like Six stars in Sugi world. I much more enjoy small venue than big ass venues because get too appreciate the music and the artist on another level. Also not so small that feel trapped in box bump into people or people blocking your view and might get irritated. Brooklyn Bowl had that balance. Yay the stage not that big but still stage that do lot especially with the lighting. The sound system is awesome! I was kicking in back with my friend. You could hear Elvis and The Roots clearly. Even off the dance area in the back can see the performer clearly or if need close up televisions all around (yes even if bowling like free concert literally behind you) plus behind the bar never miss beat. The bars think five star set up!!! Why??? Most places have one or two bar set up not design with the flow or traffic pattern once the concert starts up. One off the side next too the stage and two more in the back area. So not like trample over people too get beer or drink. The space around the dance area and god love the open space feeling from two levels (second level vip). Sunday so maybe concert on friday/saturday might not be as spacious but still LOVE the set up. Great vibe!

Brooklyn Beer is Awesome!! I had all three Lager, Brown, Pilsner. Highly recommend if love craft beers definitely another reason too come Brooklyn Bowl. Assure you be back for the bowling, food, and more craft beer!!!"
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"So my cousin keeps raving about this spot since I took him to another spot very similar concept Forte. It just happened that the other night stars align got together for dinner. Forte for me best of the best comes to Bulgarian or Eastern European food. I came in with open mind not compare both places but obviously similarity in the food and other things very different. Overall say both solid choice if need for legit Bulgarian food.

The first impression with the ambience and decor interesting. They have the restaurant broken down in two sections on one side there the bar and another side just straight restaurant dining. The whole point of that is restaurant part is non smoking so guess wanted keep it true. You can see the other side since part of it glass walls. I never walked around the bar area but modern, like the way look from the outside, and bar tables area that can order food. In the bar area lots of wide screens usually have games on. They definitely stick with european theme has english premier soccer league games on. Also on the restaurant side they have wide screens. The artwork feels Bulgarian all along the walls. 

It was my first time but like mention earlier cousin is HUGE HUGE fan. So for the most part just followed his lead came to ordering. He recommended trying the stuffed peppers, mixed grill, and the biscuit cake. I started with the chicken soup just cause Forte has the best chicken soup and as much as keep open mind. I saw chicken soup just had to get it. It was good. Talk about huge bowl. It was definitely hearty soup with lots of chicken, potato, and couple more ingredients. Flavor wise good but lacked deep and no WOW like Forte. Forte just fyi half the size bowl. But call it a cliche sometimes bigger not always better. The stuffed peppers was tasty nice feta cheese filling and solid. It deep fried with batter. Again similar but different stuffed peppers at Forte same concept just not batter and deep fried. The mixed grill that was the big comparison. The meats were really good. Three different ones plus pork chop. The names not remember but totally traditional style one sausage link style, another more hand form patty style, lamb skewer, and the pork chop. It was served with massive amount of yogurt /cucumber sauce. The link and patty were both really good. Either spot could just be carnivore all night long. The subtle differences keep going back to between the two spots. The mixed grill at Forte get three different meats only but like the fact the sides get three different awesome sides. Again you get more food for your mixed grill but is bigger always better?? The biscuit cake was interesting. Nothing think traditional biscuit about the dish. Truth it was delicious. It heavy dessert so make sure leave room cause its one of the popular dishes on the menu. One that if going for dessert end night at BG Bistro would highly recommend. The 3 egg omelette exactly that basic but added ham. It was loaded with feta cheese mix. It was actually filling but overall probably not the best item show Bulgarian cuisine. My bet. 

The service was fabulous! One thing interesting they have button that can call the server (they have watches that buzz them). Friendly, attentive, and awesome.

All the prices are very reasonable most items under ten dollars. The grill items or little more. You get lot of food for your money."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Mini Yelp gathering with some of my favorite yelpers in Vegas. Most of us was the first time dining at Public School 702. Including me never been but for the most part only heard great reviews! It one of many restaurant in Downtown Summerlin. Off topic say love love the fact Downtown Summerlin finally filling out all of the retail and restaurant spaces. I still remember first open walking around like is anything open. 

Back task at hand. So we had big party so got to see decent amount of food off the menu. No reason but good one for us. The kitchen cooked up extra appetizers so found home at our table. I got try the devil eggs, and bacon cheddar tots. Not sure if extra or someone on the table ordered it but Crispy Buffalo Cauliflower. The presentation not only for all ""For The Table"" or appetizers thought was well done. I like the incorporation of cutting boards. To the little cast iron servers for both the Tots and Cauliflower. I think both of them use the same breading cause looking the same. It nice golden brown outside, hot on inside, and fried goodness. The tots admit enjoyed the best out of the three. I enjoy the combination of bites of bacon and the cheddar all combine in one bite. The other two never ok but nothing special. The eggs really liked the presentation the most out of the three. 

My entree went with the Fried JIdori Chickem & Green Chili Cornbread Waffles. It been while since had Fried Chicken and Waffles. The last time was down south in Atlanta, GA. it was pretty darn good. Public School 702 took Fried Chicken and Waffles another level. The fried chicken not your normal wing and thigh pieces. I enjoy mixed it up then traditional. They incorporated chicken tender meat with the breast. Still have the wing/drumstick. One of the things that stood out for me once got the dish. The hot sauce had on top of the chicken but not completely soaked in it. The batter they use fan of BIG TIME. I love the crispy crust. It has ton of flavor and the meat inside on all the pieces was cooked perfection. The waffles adding green chili not just plain waffles. Yay! f could would order each one separate just double the amount. When put both together then throw some of the bacon sauce or whatever in side dish. Unreal delicious. Memorable. Hearty. No doubt heart attack. Once in while want indulge heavy not good for your health dish. This is the way to go. 

I wanted to try the sirachi ketchup/ mustard sauce with the brown bag of fries. The fries are just that fries. The sauces are devine. The honey mustard sauce that could use for spread on ANY sandwich. The sirachi one of my stable condiments and fan of. It was tasty. If want take fries another level make sure use both the sauces. 

Everyone else dishes on the table looking good. I got try the Truffle Mac and Cheese. I like it!!!! It had nice balance between the truffle and cheese. It came with the steak dish I believe. I know your can order for side. 

The staff is awesome. Our server she was amaZing. There was nine of us she on top of it. Explained everything for the first timers like myself. Made great suggestions on the menu. Friendly. I know lot of times big parties restaurant reluctant split checks. She said not problem at all. Think two or three appetizers lucked out got for free. Thank you Public School 702. I will be attending class again sooner then later............Good stuff!!!!"
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"I can honestly say never been to Louisiana but since the day went too the original Lola  on Charleston. I feel like jumped on plane right on to bourbon street. Just soaking all the finest things the Big Easy has too offer especially the FOOD! Lola she all about keeping too her creole background and sticking with traditional fare but doing it right way from family secrets passed on from one generation to the next. The original location I have been couple times always end up going with one of the Po-Boys. Too DIE for and the most legit ones find in Vegas hands down!! So hearing that they opened second location one much closer on my side of town. Excited! 

Second location sometimes have my doubts. I always think about ""is bigger always better"". You start to lose focus on the things that made you popular in the first place and consistency of the food more locations add. Lola not only small restaurant but great story (one that featured on triple DDD). I love seeing small business owners successful. Right off the top from the moment walked in the vibe, and everything about the interior design screams at you Big Easy. It has the old school colonial look all around, they have area that assume all clams or oysters on ice shuck fresh too order, the bar area think really nice with the brick back splash look to the many widescreen televisions around it, different chairs around the bar area from bar stools to chairs, piano in the bar area (I went for lunch no one playing but assume they do have live music), and NO doubt part of Lola personal taste not miss. She big Saints fan. Dah! You have big Drew Bree artwork. There this shelf near the bar but it feels more like bookshelf at home. Here you have the little things from the mardi gras masks, beads, jars of candy, and all these little almost personnel items. Just the patio area kind of small but had so much personality. They have big oak barrels around, plants, and not just tables outside in open space. Heck you even looking out through window out on the patio area. Just the theme throughout the restaurant got lot of personality but everything that great about the Big Easy. 

The food was awesome!!!! Like I said had my doubts. The Po-Boy went with the Roast Beef. The last time had the soft shell crab. I wanted to knock another one off the list. The bread with any sandwich make or break point for me. Po-Boy had so many imitations that once have the real thing never take step back. Lola is the only place get my Po-Boy on not place comes remotely close. Not just one thing but the BREAD really stands out for me. She gets it shipped in just for the sandwich. It not only the perfect compliment but could get bread all day long. The Roast Beef talk about lot of food. Messy. But nothing better then having the drippings from the beef, sauce, and some hot sauce icing on the cake. It finger licking good. I started with cup of gumbo. Perfect starter! Loved the fact both restaurant felt like the food was consistent. All the things that loved about the first one still are at the original and now the second location. Lola never meet owner that friendly, upbeat, and this passion for food not only saw on the show but in real life. She just happen be sitting at the bar area when I had lunch. It refreshing see owner go around check up on customers and asked my thoughts on my Po-Boy. No doubt plan on coming back again again.."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"So heard about Pasta Pirate in the California Hotel change over to California Noodle House. I have never been to Pasta Pirate so have no idea what the old place looked like just the new look. I was kind of excited about the change only cause California Hotel nothing changes about that place forEver! Locals from the 808 need their local grinds/comfort food. At first glance it really strands out cause SOOO much more since your able to see the inside with all the glass outside. So finding California Noodle House not going be problem on the first floor. I had friends visiting from the 808 and love food as much as me. So between the three of us talk about ordering the whole menu. Thankfully we were all hungry. 

The appetizers really did just about order the whole menu. The chicken lettuce wraps, Cha Gio Chopsticks, and the special appetizer they had on the side (the chef came out making sure our waiter explained to us right way to eat it; he thinks they going put it on the menu menu) sorry forget the name but something along Bao ""Wow"" or steamed bun with think slices of pork on heated skillet served fajita style. They start you off with crispy won ton/fish chips (the colorful ones see served with peking duck as side dish) and comes with dipping sauce. I must admit they are addicting so make sure hold back before you order. 

The appetizers the Chopsticks was my least favorite of the three. The presentation was nice with the arugula salad with citrus vinaigrette. The chopsticks itself nothing special about the filling. All it was thin rolled out plain egg roll. The dipping sauce was blah. The chicken lettuce wraps that was SOLID. We destroyed that and easy could have had second filling. I enjoy the presentation everything was separate. The lettuce was nice crispy, no bruises, or fresh greens. The ground chicken had great flavor and combine with the dipping sauce awesome. The special appetizer was another winnah. Steam buns that always for my experience such hit or miss. They can get hard on the outside if not brought straight out to the table. The last thing I want is bite into steam bun with outside all hard. I like the different concept with the meat served on hot skillet and putting the amount you want on each one. It does have nice kick. The dipping sauce the same talk about sneaking up on you. Combine everything together the backside the after burn is hot. The chef telling us you suppose dip the whole thing once put the meat inside like au jus style. I did but like more conservative approach cause the sauce has kick. 

Our entree two of got the same bibimbap. Outside of the HUGE ass portion nothing great about it. I mean HUGE mean the bowl is eye opener see it. Once you dig in realize over half the bowl is rice. Carb loading is one thing pre race day. Still want vegetables and protein. The tradition bibimbap I know the ratio not whacked like this one. Hardly any pork in it and little vegetables. If want lots of rice this is the one but overall last thing would order. The garlic noodles. WINNAH. I loved the sauce had nice strong garlic flavor but not at all over powering. It had nice portion of shrimp and noodles. If had do over garlic noodles!!! My other friend had the chicken. I thought was ok. He generous enough offer me piece try. 

The service was excellent. Our waiter great time talking stories with and had that aloha vibe. They were on it the whole time."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Old School Brewing Company for my experience was craft solid! I notice going over the reviews that talk about mixed opinions across the board. One trend that notice was the ones that had less then three star experience all came during its soft or grand opening. I have always learned being in the food service industry not really the best time to review any restaurant. Too be fair even in training there still nothing that can stimulate the little things of live service and apparently from past reviews they had few issues. I went with my roommate Roy E (just so happened the last time he came here was during that chaos or mess) after Elite event. I was excited! National Beer Day deserve good craft beer and always wanted too check this place out since close to the house. Roy was telling me about the special seasonal red ale beer he had that was awesome. We went with pitcher of the red ale. Not sure if they do it every National Beer Day but that night was two for one pitchers.

I got the Dancin with the Devil Sandwich. It was solid. It was sirloin steak cut in slices (steak was cook on point nice medium rare to medium), the red pepper aioli really liked plus worked well with the steak, and the peppers/onions. The bread was pretty good. Overall nice hearty sandwich. Warning kind of messy just cause lot of stuff going on inside but all in a good way. The chips would highly recommend over any other side choice. It really looks nothing WoW but when you bite into them. Not bag chips in the bulk or small bag of chips. It sliced thin rigid cut potatoes deep fried just like french fries. Hot, crispy, and addicting. Roy ordered meatball appetizer. Generous enough got to try one. Honest had better. Just ok for me. 

The service something that seems everyones had more bad then good. We got here late. Not lot of people in the bar. The bartender was on it. He was friendly, great talking stories with the whole night, couple other regulars in the bar next thing know talking stories with them, and feel this great laid back vibe in the bar. The bar area really not all that big. The bar basically just rectangle with high bar tables all around. Multiple televisions all around so if want check sports great spot. Talk about dark. The bar area not sure if not well light for reason or when you go into the dining room literally night and day. I never seen brewery that restaurant and bar area is so polar opposite. The restaurant lot lot more spacious, higher ceiling, all booths around and middle area (all the board gamers come out each week) open space all tables and chairs. and so bright almost had get eyes readjusted checking out the dining area. The decor is odd. I come too a brewery drink first, food second, and board games not so much. Board nights apparently big deal bartender was mentioning to us. All that goes on in the dining area. If you board addict you can bring your own games or they have some house games that can use. 

When you walk into the bar they have list of micro brews plus the seasonal beers. It on chalkboard. So if craft beers your taste definitely need check Old School Brewing Company out.  I only had the red ale. If any of the other beers are like it got nothing but praise for the beer. Craft beers always been fan! Micro breweries. Thankfully compare to twenty years ago now in Vegas we have lot more options. This is one plan on coming back and trying more of the craft beers."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Talk about lighting a fire in your stomach or if spicy is not your thing Chengdu Taste might not be the best idea. I love all foods. Chengdu Taste is one spot that might say it lot but one that truly been looking forward too. All the hype about the restaurant in CA and then friends that have gone nothing but rave reviews. The whole Szechuan style is one not that familiar with but one that can appreciate and became huge fan. Not often give five stars but really worthy of all the hype and the food is flat out amazing!!! 

Thankfully had my old roommate in town visiting so got to try a few dishes on my first visit. The menu is HUGE. It more like novel with pages and pages plus lots of pictures. Really most part almost every item has picture or least each section or cooking technique has a picture of one item.  The one pic seen on social network lot or one that got my attention was the toothpick lamb. Not sure about Szechuan style but dam that toothpick lamb looks amazing. It was so LEGIT. It really was so addicting that when get that one little bit of money. You just want more and more and more. It this little sliver of lamb on toothpick (lot of toothpicks) has the most incredible deep of flavor and every piece cooked to perfection. Lamb pick the heat might not hit your right off the back but once get the ball rolling pop three or four in row. You feel the burn!!! The same feeling with the Tan Tan Noodles. Thankfully our server caught us doing it injustice. It was both of our first time. We just taking the noodles before actually giving it good mix working the sauce on the bottom throughout the whole dish. So FYI if get the noodles make sure mix it around before dig in. Tan Tan Noodles really only noodles with the sauce. Simplicity. Nothing jazzed but just great noodles and sauce. So So So good! The third dish we order was Spicy Boiled Fish. I wanted to try something in hot pot. That section alone has a really nice diversity. Different proteins to vegetarian style. The Spicy Boiled Fish was again another amazing dish. The white fish was cooked to perfection nice and moist, hearty not only fish in the pot vegetables from cabbage other stuff, and really next visit if just me Hot Pot is more then enough food for one. Just when you think put dent into it there more! We were going order fourth dish. Thankful our waitress was going over our order and made recommendation that maybe skip the last one if need the order it. Three items for two guys was spot on the right amount of food. 

The service was awesome. The place was busy that night we had short wait before got seated. They were still on it. I did appreciate the fact our waitress thought we order to much food. 

The restaurant definitely got vibe all its own. My first impression was it more like office building then restaurant restaurant. It just one open area with tables and chairs. Not very big place so if place get packed expect wait. Talk about hole in the wall location. Yes it around Chinatown but so off the side road you can easily pass it. The street address hell of confusing because the road is more like pulling in parking lot of building that the restaurant located in. Once pull into the parking lot still little way but just look for the sign outside the building. It definitely falls in the hidden gems for me. I am just happy that finally got me some Chengdu Taste. No doubt plan on getting my heat on again. So much more good stuff on the menu one visit not enough."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Talk about HOT new business. Yelp could not be more on point!!! The passion Chef Tony has for his food amazing. Not only does it show in his food but hearing him describe the menu (it was first time for both Suzy H and I), and later talking about food the kim chi vinaigrette (the thought process about making small batches keeping everyday fresh) first time I seen vinaigrette with that kind korean twist. The vibe the guy exuberates passion for his food, such small business (literally ten chairs in the whole place) he literally takes your order then makes your food, friendly, easy going next thing know talking stories about running/jogging, and cares about his customers. The menu for all its simplicity cause five different bowls and few sides. I love it! Cliche. Quality over quantity. The same thing could be said for menu in restaurants. On this late lunch between two of us just about ordered the whole menu. Not that hard too do. 

We ordered ""Korean Beef Short Rib"", ""Mochiko Chicken"", and ""Kentucky Fried Fish"". The sides ordered the ""Pickled Veg"", and ""Pho-King Egg"". I start with the Star of the show also the most popular bowl out of the five Mochiko Chicken. Hands down. The BEST Mochiko Chicken ever had in Vegas. I had it few times mostly in Hawaiian theme restaurant but the one at The Rice Shop. The things stands out is the breading is amazing. It not heavy batter on light side more tempura batter light. Nice crispy. The chicken is nice pieces and perfectly cooked and moist. The sauce perfect compliment especially get some on the rice. Onolicous. The Kumg Pao Broccoli. If ever went vegan give me bowl of that Broccoli be good too go. The portion size is great and even better is only $9. Steal of deal. It redefine chicken bowl non of this mass market teriyaki bowl that so had been food. Mochiko Chicken Bowl that should be the standard for chicken bowls. 

The Korean Beef Short Rib not your kalbi style but marinates the beef same style and truth Kalbi just without the bone. The beef was nice tender and juicy. Mention earlier the kimchi vinaigrette with the bok chou/cucumber salad. Refreshing with kick. Not at all over the top spicy way. Perfect light side salad compliment the short rib and the rice. 

The Kentucky Fried Fish. Again the batter was delicious. Fried Fish all about only good as the batter. This one nice light not heavy and get nice chunk of fish not small scrapes. The fish cooked perfect. The aioli sauce on top is awesome. Just like the previous two bowls on point but yet each one completely different with different textures and tastes. It puts the gourmet in rice bowl. Still your simple brown paper bowl all the bowls served in. Another love it. Nothing simple about the flavors going on in every bowl.

The sides the Pho King Egg was different. Soft poached egg. The best part crack the yolk get creamy yellow river comes out combine it was the chicharrones. Amazing. You can use it as dipping sauce with your bowls. We just had it by itself. The pickled Vegs assortment of cauliflower, carrots, cucumbers, and one more forget. All very tasty. 

Really everything had was five star awesome. The service if busy might have wait cause not much of staff just Chef Tony. We went for late lunch so perfect time. NO doubt plan on coming back for more. 

It hidden little bit. Main thing is literally right across Dessert Breeze Park next to Other Mama. I think that awesome see two small business restaurants next one another. Both really good."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"In general not very BIG on the whole lobster roll. But talk about five star winnah! It definitely redefined my perception of lobster roll. The few times had it always overcooked, bread not very good, lack of lobster in it, overkill on the mayo or lack of seasonings, and for the price not the first thing that would peak my interest on any menu. Thankfully help of Vegas Yelpers and Suzy H heard about the new Lobster Roll player in town. One that came with lot of great vibes, solid reviews, and established restaurant on the east coast. Luke Lobster based in Maine am like really there nothing more legit then Maine lobsters right??? I kind of had high expectations but in all honesty totally nailed it. 

Thankfully with Suzy H we make sure if going check out restaurant for the first time never get the same thing plus try as much of the menu as our tummy can. lol! We both got the combo that comes with choice of soup, chips, and beverage of your choice. I think its the best deal you can get. Really not sure the exact amount saved. If your going spend the money on lobster roll that not exactly cheap lunch or dinner. Why not get full meal plus the SOUP it must with any of the rolls. Perfect compliment. We ordered the clam chowder and lobster bisque. Both awesome. If there was soup nazi in Vegas. Luke Lobster hands down would go out of my way just for SOUP. Really that good for me. The clam chowder has so much depth not just creamy but hearty with clams, potatoes, and great flavor. The lobster bisque talk about nice chunks of lobster in it. Suzy first bite got nice piece and really till the very bottom find pieces in it. Tradition way more so in fancy upscale restaurants all soup or very little if any actually lobster. Again the bisque has nice depth not just creamy tomato soup but taste the lobster in it and see it. Any soup comes with crackers cause soup without crackers. The chips they have regular and salt & vinegar. The drinks that another reason get the combo. Am sure might see it in speciality stores but it was the first time had that brand that based in Maine. We tried the blueberry soda and the ginger ale. The blueberry soda was delicious. Refreshing. The ginger ale would pass on it. The blueberry soda not overpowering the blueberry flavor but still has the carbonation associate with soda. It was different but the tasty way!!!!

The star of the show the lobster roll. The bread talk about amazing!!!!!!!!!! Always preached on any review with sandwich. Sandwich really starts with the bread and not filling that will offset the bread. The bread or roll they use could eat everyday. They butter it then toast it perfect golden brown on the outside. So good. The lobster was all the things that done the right way. It had nice pieces from the claw, knuckle, and tail. Every piece was cooked to perfection. Moist, without the mayo/seasonings (no idea it is except dam tasty) amazing taste like butter, and all together perfect lobster roll. We even tried the crab roll. Another good one. It was little different because the crab is chilled so not warm like the lobster the meat. Still use the same bread. If you decide split it kind of cute cause bread just of split rolls.

The only thing that bummer. It really small place more like food stand outside of fashion show mall on the strip. Only ten seats. Really look at the positive is there better place too people watch then the Vegas strip?? Now you can do it with style and killer lobster roll. On cold nights the soups will keep you warm. No doubt if not been to Luke Lobster. Need too!!"
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"The time has come to retire my old dead running shoes and get new ones. The store that bought my last two pairs closed. I heard about this store from my triathlon family talked about running assessment, Tom owner great guy, and hell was close to my house. Am in. 

It just so happened had a friend visiting from 808. She was looking to a get new pair of running shoes also. It worked out great cause she ended up getting the running assessment. There is one catch if you do get it. Basically need to be committed getting pair cause if not cost you $20. We both had every intention of getting pair just in my case decided pass. I found it interesting the whole process watching my friend do it. She ran on the treadmill just with socks (I found weird if breaking down someone foot strike pattern would want shoes on). They have camera that sits right behind and films your feet strikes or way both feet land. The sales lady (god bless her forget her name) she was breaking it down telling my friend her running style like gazelle. Whether your landing more on your heels or toe. They break it down to science not only the way your feet strike but the bigger picture your running style effects overall health. Running takes toll on ones body. Last thing anyone should do bad form next thing know had chronic back problems or what not. If know getting pair would recommend taking the time get one. They do take appointments for it. We went basically the store first opened took chance and we were the only ones in the store. It worked out great. Believe my friend got Asic or New Balance. She enjoys that since been out running on them couple times.

Myself I never knew until last year starting my triathlon addiction that having proper running shoes makes HUGE difference. I started with pair of Brooks. Actually just so happen my second pair got the same ones. If not broke why change it?? Really do love the fit and feel of Brooks running shoes. I have a feeling for the style one again my mind set was another pair of Brooks. She looked at my old pairs got the size. I did keep open mind about other brands. She started out bringing out shoes to try each one little different style then the next. Even for my friend we each tried on four or five different pair of shoes. We walked around the store and even better feel ran outside in the front up and down. The Brooks love the feeling, support under my feet, like the look, and ended up settling on my third pair of Brooks Ravenna. =))

Service was no doubt FIVE star one. The moment my friend and I walked in customer service could not have been more on point. She explained clearly the deal with the treadmill assessment. Like mention earlier you can tell she done few assessments. Not only with terminology but she knows what she talking about. The whole time trying on different pairs asking questions about the little comfort issues. Friendly. Easy make conversations with making the process easier and fun. She was bouncing between the two of us. Tom came in later he doing my friend finish instead of her jumping between both of us. She was telling Tom breakdown on her assessment. Tom talk about passion as owner. Great guy. Talking stories with him is blast, makes you laugh, also you can tell got wealth of knowledge with shoes (my friend use to Nike and he was telling her why not fan or really carries Nike), and cares about his customers. No pressure on buying pair of shoes or getting higher end shoe. Tom and his crew really do everything make sure you get the right one!

No doubt found my new running shoe store."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"I keep meaning too get my wings on every time I stopped in Campus Commons but tough call between Kaba Curry and Wing King. I decided too get best of both worlds same night. I had the garlic parmesan fries again. It still so good just like the last time. All the fries are fresh cut none of this pre cut frozen potato fries out of bag. The seasoning on garlic fries just the right amount of garlic and parmesan. If your breath not smell like garlic then you know not garlic fries. Right!?! Still there more depth then just the garlic add the parmesan and right seasonings! Beautiful thing!  Seasonings, flavors, depth, and balance is something say about ALL 40 flavors of wings choose from too four of five different style fries too choose off the menu. Brain makes all the sauces fresh and always tossing new ideas and willing too take risks. That night he came up with new flavor for his wings. Asian orange called it not even on the menu. If you have any doubts or questions with the sauces they will let you sample anyone of the 40 flavors. I appreciate lot shows much he cares about every single sauce he puts his heart and soul in. 

The wings I was going too iceacholics christmas party so got 50 wings too go. It not party platters they start at 100 wings but get fries and another things with party platter. They even go higher then 100 wings but 50 wings was just the right amount. I was having trouble deciding flavors too choose from since you can go 1-5 different flavors went order party amount of wings. Brain was super helpful. We talked about balance of mild too hot style sauces. End came up with four new one asian orange, sweet barbeque, jamacian jerk, and habanero honey. The Habanero honey and jamacian jerk stood out! Both nice kick too them but so much more depth then just heat. I always have problem with any wings/tenders ask for Hot. In essence all tobasco pr durkee red hot or any vinegar base horrible. All the sauces even the mild ones at wing kings the depth of flavors AWESOME! Not just heat with both Habanero Honey or Jamacian Jerk. The Habanero taste the sweetness of the honey counters the balance of the heat from the habanero then add other seasonings brings it full circle. Same things say for the jamacian jerk. I hardly even made dent in 40 flavors but without doubt will make it back enough times too get all 40 flavors in! The chicken can get traditional or boneless. Wings only way too go traditional way not licking fingers clean or getting little messy. The wings are nice crispy on the outside, cooked moist inside, and nice hot. They do amazing job comes too packing them too go. He separates all four different flavors in tin foil, all arrange mild too hot in same pan, and perfect size tight lid keep warm till party starts. He labels the top just in case not forget. It comes with nice amount of celery sticks and nice side of ranch. 

The desserts! Talk about really secret gem in Vegas! It last place you think bake their own fresh DAILY desserts. It presented old school fashion in cake stands with covers too pie pan with cover for his peach cobbler. I had the red velvet cake and this occasion tried slice of banana bread. Both tasty and just wished had more room for dessert. They do sell whole cakes just need give them day advance. Sure if looking too brings whole cake potluck style or party not go wrong.

Service top notch from Brain being helpful with my choices of flavors, gave me complimentary slice of banana bread,  so friendly, and feel small time business that cares about little detail. I find it SO refreshing. Wing King place that plan on stopping by again again."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Heard about another local food spot just opened in Vegas. Always always stay down when comes to local food not only because from 808 but best comfort food ever two scoops rice, mac salad, and entree. I must admit had my reservations cause over the past twenty years living in Vegas (or locals know call Vegas the ninth island) almost over saturated with local spots. The ones that truly stand out for me is individual family own restaurant nothing to do with chains (not that hater still good). Not only does Fist of Fusion Island Grill stand out writing it or saying it out loud. It truly embodies Ohana. I never had conversation with Ronnie or Lisa but reading other reviews. Chef Ronnie was making the rounds asked me how was everything I had for lunch. A new business when see the owner takes time out to come out get feedback from every guest. Not only does it show his passion for his food, also like past review shows that each customer is not customer but part of the Ohana, and felt like living back in the 808.

So first impression was talk about feeling the Aloha spirit! Not only on the wall with coolest sign that the world needs more of. The staff shouting out Mahalos and welcome. They were consistent with every one that came in the hour chilling having my lunch. It small restaurant but has lot of personality in it. The art work on the wall soon walk in. It pretty much covers that whole wall. It looks very much original. It vibrant colors that screams at you. Hula girl with ukulele. Just chilling on the beach. The shaka sign from the logo to the open and close sign on the door. The sit down counter area. It screams personality but very much 808. Above they have three wide screens. The music!!!! So awesome!!! It totally local style Hawaiian music.

The food the menu has nice diversity to it. It not huge menu. It broken down to bowls, burritos, tacos, salads, apps, and ono grindz. It was my first visit not sure where to start. I know the Crispy Torino Span Musubi. One of the reasons came. I have been in this non spam musubi style kick. I seen the katsu style spam musubi but never had one. Talk about WINNAH. I know seen others that the whole musubi is deep fried. Never had so no going compare. I feel Crispy Torino Spam Musubi. If going katsu style this does Spam Musubi right. Only the Spam that breaded katsu style with the panko action. The rest of it is normal spam musubi. The part that separates Crispy Torino Spam Musubi from nothing had before is the tocino sauce. It perfect compliment to the crispy breading with what tastes like aioli based sauce or am guessing. Good. My entree went with the Sesame Chicken Bowl. The bowl comes in three different sizes. I went with the large. Talk about choke food. I was hungry after morning swim set. The amount of chicken give you is local style, the two scoops of rice is mound not scoop, and bowls come with choice of sides. I went with mac salad (cause dah two scoops rice mac salad need I say more) and stir fry vegetables. The mac salad was solid and the stir fry vegetables was nice medley of all fresh vegetables nice crispy and tell fresh vegetables. I was loved the sauce that coated the chicken and then get some on the side. All good stuff.

Little touch comes details. All the bowls or notice all the bowls coming out that day. They had flower in them. It nice one that see back home. All I was thinking if going out of way make it feel like Hawaii that nice touch. 

No doubt plan on coming back because close to my house. The boneless short ribs other dish torn apart to try first. This churro missed out on need try some of that too. Till the next time..."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"The Poke Bowl ride made another stop at one of the newer ones Paina Cafe. Unlike all the ones before Paina Cafe definitely STANDS out lot for different reasons. Not that I will stop my endless journey because seems like every month another poke spot pops out. Paina Cafe is my GO TO spot comes to local grinds. Why I went back try more of the menu and so much more of the menu need to try. I just might need make run after write this review.

My first visit went off the beaten path went with the Ahi Katsu and two orders side action  spam musubi. The Ahi Katsu basically chicken katsu style just with fish. It was awesome. The panko style crust was nice golden brown and the ahi was cooked through on point. It was not dried out at all (just in case thinking ahi cooked all the way..huh) nice moist and then combine with the sauce on top. You can add any amount of toppings want some of them vary in price. I went with kim chee because love kim chee. Kim chee and the spam musubi the perfect compliment. The spam musubi they add furikake into the rice. So not just straight rice looking at it. Nice touch because not everyone does it that style. Spam musubi is universal everyone does it there own way. End the beauty of it is spam, nori, and rice. WInnah!!!

Second visit had go with the tradition some poke action. I was not sure Hawaiian style, shoyu, or spicy? I always go for spicy poke more times then not. Poke Crunch Bowl. Another winnah!! The fish always standard comes Poke make or break. The fish looked fresh nice color, tasted fresh, not fatty at all, and nice square pieces (unlike other spots on the ride hate it when minced up and not nice dice cause true POKE lover know the difference). Add kim chee shocker. The kim chee not sure if make it or buy it. I could just have bowl of the kim chee be set. It not spicy spicy kim chee but just the right amount of kick. Also add masago not only adds great color and makes for great pic. I love the added texture plus the depth adds to the dish. The crunch of the little fried tempura batter, masago, and spicy tuna. Heavenly. The mac salad sort of traditional. They add spaghetti noodles. I have had before give mac salad twist. The star of the show is the poke action for me. 

The menu...stands out is the diversity. Not just like every other poke/burrito bowl. It so so much more. They have kalua pig bowl and beef bowl. Course not just tuna, salmon, and tako. Unlike other spots enjoy and appreciate being from 808. The poke action is legit poke action. It none of this pick your sauce or two just over kill not let the fish stand out. Good poke is all about quality fish. Paina Cafe got u covered. All the poke forgot the bowl just order it by the half pound action or pound. I could have gone there but wanted more full meal with white rice and add some extra toppings. I have not even tapped the menu and look forward to my next visit. 

The interior decor big fan of it. It feels like own style. 808 style for sure!! Some poke places chain multiple locations. Great about this one couple local boys believe owners this only one. The minute you walk in with the slippah action. Scream local style take your slippah off before go into someone house. The hawaiian flag, some of the signs, and the artwork. All the Aloha brand shoyu action. The vibe when you walk in truly got aloha spirt. 

Everyone that works there super cool, friendly, next thing know talking stories like where you from, and again aloha spirit. The music got local hawaiian music chill playing the whole time. 

No doubt. Hot and new Paina Cafe deserves the shout out. I look forward next visit thinking hawaiian style poke."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Well talk about shocked only gets three stars...Or should say not sure why Umami not getting much yelp love except everyone has right too ones opinion. I feel that Umami Burger offer unique experience comes to watching games at a sports book. Trust me use to be one of those sports parley betting addict every weekend. Before realize the house always win. Lol. I can only think of handful of sports book that first off offers food more less quality food not just your normal fried everything bar food. Plus the ones that do offer food usually adjacent or may need to walk some ways get food then bring it back. Not like the sports books are made for food. The chairs made for parley sheet, drink, and sheet write down bets. If in front of small television booth in reality same thing. The thing about Umami literally you just walk up place bet (live betting; that new one for me) and go back too eat, drinking, or talking stories with friends. I came here watch MNF with friends visiting from the 808. I read reviews that need order certain amount on Sunday or on football days in general. Between the three of us ordered everything and the kitchen sink so we were good. We started with truffle fries, nachos, wings, and I had ""The Royale Burger"".

The truffle fries was Amazing! By far the best truffle fries had in long time. I had the ones at more fancy place like Olives that totally suck compare too Umami. The thing that makes them shine above the rest. The homemade truffle cheese that put over the fries, then add truffle oil on top, and nice hot right out of the fryer. Just the smell is divine. If not fungus person this not the dish for you. But if love cheese fries in general these truffle fries take tradition fries too another level. Rich. The Nachos with the short rib meat on top, fresh guacamole (one of the better ones had in town), jalapeño, fresh cilantro sprigs, and the chips. The CHIPS tell fresh chips nice thick corn ones. I could have just eaten chips and salsa whole game be content in life. Me my pet peeves with Nachos like mound of stuff on top but think excess not always better. I love the fact that really had the right amount that none of the chips got completely drowned by the topping that the chips on the bottom bottom still has the crispy crunch. The chicken wings we had six an six. Those were ok nothing really memorable about them. 

The ""Royale"" Burger talk about gourmet burger! This one rivals any of the top gourmet burger joints in Vegas. I can honestly say hit the full list from Gordan, Bobby, Burger Bar, Holstein, Fuku, Bachi, and the only one missing is Guy. The thing I love is the combination of all the flavors. It heavy burger with lots of meat! The burger, short ribs on top, then got truffle cheese, and believe might put hint of truffle oil top it off. Messy burger. Those are the best one that all the good stuff comes out with every bite and gets all over your hands. The ""U"" on top of all the burger that nice touch that definitely  Umami style. The burger buns are on point. Few more reading description that need get me some next visit. 

The service was five star for me!!!! Our server was on it. This was on FOOTBALL day or say MNF. Our server was friendly and during the game on it making sure never empty on our beers. Since first timers all around answered all our questions. 

If one thing that had issue. Maybe only had one hostess working that night. Not sure if we sit ourselves down or go hostess stand get seated no sign. From the outside looks more like lounge then restaurant restaurant. I never checked out the Beer Garden. 

Umami Burger is awesome. I look forward too trying more of the burgers next time."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"So finally got around to trying El Dorado Cantina. I know the place has gotten lot of hype mostly five star kind since day one. In my humble opinion feel like the food was good but nothing trendsetting or off the charts. The food would be 3stars. The service, entire staff, and Chef Paco not doubt five star experience. Everyone on the staff super friendly from the moment you walk in from the hostess, the wait staff, and Chef Paco that guy no doubt love the man passion not only for his food! See Chef Paco walking around the dining room introducing himself, asking for feedback, checking make sure everything is great, and fun friendly guy easy make conversations. I know one of his regular customers. So next thing know started short conversation talking stories about our mutual friends. He telling me about his family flan that passed on from generation to generation that on the menu Our waiter was great came for dinner with friend that also had El Dorado bookmarked. We had few questions being first timers and even asked is could get one of each empanada. He came back said it was ok. So between the two of us got in few things for first timers.....

We started with the empanada like mention the menu choice of three different ones but asked if could get one of each. The cheese, chicken, or beef. I felt like the cheese was the best one out of the three. The portion size was pretty size although was appetizer. My first thought was looks like mini pizza pockets. The presentation liked with the sour cream drizzle on the bottom and nice little shredded red cabbage salad with salsa on the side. Nothing really that was wow. The wings was ok. Just your ordinary basic fried wings with side of ranch and celery sticks. We ordered on the spicy side since my friend likes spicy food. It had not much of kick at all. Our entree we went with street tacos. We ordered one of each (six different ones on the menu) split each one. They were all solid street tacos. We finish was complimentary flan with your yelp check in. The family flam that Chef Paco passed on to him. I love the flan! It not as custard but more dense then regular one. So not as much jiggly going on. Still had nice cream, rich, and filling with every bite. The caramel crust on top was on point. 

The only thing that found odd. Every item that came out was not HOT HOT. Not in spice level but temperature. My idea of street taco you heat the tortilla! Whatever your protein choose throw that on flat top or what not then put both together. Maybe since the restaurant literally next to strip club and way back the building was LVAC. Not sure where the kitchen is or how the place is set up. It was consistent through out our whole meal. The wings thinking deep fry then out but again not even warm warm. Empanada same the filling was not smoking hot take that first bite or cut each on in half since we shared everything. It would have made the dining experience better one.

The table side guacamole or salsa. It looks cool but we never had enough room try that one next visit. They run special all the times on different days of the week. Sunday that one of the better days our waiter was telling us. The Happy Hour prices especially the food times are steal of deal. Like not been mention before might not be in the best of areas, or could get lost thinking going to Sapphire or El Dorado Cantina. Literally both front doors next to one another. If not been El Dorado Cantina place worth checking out. The bar area nice size. Lots of televisions to watch sports, decor has different vibe, and hell if feel adventurous always go next door keep the good times rolling or taking it whole another level. LoL!!!!!"
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"I had friends visiting from back home. They wanted to check out this new all you can eat Korean BBQ spot that got good recommendation from another mutual friend. Shouts! Always down for Korean BBQ especially all you can eat. Over the years just like ramen the growth over the past ten years is nuts. I could count only handful of spots now there all over the valley. Arirang Korean BBQ is still relatively new spot opened couple months ago near the UNLV campus or off major intersection of Maryland Parkway and Flamingo. It not exactly the most pleasant part of town just keeping it real. The little shopping area that it located in looks run down and wonder how the business that are there stay open. Arirang Korean BBQ is located next to CVS. It depends the direction coming from because you could pass it or look for the CVS.

The outside not exactly welcoming or just odd for me. Once you walk inside realize it really nice set up. The ice cream MACAROONS. Talk about first food impression between the vibrants colors and literally smack turn left see in open refrigerator display. The universal smell of all you can eat Korean BBQ all the food grilling you just want sit down and dig in. They have all your banchan set up before we sat down. They have nice assortment. Honest seen lot more at other Korean BBQ spots but the staples like kim chee (my favorite along with japchae) and had japchae all I need and order refill on both. It all you can eat so have couple less not exactly deal breaker for me. The menu I really like all the pictures comes to the proteins and sides. They basically have three different set prices comes to the all you can eat. The cheapest is lunch, middle price, and highest price or go by A, B, C. We went with the middle. The biggest difference is not getting some of the premium meats like ribeye, kalbi, and couple other things. For us the things that came with the middle menu was mainly the stuff we wanted tongue more tongue, pork belly, and couple more items. We got the baby octopus that not sure if going like it. It was much better then I expected. The sauce or marinade made big difference in flavor. It was not rubbery at all. It had kind of teriyaki sweet flavor to it. One worth trying for sure plus interesting see it curl it once hits the girl or thinking it still alive. ;) All the sides are solid. At one point they put the kim chee on the grill. We found interesting or never seen that done before. The server was telling us that the owner recommends or most part see them put some on the grill. It does add different twist but would stick with traditional way. 

The Ice Cream Macaroon Sandwich. Da Bomb!!! Disclaimer NOT part of the all you can eat menu. The server never told us. We kind of figured the way things set up not part of the pre set menu. They look so dam good we expected pay for it and well well worth it. We ordered the Strawberry, Green Tea, and Mango. I ordered Green Tea and Mango. I never tried the Strawberry but my friends said was ono. The Green Tea and Mango was perfect way end great meal. The things truly stood out. They have this perfect uniform shape crazy. The whole time never loses it shape. You would think ice cream would melt it would fall out NOPE. The macaroon and ice cream could have separate be loving dessert life. I would!!! The colors so vibrant and the green tea love the color pink macaroons with green tea ice cream. I know pay extra but would do best save room for one of them. They do offer other desserts besides Ice Cream Macaroons.

The service was totally five stars!! The minute we were greeted when walked in, they were on top of constantly changing out  grill, keep up on our drinks, friendly, and great service. 

The prices are most part same like other spots around town."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Talk about truly UNIQUE experience in Vegas. I know thinking really?? Just dam driving range when you break it down. But the TRUTH is the place is so so so SO SO much more then just driving range. I know in Vegas bigger seems to be better and all about unique experience. Topgolf hits all the requirements. First impression walking to the front entrance the four story building just massive face value. When you walk in you it like sort of disneyland with each floor had its own personality, or world with different forms of entertainment. The main level walk in (second floor) they have two HUGE wide screens big open atrium area with different seating from lounge seats, bar tables with bar stools, and some face the widesreen or bar tables see people hitting balls. They even have tiny sports book that can play bets on football. I came here with cousins from Portland, OR watch some Thursday Night Football. They even have props bets like Super Bowl that bet who scores the first touchdown, etc... FYI my cousins been to the Topgolf in Portland, OR obviously size no way can compete with this location but even they were blown away by the size. They have bar area on every level. The top floor or fourth floor it more of a true ultra lounge feels with live Dj playing music. Between the fourth and third floor even have swimming pool. The music playing am sure from the Dj but current music and stuff get all party mood or club mood. Crazy. It takes golfing range to another level. 

The golfing part not much of golfer. I meet my cousins for the food but also just check it out. My cousins been to the location in Portland and wanted too see the mother load or battleship of Topgolf. They were not disappointed. They gave me the lowdown on way the golf part works. They take no reservations. It depends on the day of the week and time the wait. Like anything on the strip nothing cheap about Topgolf from food, golf, or drinks. It goes by groups so it actually not that bad when spilt it up with six others. The thing makes it current with high tech experience. All the golf balls has trackers so can literally follow your ball and keep tracks of point if you land it in certain spots. Or hell just enjoy the backdrop of the strip or the massive wide screens that have some sports on. No need brings clubs they provide them. Each driving range spot have nice lounge chairs kick back and server come by if wants drinks or food. 

The food. Honest I had no expectations cause thinking growing up few times went driving range nothing good or memorable about driving range food. Topgolf the food is pretty awesome. We ordered three appetizers to share between three of us. We got the kalbi short rib tacos, Greek Chicken Skewers, and Topgolf Wings (mango habanero). They were all amazing!! I would recommend all of them. The Skewers not only was the chicken cooked perfect but the tzatzaki sauce that was the key. It brought the whole dish together, The kalbi short rib tacos was my favorite of the three. Not only was the kalbi the da bomb. I could just have whole plater of kalbi. Instead of taco shell use steam bun. So more cross from peking duck with steam bum. It was so good. The Topgolf wings they have few different sauces choose from. Mango Habanero it has nice late kick. Be warned! The carrot and celery stick or not stick but peelings. Weird. I would have preferred regular traditional carrot and celery sticks. The wings were solid. The menu not that big or crazy. I like that fact. It simple food some of it take another level. 

No doubt if looking for something different to do and with group or small one. Topgolf is great spot. It comes to parking I parked at the MGM parking lot and walking  down the street. The parking lot or valet for Topgolf not that big. If the lot full pretty much nightmare/"
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Hi Star Auto Center ended up being my last resort out of default. I was looking too get my front bumper totally replaces since I wrecked it in accidents few months ago. I started by going too Bumper Medic but the owner told me nothing he could do since not have the right equipment. He suggested another business in the same building couple doors down does auto body repair work. The shop was closed so came back the next day only too find earliest could do the job was the following week. He hated too turn away business but suggested check out HI Star another auto body repair shop in the same building couple doors over. Not only was I looking too take care of my front bumper issue but my car was making grinding noise (hoping had more too do with my bumper then my brakes). Thankfully they were not swamped able too take my car in. 

HONEST mechanic. Maybe I have been lucky the last two times or have my own definition of HONEST. Or really is there even such a thing as a HONEST mechanic in this day and age???? Well all I can tell you is my experience and let you be the judge. So went in told them need front bumper replacement and probably be more problems under the hood or not, One of the owners Gary comes out takes a look the damage. I was telling him the things untrained eye or the issues had in my mind. He was very attentive too my words and then was very thorough went over the damage outside and looking under the hood. There could be more structural damage that only way could till once take off the bumper. So even his estimate up front with me not sure be the exact but something close. He first thought was think limited damage only too the bumper! My luck with cars always more then one thing wrong. So went back inside the store sitting in the office getting the estimate. This is WHERE am huge FAN of Hi Star Auto Center. He was making rounds calling different businesses looking for the parts for new front bumper, after market, or rebuilt ones. Really was making the rounds (not only him think might be his partner or dad but both guys were on the phone hustling looking for parts; even calling places in Utah). Any customer appreciates seeing that effort first hand. I did. Once he found one places (my car is older 1999 too be fair not as easy too find parts) only had brand new parts listed the prices (next too him heard the exact price quote) for both upper and lower part. He told me could refurbish the lower part save big chunk of money. The best part was they could get it done by the following day!! 

I left it overnight but asked them too look into other issues that could be not limited just too the  front bumper. Unfortunately my whole brake system was shot too hell. I had too replace the whole thing pads too rotor. Gary called me the same day dropped it off told me the problem quoted me price and told them no way playing around with my brakes. It was my second worst nightmare so not unexpected. 

Naturally one can imagine costly job. One that with each problem felt there were HONEST with me. They were scrambling too find the best price and made the suggesting for the refurbish part or had their guy rather then buy brand new. The quality of the work. Awesome!!! I got use too looking at wreck of bumper too really front end looked BRAND new back in 1999 got it zero miles. The whole bottom piece the guy or whoever does it amazing work. You would think brand new part rather then someone artwork. Sure maybe costly job but they even washed my car inside and out when I got it back.

Not sure if you get the best price in town (felt like fair price) all I know you get quality work, service felt like they cared about me then just another customer, on it communication through the whole process, and would got back again. The one thing is you need put certain amount down before do the job or pay the whole thing upfront easier. Well worth it."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Thank U..YELP...for helping me find a company that truly worthy of five-stars status!! My A/C unit finally saw its last leg after nice run of over twenty years. Any home owner can associate more so with older home my home over twenty years old. Things break down and A/C unit is just one of the BIG ones. I have been blessed with great unit that lasted long long time. HVAC companies there so many out there who can you really trust or feel like getting honest opinion. I went to Yelp first thing notice is the amount of reviews. HVAC company it not like food there ton of reviews that can base opinion on. No other company near the amount of reviews. I went through lot of them. I never used HVAC company so figure give Legacy Air call. 

Legacy Air first visit Jason (irony saw him three times) came out easy talk too. I explained him the situation basically my heater not working. He went up on the roof found that one of the installation panels was falling off needed to be replaced. He took picture so I could see for myself. Explained me the broken panel was causing unit shut down went to the safety measure. I gave him the approval go ahead changed the panel. Once the panel got changed the heater working again. The whole time explained the situation throughly, professional, and feel comfortable that honest work. Jason called me earlier see if available for earlier appointment. I had schedule for 2-6 but got the work in the afternoon. 

Unfortunately couple hours after got the panel changed the unit went off again no heat. I called Legacy Air back up and the next day talked about coming back out. They honestly went out of the way find time that would work. I made plans unknowing that the unit would breakdown again. The second visit Jason came out again. He found that the computer component needed to be replaced. I asked him give me quote. He had do some research then left message with the quote. The second visit talked at length about long term. The last want drop major bill after another only realize that money more well spent in getting brand new unit. Talk about HONEST business. The whole time Jason never once pushed me to get new unit. He explained the options throughly and in all reality unit is over twenty years ago. Bottom line....Jason telling me about Legacy Air offers financial aid through Well Fargo as a payment option. I told him needed time think about my decision. Second visit never got charged service fee. I made decision get new unit. The next step set up meeting with finance guy came over to the house. Sorry forgot name. He was awesome. Just like Jason went over everything thoroughly going over the finance program. I had questions about why they use American Standard. He showed me info based on consumers reports highest rating and other reasons behind it. I felt comfortable not knowing anything about the brand name should get or brand??? It obvious they listen too their customers! The bank is on the spot once they call. U will know if financing through Well Fargo is option for you. Once got approved set up another date for the guy come out changed over the units. 

The third visit...Jason telling me that in the start no need for me be there if wanted too get other stuff done. I went out for swim set start my day. They were right at the house on time 11am with crane ready and started the process. It got done in timely fashion. I could not be more happier with my unit!!!! 

Maybe could have done more research on cost. At the end of the day wanted to find company that does honest work, wanted get the work done before the dog days of summer, and fair shake/care about customers. Every step even the ladies that talked to on the phone setting up appointments was friendly, easy convey my issues with my unit, and ***TIMELY**** hands down every appointment they spot right on time. Refreshing unlike utility company wait around for hours. If need A/C unit looked at Legacy Air is company that would highly recommend!"
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Talk about ""Hot New Business"" yelp style. Not often get into the whole boba drinks but every once in while get my boba on. Brew Tea Bar forget the boba (not literal sense because every time stopped by added boba) truly about the Teas. Boba balls are by itself the bomb. I love that not only generous with the amount but the texture and flavor of the boba. Tea not something I normally drink more of espresso or sugar coffee drinks get at Starbucks. Brew Tea Bar opened my eyes to another world and really the best part is lot more refreshing then coffee. The endless amount of flavors that can choose from besides you can come up with your own combination. The styles from the milk teas, my favorite the sea salt creme (not idea what it is but all I know is creme layer on top, and once stir around makes the world go around in perfect tea harmony), or slush. Think missing one other style. As you can imagine am sure there is something for everyone. The guys are extremely knowledgeable about the Tea they serve very impressed. They can even break down history lesson if you want. My first visit tried the Mango Sea Salt Creme. I mention earlier talk about refreshing drink! It not only had the right amount of mango flavor but add the Creme it was divine. I associated more like Thai Ice Tea with the Creme but at WHOLE another level cause Mango much more refreshing and more addicting. If you like sweet drink any of the Sea Salt Creme only way. 

My second visit tried the Berry Lovers Crepe. Talk about all giddy for Crepes. I went with my roommates for desserts after dinner. My roommate was telling me never seen me more excited about food. It been long time recall having good crepe. The pictures saw on yelp looked amazing. I watching the gentlemen put together the crepe fresh, every step putting on the fresh fruit, whip cream, nutella, and then the kicker green tea ice cream. It really was seeing artist painting his mona lisa. Truly looked that good had no idea the best way to attack it. I was in awe of it. The flavors was unreal good. The combination of nutella and green tea ice cream. Never thought of or think would be that addicting. It was beyond addicting was the perfect marriage of flavors. All the fresh fruit the strawberries, blueberries, and think bananas. No bruises on any of the fruit, all looked hell of fresh, and each one tasted sweet. The Green Tea Ice Cream you would have to add on. The Green Tea Ice Cream is by far the best Green Tea Ice Cream ever had in life. I asked them if could order scoop of it by itself the next time. It super expensive stuff they could not afford sell it by the scoop. I can understand why cause the depth of the ice cream unreal. Never had one that strong of green tea flavor but yet perfect balance nice creamy and still taste like ice cream. The portion size if great. My roommates shared one while I eat whole one myself. I made room for dessert. lol. I also ordered the Taro Slush with boba wash it all down. The scoop of fresh Taro on top really nice touch and tasted awesome. I love the color of the Taro in drinks and the Taro Slush not only looked the part but tasted the part. If looking for filling drink the Taro Slush is the way to go. Between the crepe and Taro Slush. I could barely stand up for all the food/drink., 

My third visit tried the Coconut milk tea. Talk about Haupia! It was the perfect liquid Haupia drink. So so so refreshing. 

Only draw back is the place is small so when it gets crowded no place sit down. The decor is pretty plain outside of the cool Brew Tea Bar sign. I enjoy the asian style tables. The way they display all the base teas in glass jars. The fact that can see them make the crepes. Cool. It perfect entertainment for the kids. The whole staff at Brew Tea Bar is super friendly, know their Tea, and by the second visit all within same week the guy remembered my name. They have stamp card program ten stamps the next one free. 

Brew Tea Bar is great place go anytime of the day just chill with friends."
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Never been much of a dim sum person in general. Gosh it been years the last time went to one forgot the whole concept. Pearl Ocean it definitely brought back found memories of dim sum! 

Pearl Ocean located in the Lucky Dragon. Second reason came for dim sum never been to Lucky Dragon so got to walk about small property for the first time. Pearl Ocean located on the  second floor. I meet up with friends visiting right when they open at 11am. I was surprise but there was another group that was waiting before the doors open. It got me excited thinking that good sign people line up before the place even opens?? lol. The restaurant interior is really cool. It has lot of personality and kind of big circle open area dining area and all along the outside have booths. The artwork on the walls look all original and pretty cool designs, Very open relax vibe with the high ceilings in the restaurant. 

The food there was three of us. We did decent job of taking down small part of good size menu. Think in all ordered something like eight to 10 dishes all together. So rather then  write them all out. I just tell you the ones that stood for me. The Dumpling section was one of my favorites. Two dishes ordered the squid ink and shrimp xo dumplings that out of control tasty. The squid ink love the color! The fillings in both were solid. The short ribs were good but not person like work for the food. Just me. The noodles dishes were also stand out section. The pan fried noodle with seafood could have had whole plate and be in noodle heaven. It nice hearty with lots of different seafood and nice assortment of vegetables. The thing about the noodle dishes feel like more like normal size then dim sum size. It also reflected in the price just fyi. The boiled beef with enoki mushrooms had no expectations. It ended up being solid choice. It extremely light because the mushrooms and sprouts are the carbs so to speak. It was really refreshing and good one throw in the mix. The dessert section was da bomb!! Make sure you have room and just order it once your done instead of it coming with everything else. We got the sesame seed balls, and mango pudding. Both of them could have had whole portion to myself. The sesame balls talk about #tbt remember growing up in Hawaii going eat at the food court at ala moana and getting the sesame balls. Perfect dessert treat. It just like andagi. It fried donut with outside rolled in sesame seeds and the inside the filling devine and moist. The Mango Pudding is nice creamy and nice balance of Mango and something else. The color is perfect!!! I know missing couple entree but once started coming out lose track...hell dim sum once comes never stops.

One thing that made this dim sum experience no doubt stand out or the lack of dim sum gone to in life. I have always experience traditional with multiple carts that go around and pick the food. Rather enjoy looking at the menu (most part picture of all the items, like list the items by sections, and list prices although some market price so check) then mark stuff on the list and the waiter or waitress checks it off as it comes. Your more then welcome add stuff as you go along. More like normal restaurant comes out then look at the carts and thinking how long that batch been in the cart. 

The service for us nothing but five stars.  The waiter was on it the whole time. He helped us make great selections since it was all of our first time. One thing needs shout out yelp community. My friends reading helpful review mention that local get 20% discount. Mahalos. We asked the waiter and he like for sure just showed him my nevada driver license (just need one id for the bill). He also mention that if have Lucky Dragon players club card get additional 5% off the bill. So we went downstairs all got one. Next go around 25% off the bill. Really not think of dim sum or many restaurants get that kind of discount. It helps cause dim sum might think cheap but the more plates get it adds up REAL quick. 

No doubt plan on coming back again.....!!!!"
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"It been while since wrote a five star review. Forte is a place that exceeded my expectations not only the food but overall experience was very unique. Lot of things that stood out for me. The fact that small family run business, off the strip not in mega hotel, very reasonable price, interior design screaming personality, and am NOT fan of Tapas style of eating but Forte made me FAN. I came to Forte with my cousins from the 808 visiting also avid yelpers and enjoy food like myself. The few times get together over the years here or back home about trying something new. I was excited too get bookmark off my list and just enjoy time around Ohana.

I knew the interior design has personality from watching the episode on DDD. What you see on television can never prepare you for the real thing. I loved every bit of it! Really small restaurant maybe holds 50 people, the bar area is also small just one row of bar stools, and the dining room is divided into two sections. Each one having its own personality. Lot of bright colors, all kinds of different tables, booths, and even the chairs few different ones so really nothing uniform or the same look around from any angle. The artwork (assume someone did) lot of Day of the Dead influence not that came as surprising since european melting pot of food. One artwork that thankfully my cousins pointed out they did Guy Fieri head with the show logo and his signature on the wall. Hell of cool! It literally feels like walking into another world once open the front door.

The food thankfully hanging out with the right peeps or Ohana this night. I got too try lot of the menu. We ordered decent amount of food for three of us. Six items in all. To go back to my earlier point reasonable price our bill was $60 before tip and we were stuffed. Two of us had drink so the bill would have been cheaper if not in the drinking mood. The HH price for drinks on all of them. Steal of deal. I stuck with beer but my cousin had one of the vodka drinks. I pass on trying but she told me was very tasty. 

Home-made chicken soup was pleasantly surprised! We all thought ok on cold night get some soup. It might be bland your basic soup. Instead this little bowl packed bowl full of goodness. The broth was really tasty had depth, ample amount of shredded chicken in it, nice portion of vegetables, and really tasted like fresh Home-made soup. On chilly day could get super size bowl be soup Happy!

Stuffed Grape Leaves was really good. I really enjoyed the filling. The ground pork or assume pork had great seasoning and flavor. The sauce brought everything together along with the grape leaves. 

Beef Stroganoff Ragu was another winnah. Again one of those dishes just give me super size plate be happy with one dish. The pasta dumplings was on point between the filling and the rich, thick, creamy, hearty stroganoff meat sauce. It heavy pasta dish but so good.

Spanish Rice (not sure forgot called) but talk about bowl of rice. It look more like paella without all the seafood or the saffron. It was popping with flavor. Not protein in it. Talk about flavors. It was really good rice.

The star of the show the one dish excited about Bulgarian Mixed Grill. Two dishes that was featured on the show. This was the one most looking forward too and past on the clay pot dish. Awesome. Not only the three different meats. I enjoy the three different sides. The beans and the red pepper something perfect compliment. If one dish NEED too order if first time, many times, or only time this is the one. 

The only dish that not fan of was the Octopus in Olive Oil. Yay it has really nice depth of Olive Oil had the Octopus. Saying sometimes can have too much of good thing. Olive Oil was the killer for me. The rice that served with was bland not very good dish overall.

Outside of the one dish everything was awesome. All the food felt like had great depth of flavor. LOVE LOVE the atmosphere very much different then most restaurants in Vegas. Great spot to hang out with family or friends over drinks, some food, and weekend they even have live music. The service was fabulous. Looking forward too my next visit!!!"
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Always wanted to check Bonefish Grill out since it open just never got around to it. I read some reviews (most part seem more positive then negative ones) and really like the logo/concept of the restaurant. It really has little bite of everything from Steaks, Seafood, and just good diversity throughout the menu. I like one section of the menu can choose the cooking option you want from healthy to standard fare. I went with the family so got see few different items on the menu for my first time. My first impression the entrance really stood out cause not that many restaurants that have the revolving door. It nice with the Bonefish Grill logo and kind feel like taking you on spin into another world or Bonefish Grill World. lol. The whole interior has very modern decor from the bar area to the dining room. The booth that are higher off the ground on one side then have middle area that more like high bar stool tables and then again more booths but lower then the other side. The waitstaff all wearing chef wears coat that was confusing at first impression. I work as cook. So I was like wow so the chef brings out all the food. Nice. Once sat down found out just the waitstaff uniform but one that could appreciate. The decor from all these different style selfs all decorated with different stuff really make for great atmosphere. They do have private dining room or private room that can rent out. 
 
The food.....Like mention went with my brother family so got try few appetizers and got see few dishes. We started with Steamed Edamame and Fried Calamari. The Steamed Edamame it tasted like they steamed it in some kind of tea. It was really good. It was steamed perfect once got into every edamame was nice hot, moist, and cooked right. It refreshing then your normal oil sauté edamame. I can do both but always nice mix things up in life from time to time. The presentation must say LOVE it!!! Not only cause the bottom basket can put shell in. But feel like keeps it warmer longer with the bamboo steam baskets (or think dumplings that the basket they use). It also come with the seasoning but our waitress warn use can be overpowering and if want just put little bit or none on top. I felt like tasted great without it. The Fried Calamari. The thing that stood out for me not only was it well battered, crispy, moist, and the peanut dipping sauce was nice change instead of red sauce get at every italian restaurant. Also they add bell peppers added nice touch and different texture along with the calamari. Both appetizers would highly recommend.

My entree went with the Spicy Tuna Bowl. Not sure the best way to describe it then LOT of things going on and none of it collectively made much sense. Sometimes less can be better especially comes to presentation. Spicy Tuna Bow all over the place. The Seared Tuna enjoyed. It had nice even sear all around, cooked perfect, and tasted like sushi grade tuna. The passion fruit salsa was not very good. Usually the ratio of passion would be more then the peppers and onions. It was completely opposite. It was to citrus or vinegar based. The carrot salad whatever was exactly whatever had no flavor and no real purpose except fill up more space. The avocado must say was perfect ripe, nice green not bruises, and tasted fresh delicious. The jasmine rice was great. So for me the whole dish was mixed of emotions. I ordered side of truffle mac and cheese. I have to put it up there with some of the best truffle mac and cheese in Vegas. I loved the balance of truffle and cheese. Like the breadcrumb crust on top they finish the dish. The curly noodles instead of your normal macaroni noodle added nice touch. My brother ordered ride eye that looked great. Sister-in-law ordered one of the street tacos again looked great. They both enjoyed there meal. One of my nieces she ordered the Kobe burger. Dam that good looking burger!!! 

The service was excellent. Our server was fabulous the whole night. 

I was surprise thinking would be pretty pricey but it very reasonable. Not cheap but still less then strip prices and get high end feeling just looking at the interior decor. I can see myself coming back again try more of the menu"
iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,"Talk about the thriving downtown culinary scene. It rare that go downtown mostly cause going anywhere near casino on my days off flat out avoid. I work in the casino industry. I must applaud the effort cause downtown its come long long way!!! Especially Fremont street with the experience but more with all bars at one end and then all these small restaurant. To be clear Carson Kitchen not located on Fremont but Carson Street is literally minutes off it. Like anything downtown parking not the most ideal situation but have all the hotels that can park at or street parking. Carson Kitchen the best idea is the Fremont Experience parking garage literally right there or Downtown Grand just accross the street. 

I was pretty psyched about checking out Carson Kitchen for the first time. The best part was my cousin visiting with her family from the 808. She an avid yelper so I knew it was ONNN came first timers. It was for all of us. Talk about the BENEFITS of party of six or more. The only time take reservation if you have party of six or more. I went with my brother family my two nieces, my cousin her family niece and nephew, and then there me. So talk about spread of food. We pretty much ordered every appetizer on the menu. Literally had the Bacon Jam, Devils Eggs, Crispy Chicken Skins, Gyro Tacos, Meatballs, Scallops, some kind of popcorn shrimp, and Thai BBQ Pizza.  

Bacon Jam was my favorite appetizer! The bacon jam talk about divine spread that was not only fabulous on the grilled believe baguette sliced bread. The charcoal mark the crispy bread then nice spread of not only bacon (the nice part you could see pieces of bacon rather then I all grounded or cooked out puree), caramelized onions, and nice sweetness like any jam. Devine. Definitely you can taste the hint of bacon grease in the jam also! It perfect for the kids. Or on this night my nieces and nephews was enjoying the bread by itself. 

The Crispy Chicken Skin was the second winnah for me. It tastes like fried pork grinds chips you see in bags. I know not PORK but the texture similar and something that think of if never had crispy chicken skin. I loved it by itself. They have almost like sweet and sour dipping sauce that comes with it. I like the whole tiny fry basket for presentation. Truthfully came to presentation you can clearly see the Kerry Simon style. High end food. They incorporate unique severing dishes. The devil eggs presented on wine bottle cut in half. 

The other appetizers it had no WoW factor in any of them. The Devils Eggs like any other Devils Egg. It looks great but only thing that makes it stand out is the caviar on top. It such small amount nothing rave about. The Gyro that was pretty solid. I think you get only two per order but since we had big party ordered two orders. So had four on one plate. The grilled dough they use as shells are nice crispy and hot. The filling very generous, the lamb real tasty cooking spot on, the tzatziki, cucumber, and tomato. All together makes for hearty taco! Just warning so much stuff that it drips with every bite!!! The Meatball by itself was ordinary but the sherry foie gras cream sauce now that was amazing. I could see that sauce on pasta dish would die for. The two together for me just never worked. The Scallops was seared to perfection just between the sauce and the starch nothing exciting. So much going on forgot the components where just blah. The pizza was ok but so many other good things pizza last thing need to try at Carson. My opinion. 

I ordered the Black Rice & Oxtail Risotto. I really enjoyed. It not very often you see Black Rice on any menu. The combination of Oxtail Risotto sounded too good not to pass up. It had interest contrast with different texture rices. Oxtail made it nice and hearty. I think my brother had perfect analogy almost like hearty jook. The rice is not going be al dente since two different types. No doubt perfect dish on cold Vegas day and pretty filling dish. My cousins dishes looked pretty good. I had no room after all the apps tried more food. 

The service was spot on fabulous. The whole staff on on it from the minute we sat down. I found great is when you get the bill they give you book. I know right like ""What the Hell??"". Guess you can sign it if you want. All the kids signed it. I thought that was cool. 

The interior is very modern with community tables and upstairs outdoor patio area. 

No doubt Carson Kitchen place highly recommend if looking for place eat downtown."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"After  years of seeing the commercials for Golden Corral, I was excited to hear that one was finally opening up in Las Vegas.  Gone would be the days of contemplating a drive to Kingman AZ or Hesperia CA to dine at what looks like a really great place.  Having now been twice within two weeks (against my better judgement), I can honeslty say I am let down.  I remember going to a Golden Corral as a kid.  It had the best baked potato bar around.  I can remember my family being so upset when they went out of business in SoCal.  This, however, is not the same Golden Corral I remember from back then.  It is just your average every day run of the mill over priced buffett with chceap food.  Not that it is all bad.  The salad bar is solid and seemed mostly fresh.  And the Ceasar dressing is on point.  The hot food though, hit and miss really.  The Bourbon Street chicken was perhaps my favorite dish of the night.  The orange pork was alright as was the sesame chicken but neither were anything worth writing home about.  The egg roll was small and chewy. The lo mein was made with the same noodles as the spaghetti.  That kind of threw me off.  Neither were the kind of noodles I think they strived to be. The meatloaf was smothered in ketchup the way my mom made it when I was a kid so that was nice.  The green bean casserol was good if for no other reason than it was covered with fried onions which happen to be one of my favorite snacks.  My dad and step-mom spent a few minutes discussing the sausage with bell pepper and onion trying to determie what kind of sausage it was.  The sign said it was Italian sausage.  If it takes two people immersed in conversation for five minutes and a third party to finally look at the sign to know for sure what it was, it was probably not the best representation of that food.  On to dessert, the bread pudding was awesome the first time I went while the cobler was not worth more than two bites.  The second visit had the bread pudding looking so horrible I just moved right past it and onto the pies. I got a slice of apple pie.  The apple filling was fine but the crust was not good.  It lacked flavor and the texture was dry and crumbly.  Not flakey likea good pie crust should be.  As for the chocolate fountain that seems to be like a signature of the chain, it seems very unsanitary.  You have this recirculation of liquid chocolate that sees children coating more than their desserts.  I saw hands going in there too.  Furthermore, these desserts are taken out of the restaurant leading to food sticks, food and stickiness all over the parking lot.  It was more sticky than a movie theatre floor.  My dad has said he will not be back and I have to agree.  In a town full of buffets, there are better quality options with better prices."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"After weeks of trying to visit Astronomy Aleworks I have finally made it in. Turns out I was always trying to go in too early. They run somewhat later hours than your typical 24 hour Vegas pub. This is a microbrew tap/tasting room afterall. And it is conveniently located in the booze district within walking distance of Crafthaus, Bad Beat, Las Vegas Distillery, Las Vegas Winery and Grape Expectations. If you are thinking of a pub/booze crawl, this is where you need to begin.

Astronomy Aleworks has a decidedly space/sci fi theme to it. You will see paintings of Star Wars and Star Trek inspired scenes. I spied models of the Millenium Falcon, a Tie Fighter and Boba Fett's pod. Aside from that, the atmosphere in the room is as thin as Mars' atmosphere. It is very simple and even plain. But shining like Venus at an apparent magnitude of -4.6 is the beer. And there is nothing wrong with that.

There were 12 beers on tap during my visit. Each one unique, distinct and cleverly named to continue the space/sci fi theme. I ordered a flight of 4 4oz. beers for $8 to get an sample of what they serve. The guy behind the bar told me to start calling out numbers. I ordered a 1, 3, 5 and 9. That is a Nova Stout, Mars Red, Pluto Is A Planet and Ursa Minor, respectively.

The Nova Stout, clearly, is a stout. Not as heavy or creamy as a Guiness, this stout still has the wheat toast and coffee notes that make it a stout. My favorite of those which I tried in my flight.

The Mars Red is a red ale. I picked up on a mix of bitter and sweet notes on this one. And a slight astringent quality. Not bad in a flight but I'm not sure I'd order a whole pint.

Pluto Is A Planet is an IPA and has a counter part NE IPA called Pluto IS NOT A Planet. I believe Pluto is so that is what I got. I am not always a fan of IPAs but this was not at all bad. The hop aroma was very floral. The taste was of grapefruit and grass. Not as bitter as I expected. Depending on my mood, I'd order that again. My second favorite of the evening.

Finally the Ursa Minor, a dark ale reminscent of a stout or porter but not quite as heavy. I was put off by the aroma of this one. I can't put my finger on it but I didn't care for it. The taste was better. Bitter dark malt. Not as sweet or toasty as the stout it resembles. More of a burnt flavor. All in all, an OK drinker but I think I'll explore some other options.

I was greeted fairly quick here. A lot of times I am overlooked at a bar. I appreciate the acknowledgement. There are several varieties of beer here and, from what I've been told, a secret menu. It was recommended I try a ""trifecta"" which is a blend of 3 beers. Forgive me for not remembering the exact recipe. This is a quirky little place offering up some quality craft beers. I'll have to come back to try the rest which I did not try on my first visit."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I am so torn on giving Taco Rico a 3 star rating. The are so many strong reasons I should rate it higher. As others have said, this place is very clean. That is refreshing to see from a little taco shop like this. The service was friendly. I was updated when my order was taking a long time to fill. I was given a free sample of an agua frescas with cucumber and spinach. I was offered a refill on my soda. All points to the positive. 

More points to the positive is the quality of the food. They make everything fresh. My tacos were alright. The meat was hot and perfectly cooked. The refried beans were on point. The rice was about the best I've had. It was full of flavor and fluffy. Even the various salsas were quite good. The one I had, roasted I think, was not too hot but gave a nice flavor boost to my tacos. Salsa was not 100% necessary but a welcome edition for sure.

So why am I giving only a 3 star review when everything is so good? Well, there is more to the story. I was picking up lunch for my office. I ordered a total of 6 combo number 1s. That combo comes with 4 tacos, rice, beans and a drink. Yeah, I had my hands full with this one. Anyhow, we all wanted a variety of tacos. Carne asada, pollo, al pastor, carnitas. We wanted it all. Nobody ended up getting al pastor. Taco Rico didn't have any made. So I made the decision to switch to the carnitas. I got all of the first 5 orders placed and was ready to place my own. I was going to try asada, pollo, carnitas and barbacoa. I ended up with two each asada and barbacoa because I was told they would not give me all different meats. They claimed it was too much work to make so many different tacos with different meats. That was disappointing. So was the fact that their credit card terminal was not working so I had to bum some cash off a co-worker. This was supposed to be her birthday lunch. She was not supposed to pay. 

To further my disappointment, it took nearly 50 minutes to get my full order. 50 minutes! Apparently 11:00 AM is too early for lunch because I had to wait for much of it to be cooked. That includes the rice. Meanwhile my co-workers were back at the office getting more and more hungry. All but the one co-worker that is.

My assistant in this lunch venture, whom I am happy went with me, was a great help in translating everything. The cashier spoke English but I think it was easier for her to speak Spanish. It bothered me a little bit when she started ignoring me and speaking directly to my companion. Whatever. I got the message. It may have been second hand but I felt well informed. 

In the end, the service was friendly, the food was fresh but average, the tacos are small, and the beans and rice I could have used more of. The delays and frustrations of limitations are just too much for me to overlook. That is why this is a 3 star review today."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"A brand new business and I have been here two time already in just a four day span.  Must be good, right?  Right.

The Sandwich Spot is so close to home for me and yet I never knew it was opening up.  I don't go by the shopping center it is in all too often.  It was a co-worker who told me about it.  I am glad he did.

For $9.49 you can get any of their 24 (?) sandwiches, a drink, and a bag of chips.  Not bad.  Perhaps the price is more than that of a place that offers $5 12 inch sandwiches but there really is no comparison.  The breads here are more artisan and the toppings are fresh.  They also have some good sauce selections to choose from.  More on that below.

The first time I tried the Sandwich Spot I ordered a classic Reuben sandwich.  Pastrami, sauer kraut, cheese and Thousand Island dressing on toasted marble rye bread.  Was it the biggest, baddest, thickest stacked Reuben around?  No.  But I can't remember the last time I had a Reuben so good.  The meat was sliced thick enough to not taste like cheap lunch meat but not so thick as to not be sandwich friendly.  It was tender and flavorful.  The sauer kraut was good and crisp with a bit more sour than most krauts I've tried elsewhere.  The bread was the most impressive part of this sandwich when compared to others.  I love a good Reuben on marble rye but oh so often the bread is toasted too much and tears up my mouth.  This was just right a toasty crunch yet still soft enough to not kill me.  That is a hard balance to acheive.

On my second visit I ordered a Winston Cooper on Dutch Crucnh bread.  I highly recommend the bread for any sandwich.  Soft on the inside and crunchy on the out.  Awesome.  As for the heart and soul of the sandwich itself, roast beef, pastrami, salami, lettuce, tomato, onion, pepperoncinis, choice of cheese and choice of sauce.  For my choices I went with Swiss and Bomb Sauce.  The whole package was nothing short of amazing.  Everything on its own was good but the synergy obtained by the combination is just hard to beat.

The Bomb Sauce I had on my Winston Cooper was good but the Psycho Sauce is truely where its at.  I was brought a small piece of bread with the Psycho Sauce drizzled on as a sample.  It is a mix of the Bomb Sauce and the Garlic Sauce they offer.  The two together form a sort of tangy and spicy sauce almost like a creamy Italian dressing.  The next time I am back I am going to get the Psycho Sauce on my sandwich.  It was just too good.  Hell, I would order a side of it to dip my chips in.  Yes, it is that good.

I can see this place doing really well.  It has some awesome food to offer and the staff is great.  They are friendly and fast.  They talk to their customers.  They get their opinions.  The joke around.  They play a good loud mix of music from hip hop to rock.  This is a cool little shop and a true asset to the neighborhood."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I have come in to Domsky Glass twice in the past two weeks. The first time was for a glass fusing class I found through UNLV Continuing Education. Basically, I came in for about two hours and laid pieces of colored glass mosaic style on a round pane. It was then put into a kiln in my absence two separate times. The first firing was to fuse all the pieces together. The second firing is to ""slump"" it into the shape of a 10"" plate. Other project options were an 8"" bowl or a set of four 4"" coaster. The instructor, Barbara, taught the class how to use the various tools to cut the glass we needed into the shapes we wanted. She showed us how to draw a design, if a design was to be followed, and cut the glass to match the design. I went with a more chaotic amorphous approach rather than adhering to a design. Partly because I did not know what to draw. Mostly because I don't draw well. It was only afterwards that I thought of an idea that I maybe could have figured out. Regardless, I was mostly happy with what I came up with.

Fast forward two weeks and I came back to Domsky Glass for their First Saturday open house and to pick up my final piece. I was surprised by the turn out. The parking lot was already full by the time I got there at 6:00. Inside the workshop was a seating area set up to watch a glass blowing demonstration. It was packed. Very few seats left unfilled. By my estimate, 40 or 50 people. It was good to see that kind of support. It was even more impressive to watch the guys work their magic. Larry, one of the owners, was working on some decorative globe like pieces for a light display. He had two people helping him including a young guy who just started working there day of. He had taken one of the UNLV classes and developed a passion for glass blowing. He is learning the art. The entire time the guys were working the glass they were explaining the entire process. Going over the terminology, history, tools, techniques. It was fascinating to watch. I'm exhausted for them. Unfortunately I don't know what the finished pieces will look like. They have to cool slowly in a kiln to prevent them from breaking. I guess I'll have to go back again to see them.

Domsky Glass is a cool place separated into two main areas, the gallery up front and the workshop/studio. Both offer a very different aesthetic but are both impressive in their own right. The gallery is clean and classy. The studio is more of a factory look. Kilns and furnaces, work benches, tools, shelves. Everything serves a purpose. It isn't exactly pleasing to the eye but it is interesting to see. If you haven't been to Domsky Glass, mark it on your calendars to visit during the next first Saturday open house. It lasts three hours but that time will fly. The glass blowing process offers non-stop entertainment and the gallery offers a feast for the eyes. Well worth the drive down Highland."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I live near the ""Booze District"" so I am familiar with places like CrafHaus Brewery and Bad Beat Brewing. But I had not yet visited Las Vegas Distillery until this afternoon. It had been on my list of places to check out but I kept finding excuses for not doing so. I don't have time. I forgot. I'm not really as interested as I think I am. Well, friends, today I said ""what the hell."" I came in for the 1 hour tour followed by a tasting. I was afraid that trying to book my tour day of would mean limited spots available. As it turned out, I was the only person in my 4:00 tour. Kind of nice to have the personalized tour. Kind of disappointing too. More people should check this place out. They go over the history of alcohol in Nevada. The history of the owner/founder, George. The differences between the various spirits i.e. grains used, added flavors, number of distillations. They talked about the sourcing of ingredients. I could give it all away but that would deprive you of learning it all from the people who know it best. So get on it!

There was a brief tasting during the intial tour. I was given a sample of moonshine and told to drink it fast. It was potent amd had a strong corn flavor to it. Not bad. Then came a sample of an undiluted vodka of 95% alcohol. Holy smokes, that lit me up like a firecracker. It reminded me of rubbing alcohol. Its a good think they don't sell it like that. It could kill somebody.

Following my tour was my tasting. I tried most everything except for the gin and vodka. I care for neither. But I tried the rum and various whiskies, bourbons, ryes and apple pie moonshine. I am usually a rum drinker but not a white rum. I prefer a spiced rum. As for the whiskey, my two favorites were the single grain and four grain bourbons. They are more similar to what I think of when I think of whiskey. I also tried a couple of liqueurs which are in development and not for sale yet. Its a shame too. The Irish Cream was amazing. The chocolate one was good too. The hazelnut was different. It had an almost buttery taste like popcorn. Interesting to say the least.

In the end, my tour and tasting which was scheduled to last 75 minutes took about 45. No doubt due to the fact that I was the only person there. I tried a lot of small samples. None of which I was willing to pay $45+ per bottle for. I wont even pay that much for the booze I know and love. Call me cheap. I wouls have bought a t-shirt for $16 but they only have sizes up to 2X and I wear a 3X. Despite some small disappointments I had a good experience here. The people are friendly and knowledgeable. And it is important to support local businesses. They do. My guide was pushing the winery and breweries in the area. It is nice to see a community forming around this Booze District. I urge you to check it out too. Oh, and be sure to say hello to Honey, the Boston Terrier, who may well greet you at the door."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"The Springs Preserve proves itself as a valid escape from the nearly 2 million people who call the Las Vegas Valley ""home."" It does not, however, let you forget that you are still in the city. The 95 freeway runs right by the Preserve and you can most definately hear the traffic. Not to mention the planes flying frequently overhead. I also heard sirens and helicopters. Yes, you are absolutely in the middle of Las Vegas. Yet you are a world away at the same time.

Walking through the display gardens at the southern end of the Springs Preserve is a pleasent experience. There is a lot of shade and some beautiful displays. The fragrant flowers like mock orange and honey suckle fill the air with a sweetness one does not often experience living in the city. During my visit there were several small groups of people walking, talking and  enjoying the scenery. They weren't necessarily disturbing the tranquility of the gardens but I was looking for more seclusion. I was looking for the hiking trails.

I began hiking at the train station and bike rental booth. I walked strait across the paved 2.21 miles Exloration Loop Trail and started on the road less travelled. I took to the gravel paths if the Crossroad and Cienega Trails. On the Cienega Trail I descended into the wetlands area past reeds and tall marsh grasses. This led me to the southern third of the Exploration Trail which took me back to my starting point. I was not yet done hiking so I went back to the Crossroads Trail to see the rest of what I had missed on the first walk. I headed south the see the Spring Mound and turned back to the north to see northern section of the Crossroads. By this time I was started to get warm and was running out of Gatoraide so I headed back to the train station. I wish had known  was missing the Springs Trail. I did not have a map with me when I set out. I guess I'll check out that one next time. That and the full Exploration Loop Trail. It felt good to get out and enjoy nature.  It is not complete isolation but I'd like to do it again.

I also checked out the museums at the Springs Preserve. My favorite was the Nevada State Museum. From the prehistoric days of the dinosaurs to the modern times, this museum has it all. Fossils of the ancients, intact animals that you can still see today, minig history, native peoples. If you want to learn about the Battle Born State, this is where you should come. It is a beauty of a museum.

The rest of the Preserve caters more to children. The Origen Museum, the Activity Room, the Desert Living Center are all kid friendly. I did not spend much time in any of these areas. That is not to say the information they provide is not useful. It all provides kids a great interactive way to learn for the future.

I can't wait to share this experience with my family. I know a couple people who would enjoy a hike. My family does not do the whole Las Vegas thing and this is just about as far from typical Las Vegas as it gets."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"My visit to Lucille's BBQ was good enough that I would be willing to come back again but I feel there is some room for improvement. I will preface this review by saying that Lucille's was very busy last night which could account for some of the issues I perceived.

My family and I got to Lucille's after 7:00 PM. It was so crowded it was difficult to even get in the front door and to the counter to put us on the list. I gave them my cell number so we could be notified that ours was the next group to be seated. There is a screened in front porch with some bench seating which we took advantage of while waiting. It did take a while but I do not believe it took even the 25 minutes we were quoted. Maybe 15. We were then taken all the way to the back for dinner.

I already knew before arriving that I wanted a tri tip sandwich and a half order of fried green tomatoes. I got garlic mashed potatoes for my side. My step mom ordered a fried chicken sandwhich and my dad ordered a brisket sandwich and a dinner salad. 

While we waited for all of that we were brought a basket of biscuits and apple butter. It was all very sweet but good. Then came our sandwiches. No salad. No fried green tomatoes. I asked about them and they were brought a while later. My dad was going to turn down the salad since it should have come before the meal but he took and ate it anyway. As did I with the fried green tomatoes.

As far as taste, quality and freshness go, the potatoes were good. Lumpy fresh potatoes complete with skins. The tri tip in my sandwich had good flavor but was dry. It needed a healthy dowsing of BBQ sauce. Original I believe. The tomatoes were good. Fried perfectly crisp. A bit of a sour note from being green. It was the sauce I did not care for. I don't know what it is but it reminded me of Burger King's onion ring sauce. I could have done without a plate full of it. Maybe a side of ranch dressing instead.

I love the smells here. And the rustic theming of the various kitch filled dining rooms is cool. Service is friendly though maybe a bit spotty in certain aspects. Food was not disappointing but could have been better.  But again, it was good enough that I would gladly go back again.

UPDATE - Somebody from Lucille's has reached out to me about the issues I have addressed above. They wish to make things right. It is unecessary and, as mentioned above, I do intend to return at a later date. With a future experience to come, my hope is that the improvements I seek are made and I can update my review to a higher score. In the mean time, I should clarify that the server, I believe, removed my dad's salad from the bill as an apology for it being brought after the sandwiches. That along with the PM from the restaurant's management team go a long way in strengthening their customer service score. It is worthy of a half-star bump up to a 3.5 rating which I cannot make known in the actual star rating. Hopefully you are all reading this far to know so."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I came in to Hash House A Go Go for a late breakfast/early lunch. I ordered a mushroom swiss buger because, well, mushrooms. Rather than fries I ordered my burger with a side salad. 

I wanted Italian dressing which they do not have at Hash House. The server told me the salad comes with cucumber ranch or I could choose one of their other dressings. He listed regular ranch and a vinaigrette and a couple of others I can't remember. I chose the cucumber ranch. I probably should have gone with the vinaigrette. The cucumber ranch sounds refreshing but I really couldn't taste much. The salad had potential with the romaine, green onion and radishes. But the lack of flavor in the dressing and the strange chewy croutons (cornbread?) were a turnoff.

The burger itself was good. The meat reminded me of the camp steaks my mom used to cook when I was a kid. Not sure of that is a good thing but it was familiar. It was a big burger for sure. I actually had a hard time finishing it and I am traditionally a big eater. The burgers here are ""stuffed."" Really it was like having two patties with mushrooms and cheese in between. Then there were the standard burger toppings of lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles. The big a$$ knife stuck through the middle to keep the burger together was a bit much. I suppose it was meant to be used to cut the burger in half but I don't roll that way. To me, a simple wooden skewer would have sufficed. I also didn't appreciate the giant spring of fresh rosemary stuck in the top bun. I like rosemary as an herb to flavor foods while cooking but used only sparingly. I am of the school of thought that garnishes should be edible. A woody stem of rosemary is not. On the subject of strange garnishes are the twiggy thinks strewn about my plate. It looked like sticks of burnt uncooked spaghetti. What was that all about? If it doesn't serve a purpose, leave it off my plate, thank you.

Hash House A Go Go is a popular place. They have many locations nationwide that all seem to be busy so they must be doing something right in some peoples eyes. For me, it seems over rated and over priced. Yes, you get a lot of food so the prices are probably fair based on portion size. But if you aren't entirely happy with the food, bigger isn't necessarily better. I enjoy the country atmosphere but the industrial metal chairs are terribly uncomfortable. For those of us who are a little wide side-to-side, the back of the chairs wraps around and digs into the waist and hips. I wasn't really able to sit all the way back so sat forward which led to slipping off a bit. One would think that a place that boasts larger portions would have larger patrons. Appropriate seating would be appreciated. Please take no offense to that statement as it is not meant to be disparaging. Just an honest thought I had while squirming and waiting for my meal. Having now tried Hash House, the curiosity is satisfied and the desire is gone. Will I come back? Perhaps. But it will likely be a while."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I was trying to think of something for lunch today and thought ""hey, I've never tried Tucky's."" Well, I like BBQ and Tucky's is close by so the choice seemed the logical one. I ordered online for a pick-up and was shown a 45-60 minute window. This gave me some time to do some quick shopping before headed to the restaurant. I was actually there within about 15 minutes so I sat in the parking lot for a few minutes. Out of curiosity of the status I checked my email confirmation and it said there was only a 20 minute pick-up window. That was, like, now. So in I went and got my meal right away. I was also given three cups for their three sauces. Soon enough I was on my way home with drool dripping down my chin.

Today I ordered a two meat platter with chopped brisket and andouille sausage. For my sides I got green beans with bacon and potato salad. And the meals come with corn bread and pickles too.

Starting with the brisket, it tastes like BBQ. There was a small pink smoke ring and some of the chunks. And a decent bark. But it seemed a little on the dry side. I tried each of the three BBQ sauces to moisten the meat. I don't know which sauce was which but I like the one with a little more spice (zippy sauce?).

Next was the sausage. Sweet and smokey with a crisp casing. Delicious. A good sausage to be sure. I would have liked a hot link instead but that is by no means a dig on the andouille. I used some of the sauce on the sausage too. The sauce that was a blend of sweet and spicy was good for this purpose. The sweeter of the sauces was my least favorite over all though all were good in their own right.

I ate the pickles and corn bread next. The pickles are thin sliced and quite briney. A nice few bites to wake up the taste buds. As for the corn bread, it was corn bread. A little dense. A bit dry. A hint of corny sweetness. Not much more to be said about that.

The green beans and bacon were fine. The beans were crisp which leads me to believe they are fresh as opposed to frozen which tend to be mushy. These beans could have been cooked less (a quick blanch) to retain more crispiness but they weren't bad. I had hoped the bacon would add more to them. Maybe fry them in bacon grease. Now that would be awesome!

The potato salad was a classic preparation of red potato with onion and celery. It was creamy and tangy as a good potato salad should be. And there was a hint of dill which I am a sucker for. A classic preparation done right.

I did not get to fully experience Tucky's having taken my food to go but I did see that it has a good country kitchen atmosphere that compliments the food it serves. The smell of a smoke pit was not as prevelant as I had hoped but it does smell like a BBQ restaurant. There is no mistaking it. I didn't deal much with the staff as I just picked up and left but that aspect was simple and friendly enough. Tucky's doesn't have my favorite or even the best BBQ but its a good local joint for some solid BBQ. I can see coming back again."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"Yea!  I finally tried Braddah's Island Style.  And I so wish I could like it as much as four stars but I'm not sure that I do.  I'm really on the fence with this one.  Lets start with the positives.  Upon entering I was offered a nice Hawaiian style welcoming into the restaurant.  Mahalo to them for that.  I was asked if it was my first visit and I said yes.  With that I was offered a sample of the kalua pig and huli huli chicken.  Both were very good though I don't always care for pork.  This was on the oily side but still had a great initial flavor.  It is the porky after taste I don't care for.  The chicken on the other hand was a stand out with a sort of sweet and salty taste with a hint of grill char.  So I selected the huli huli chicken to fill my burrito.  When I ordered a burrito I was disappointed to see a generic Mission brand flour tortilla pulled out of the bag.  I mean seriously $7 for a burrito in an 8 inch tortilla?  It turns out they ran out of their usual jumbo tortillas.  So alright, I'll let this one slide.  Next came a very carefully measured spoon of seaweed rice (awesome flavor BTW) and an equally measured spoon of chicken.  It was a new guy making my order and he was being very cautious to the point of me feeling like I was getting ripped off.  But with the addition of the black beans, two kinds of salsa (roasted pine apple and corn varieties) and some shredded cheese I realized just how much was packed into this little tortilla.  There was so much in fact that it could not be fully rolled.  One of the burrito veterans came over for the assist and rolled an extra tortilla around the first and got a nice tightly tucked buritto.  When I reached the register I ordered a can of Hawaiian green tea and was asked if I wanted coconut bark.  I declined the bark as I don't even know what it is.  Not that it matters.  I am not a coconut fan any how.  So I paid and found a table in the corner and took my first bite of an Island Style burrito and honeslty I was not blown away.  Beneath the rice, beans and salsa the flavor of the chicken was lost.  I'm not saying it was a bad burrito but all together it lacked something.  The salsa could have been hotter.  I realize that I got the mild and medium salsas but there just wasn't much to them.  Mostly what I could taste in the burrito was the seaweed rice.  I do love the taste of seaweed so that was nice but overall it was nothing special.  My other issue is the limited menu.  They specialize in burritos, tacos, salads and bowls.  They also seem to have chips and guacamole.  What I really wish they had is musubi but I guess that doesn't quite fit their business model.  I think I will give them another try some time.  Perhaps I'll try another protien other than chicken.  It is my understanding they have steak and fish too though neither were offered as a sample.  I would like to give the steak a try though.  Perhaps I will appreciate the steak more than the chicken and bump up Braddah's to the four stars I know I want to give them."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I have been to this Mimi's Cafe three times in as many months.  Once with my whole family for dinner.  Once by myself for breakfast.  And once with my dad and step mom for lunch.  I think I have pretty well covered the spread at this point and can compose an accurate review.

Lets start with the good.  The bread they bring out in the beginning is pretty awesome.  The mini baguettes are the star of this bread basket.  Soft on the inside while a little chewy on the outside.  Delicious.  Especially with the whipped butter to spread on.  Not that these little loaves need it.  The little football shaped carrot cake/bread pieces are OK but really are better with the butter.  Aside from bread, Mimi's has a really good French onion soup.  It is full of onions and loaded with cheese.  The crouton on top stays crisp just long enough despite floating atop piping hot broth.  This soup is one of my menu favorites at Mimi's.

On to the less that amazing yet still pretty good part of the review.  The salad seems to be enjoyed by my family.  I, however, am less that impressed.  To me, there was not quite enough of the dressing.  A shallot vinegrette I believe.  I suppose it is a good enough dressing I just wish there was more of it for me to taste.  My cheese steak sandwich I ordered for dinner a couple of months back was pretty average too.  Not a major standout but not a horrid sandwich either. The fries on the side are good but I wish the ketchup for them had been left on the table in a bottle so I could smother rather than dip.  I don't like to dip my fries.  But I guess that is just nit picking.  Finally, the chicken cordon bleu sandwich I ordered for lunch was mostly impressive.  Perfectly cooked chicken that was both juicy and crisp topped with cheese, ham, lettuce and tomato on a ciabatta bun.  The ham was awesom and in perfect proportion to the chicken.  the bun was a solid bast and held up to all the ingredients.  All in all, I enjoyed it.  One nagging shortfall was the absence of flavor in whatever kind of spread and/or dressing was on the sandwich.  I would expect something of a honey mustard dresssing.  I don't believe that is what I got.  I had to find a drop to taste on its own to figure out there was any sauce and I am still not sure what it was.  A seasoned mayonaise perhaps?  I'm not sure because it did not taste like much, unfortunately.  It didn't ruin the sandwich but it could have elevated it much more were it done a little differently.

And lastly, the disappointments.  Mostly, breaskfast let me down.  I ordered chicken and waffles.  It took a long time to come out and what I got was a perfectly cooked, thick, fluffy and golden brown waffle topped with two over cooked (I dare say burned) pieces of under seasoned chicken breast.  With enough syrup I made it work but this was not the best chicken and waffles I've had.  I rather expected more.  At least now I know not to order that next time.  There are plenty more breakfast options to choose from.  I'll just have to give those a try."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"For every bit I love McCarran Airport there is an equal and opposite hatred for the same.  

I love flying in and out of McCarran.  I get dropped off at the main entrance and quickly make my way to security without issue.  The lines flow quickly for the most part and sometimes I even come across some friendly TSA agents (though they can be hard to spot).  Depending on which terminal I am flying from I get to see some cool stuff.  When flying Southwest out of the C Gates I get to see the old McCarran that I grew to know as a kid flying out here as an unaccompanied minor to visit my dad.  It brings back good memories.  If I fly to SFO on a different airline (United, Continental, etc) I fly out of the D Gates.  They are much newer and cleaner than C Gates and feel like a mall.  It has a very modern look.  And I love the tram than takes me to the D Gates.  It starts above ground and ends underground.  It is like a mini subway here in Vegas.  Its one of those little things in life that makes me happy.  As for coming home, the trams from both C and D Gates drop you right near baggage claim and it is an easy exit from there.  Usually my dad is waiting there for me.  I have taken the bus and that was a bit of a pain.  I had a hard time finding the bus platform.  Just follow the signs and you'll be fine.  It just may take some time, thats all.

For my hatred of McCarran, picking up incoming passengers as opposed to being one.  I have picked up a buddy of mine twice and both times we kept missing each other with the couple of different bridges from baggage claim to the parking structure.  One time he walked on the  lower bridge all the while I was on the opposite.  The next time he walked the upper.  The confusion did not end there either.  You have different levels of the parking structure with the same number.  Like Level 2 and Level 2M.  Its not just a different section but a totally differnent level.  People on the elevator get lost all the time and end up getting off too soon and getting right back on.  I learned my lesson from picking up my friend so yesterday when I had to pick up my aunt I went in to baggage claim and waited for her.  There are so many escalators for people to come down I did not know where to watch for her.  I nearly missed her despite my best effort.  Nevertheless I did find her and we retrieved her luggage quickly and it was back out to the parking lot of doom.  I should have used the ""Pay Here"" kiosks to get out of the parking lot but no, I left the ticket in my car.  So I proceeded to the pay booths at the exit.  One lane was open that was accepting cash.  I got in that line and sat for nearly 15 minutes before I relaized it was not moving.  I don't know if the front car was broken down or if it was just some idiot fishing for loose change.  Either way it was frustrating.  I ended up at a kiosk at the exit and using a card to pay.  A card a put in the direction indicated by the picture on the machine.  It was the wrong way.  A quick turn around and my aunt and I were finally off.  

I much prefer to be a passenger at McCarran.  That is the way to go."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"To cut to the chase, I give Buddha Belly Deli a solid five stars for service and four stars for the food.

Five stars - Service here is top notch. The guys are friendly and attentive.  My food and drink were delivered to me in about the same amount of time it took me to eat my meal. For me, that can be on the fast side. I was also brought three different house made sauces and told what each is. In fact, I was told about a few bits of information about the food. Like what is the seasoning on the chips. Or what comes on the dragon breath fries. See below for details. I was offered a couple of refills of my tea. And I was stopped when I tried to clear my own table. It seemed as though I was eating and a casual dining sit-down sort of restaurant but it looks like a fast food place. It was really a pleasent dining experience. You can tell the guys behind the counter are enjoying what they do and care for the customers. That kind of subtle attitude goes a long way.

Four stars - today, on my first visit to the Buddha Belly Deli, I ordered a Katsu Chicken Club sandwich, a side of Dragon Breath Fries and a tropical green tea. The prices seemed high at first but upon seeing the portions, I was swayed. 
°The sandwich came with two perfectly crisp pieces of Katsu Chicken, thick cut and perfectly cooked strips of bacon, shredded lettuce and a tomato slice. There was also some Asian BBQ sauce on the bun. Over all, a tasty sandwich to be sure. I could have gone for a bit more BBQ sauce though. To my final bite I added a dab of the special kimche (?) ketchup that came with the Dragon Breath Fries. Also a house made pickle chip that came on the side. With those two added to the crisp chicken, perfection. 
°The chips on the side were obviously house made which should be a nice touch. But honestly, I don't care much for chips whether fresh or mass produced. What I did like was the seasoning. I guessed the seaweed, salt and pepper. I asked to comfirm this and was informed there is sugar on them too.  The chip seasoning would be great on some fries, IMO. 
°As for the side of Dragon Breath Fries, appropriately named. It is two hours later as I write this and I can still taste the garlic. These little shoe strings were covered in garlic and Thai peppers and totally delicious. Dipped in the ketchup there were even better. 
°Finally the house made sauces. I was brought three different sauces of varied intensity. The first was a Thai chili sauce. It has a good medium heat with a nice peppery flavor. There was a green pepper sauce that was my favorite. Not too hot with a bit of a tart tomatillo note. I used this on the chips more than any other sauce. The third and final sauce, actually the first I tried and the last I used before leaving, was a ghost chili sauce. It is deceptively sweet and fruity up front. Then the heat hits you as you swallow. It reminds me of habanero peppers. Good but only in limited quantities for me.

Its a good thing Buddha Belly Deli is not closer to home. I would be too tempted to spend all of my hard earned money on sandwiches and maybe even the smothered fries. I have yet to try those. Maybe next time."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"John's Incredible Pizza Co. is almost a unique place.  I can best describe it as Chuck E. Cheese's meets Cici's Pizza.  Though John's takes the best ideas of each and improves upon them.  

The Chuck E. Cheese aspect is in the arcade section in the back of John's.  There are standard arcade games like the type that you shoot aliens or fly hover cars around a race track.  There are further arcade game still.  The type that give you tickets for your winnings.  But these are all updated games new(ish) to the 21st century.  I believe I saw such current obsessions like Angry Birds.  If it is not enough to have built upon the gaming aspect of Chuck E. Cheese, John's has added rides like bumper cars and some sort of dizzying spin ride.  They also have a miniature bowling alley and a half hole (9 hole) black light mini golf course.  Taking a page from Dave and Buster's, John's has token cards for all their games and attractions rather than physical coinage.  There is a lot going on here.  It would have been more entertaining if all the various games were functional.  Many weren't which was disappointing.  It was also kind of hot in there given all the people running around and all the arcade games bleeding the local power grid dry.

The Cici's Pizza idea of a pizza buffet is amplified here.  The salad bar has options to choose from both in full salad fixings and dressings.  It is a standard buffet salad bar but a noticeable and appreciated improvement over Cici's.  Some with the pizza.  There are more varieties and better quality pizzas at John's.  I wasn't so sure about it going in but I was impressed.  It isn't the best pizza I've had but also far from the worst.  The food doesn't end here either.  There are several pasta selections.  All pasta is undressed allowing for you the customer to customize your meal by combining one of the many pastas with one of the many sauces.  If Italian food isn't your first choice, there is also fried chicken, mashed potatoes and a few different soups to try.  For dessert, if the crowd has not totally decimated the selection, there is a peaches and cream dessert, fresh baked chocolate chips cookies, cinnamon rolls, and my personal favorite, fresh fried doughnuts which you can watch them make.  Not a bad selection.

There are many different themed rooms for you and your party to be seated in. My group was in the Kaleidoscope room towards the front.  There is a log cabin theme room, a Disney room and some private party rooms.  Probably more that I didn't get to see.  

If you chose to come to John's, be prepared to park a ways away.  And be prepared for a crowd.  This is at the Boulevard Mall and people come in droves.  You'll see families, parents and kids, running wild between the dining rooms, the buffet and the arcade.  It is a zoo akin to an amusement park.  It can be pretty fun especially for kids.  For a guy like me who would rather not be around kids, its a little too much to handle.  I was only there for a nephew's birthday.  I don't think I will make a habit of going but only because it is not a place for me.  For families, you can get some good hours of entertainment and some good food for a fair price."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I went to Carowinds based on a dream.  Many months before I had seen it on Travel Channels ""Bert The Conqueror.""  More specifically I saw the Intimidator roller coaster.  I used to be a coaster buff and I am still a Dale Earnhardt fan.  When I saw that ride and rode it online through a POV video, I knew I had to go.  So my trip to Charlotte was planned and ten months later I was there.  

Carowinds is owned, at this time, by Cedar Fair company that owns Cedar Point and Knotts Berry Farm (a park I grew up at).  So I kind of knew what to expect.  The price was good for a park with so many rides.  $39.99 is about as cheap as you will find.  There will be pleanty of Snoopy and other Peanuts characters to go around.  This is all standard for a Cedar Fair park.  And like other Cedar Fair parks, this has a bit of everything for everybody.   There are classic wooden coasters.  There are steel multi-element coasters.  Water rides.  Kiddie coasters.  An observation tower.  I think I even saw a classic dark ride.  For the price, this park is hard to beat.  For me though, it is hard to survive.

My first ride on a cloudy and slightly drizzly morning was on Intimidator.  I had to ride it before I was intimidated by it.  The line was short and I was on my way up the very steep lift hill in under ten minutes.  The seats were unique first in their layout second in their design.  My feet were not touching the floor of the train.  There were no handles to hold on to.  I basically was free falling the entire ride.  It was intense but oh so fun.  It was remarkably smooth.  Insanely fast.  The air time is unmatched in my book.  I loved all three minutes of it.  Afterwards I was not so happy.  I don't deal with rides as well as I used to.  I was dizzy for a good hour.  During that hour I basically walked around the park trying to regain my composure.  All this running around made me thirsty.  I struggled though to find a drink.  Most of the food/drink stands were closed still.  I ended up with a bottle of Sprite from a machine for a handful of dollars.  A lot for 20 oz. of sugar water but expected from a park.  

Once I was feeling ready again I started riding more.  I went for a trip on Thunder Road, a classic out and back racing wooden coaster.  It was a lot of fun despite being a tight squeeze for my frame.  Next up was a good classic water flume.  I was drenched.  I loved it.  I wanted to ride another wooden coaster but it was closed.  I wanted to ride a raft ride but it was closed.  I ended up at Thunder Road again where I got shaken to the core on my second ride.  This effectively ended my day.  I was only in the park for just more than two hours.  Money well spent?  Sure.  For Intimidator it was.  I have decided though that I am done with parks.  Thank you, Carowinds for saving me money and time.  

Carowinds is fun.  It is a little small compared to some parks I have been to.  There is a lot for everybody.  Just not for me.  Check it out if you are in the area.  It is a unique place in that it is the only park in the nation that is in two states (NC and SC).  Some of the rides even cross that border.  Quite interesting if you are into that kind of trivia."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I came to Don Michael's the other night after finding it almost by accident.  I was driving around trying to figure out what to do for dinner when I stopped in to the shopping center at Decatur and Lone Mountain.  I knew about Baladie Cafe and gave that a thought.  Then I remembered I was less than thrilled last time.  I seemed to recall a Roberto's Taco Shop here too.  It is something else now.  As I was getting ready to drive away from this little void of disappointment, I noticed a flimsy sign in the corner reading ""Don Michael's.""  This is new to me so I figure I'll check it out.

When I walked in a bit after 5:00 PM, I was the only patron in the entire restaurant.  I saw a table reserved for about an hour out.  That was it.  I was greeted and seated almost immediately by a very friendly hostess/server.  She took a minute to go over the days specials and gave me a moment to review the menu, such as it is.  It isn't much of a menu.  A couple pages of light weight office paper bound between two sheets of plastic with a plastic spine.  Not unlike what all of my Jr High reports were placed in.  No matter though.  It all adds to the overall feel of home.

I settled upon one of the two daily specials, egg plant rollotini (the other being egg plant parm).  I opted to pay a little more for a cup of Italian Wedding Soup rather than the complimentary salad.  Before I knew it I had a cup of soup and a basket of garlic toast.  There is nothing special about the garlic toast.  Its crispy.  Its buttery.  Its average.  The soup was almost a upsetting.  I could hear the ""ding"" of a microwave just before it was brought out and the shredded chicken in the soup was tough like it had been microwaved.  However, the broth was good.  Maybe not as clear as in other versions I've had. The meatballs were absolutely stunning.  I made a point to tell the hostess.  I don't know what they are made of but, damn, they were the best little meatballs I've had.  All is forgiven on the microwave front.  My main course, egg plant rollotini, was crazy good.  Thinly sliced egg plant floured and fried then rolled and stuffed with ricotta cheese.  It was like manicotti but with egg plant rather than pasta.  Brilliant! On the side was a bowl of penne done perfectly al dente with just a little bit of sauce.  Perfect for a guy like me who does not care for swimming pasta.  I took home some left overs and the pasta maintained its integrity.  The perfect Saturday breakfast.

Before I finished my meal some other guests arrived.  An older couple at first.  They sat down and ordered right away.  I could tell they were regulars.  Especially when I ordered a glass of wine and was told which varieties they had avialable and which one they would not serve me as the lady at the other table would be drinking that.  I had a cabernet.  There was another small group coming in as I left.

It was fun for me to hear the banter of the staff at Don Michael's.  Banter with each other.  Banter with the guests.  All in a dining room that feels like it could be anybody's home.  Ceiling fans.  Little curtains over the windows like any good old fashioned kitchen would have.  Italian American jazz crooners on the play list.  Olive Garden may treat you like family but this place feels like home."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"Do you like the sound of horse power? Do you go crazy for the smell of petroleum? Do you live for the wind in your face? If yes, you may ride a motorcycle. If you don't but you've always wanted a taste of the wild side of life perhaps you should check out Vegas Trike Adventures.

Vegas Trike Adventures offers a couple of different tours. Today I took the Hoover Dam tour. Though I am local and could have driven to meet the tour group in Boulder City I chose to pick up the bus at the Tropicana. Other stops for more riders included Bally's and the Golden Nugget. Tropicana was the first on the schedule. The bus (very large van) was a few minutes late but not too bad. What made us most late to the party was the traffic approaching Rail Road Pass. Damn construction delays.

When we made it to Boulder City we stopped at the Albertsons for a restroom and snack break. Then we boarded the van once again and drove around the back to find our chariots waiting for us. 

Next on the agenda was a crash course (or how not to crash course) on how to operate these mighty beasts. By which I mean either a 150cc or 300cc Ice Bear motor trike. They are fairly simple. After our safety breifing we were asked to mount our steeds and practice setting and realeasing the brakes and starting/stopping the motor. This was followed by several minutes of figure-8's to familiarize ourselves with the handling capabilities, the power and the braking. From there we hit the open road.

We headed down Highway 93 single file right and tight all the way to the Hoover Dam security post and eventually to Arizona to park and look down upon the engineering marvel that is Hoover Dam. The ride there saw us going as slow as 25 MPH and as fast as 50 MPH. It was all very exciting for somebody like me who is more accustomed to four wheel enclosed modes of transportation. We were given some history of the dam and surrounding areas before departing.

After our brief stay at the dam we headed back towards Boulder City making a stop at the Lake Mead overlook. We were given some information about the lake such as how long it has been since it was at capacity. We didn't stay here for long as there was a second group waiting for the trikes back in Boulder City. We were on the road again.

Maybe a mile or so from base camp my trike started sputtering. I thought it was going to stall. I pulled off to the side of the road as did the one trike behind me and the chase van. But the trike kept going like the Little Engine That Could. I think I can. I think I can. I think I can. And I did. I made it back as did the rest of the group. There was a bit of a hiccup with a rider a few trikes ahead of me. We were pulling through a gated area to park and the gate closed on him. It missed his leg but hit the trike hard. A little bit of a scary moment but everybody was safe

After a quick debreifing and waiting for a new bus, a more proper bus, to pick us up we headed back to Las Vegas. Tropicana was first up again as it was in the morning. I was first off the bus and on my way home by 3:10 PM. I was picked up at 9:00 AM. Pretty much an all day adventure. Most of the time was not spent riding but I was paying for the full experience. Down time and bus rides included. Not a bad way to spend a day away from the city life."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"Had I paid full price for this buffet I would have been horribly disappointed.  Having paid half price with a friend and a coupon,  I am still disappointed but much less so. 

Some of the food here I rather liked.  There was a stroganoff dish that was rich and creamy with the goat cheese in it.  And being loaded with mushrooms is never a bad thing.  Maybe it was on the salty side but other than that, it was pretty good.  There was a vanilla infused beet salad that was almost like a dessert.  I do like a good beet salad so this was a treat.  There was some Thai green curry that had some good flavor going on.  Coconut up front.  Curry spice on the back.  I just wish there was more beef.  I think my favorite from the serving line was a little smoked sausage with a nice snap.

My main complaint here is the freshness of the food.  Some of what I tried was really quite dried out.  The gnocchi with bolognese had almost no sauce left having been sucked up by the gnocchi which were then dried.  The shephards pies were mostly all burnt on top.  I had to look for one that at least still looked like mashed potatoes on top.  There was an Asian chicken dish that seemed moist but had so much skin and fat that after I pushed it aside I was left with little actual meat.  I did not care for the bone marrow.  That is more of a personal taste thing than it is a knock against this establishment.  I had never had marrow and was not expecting the gelatinous nature of it.  At least I tried it.  For people who are into that sort of food, they serve it here.  Enjoy.

Dessert looked great.  And for the most part it was all pretty good.  But again it seemed like it all was sitting out a while.  The mouse cakes were spongy and chewey. So was the banana macaron.  The chocolate covered strawberry was under ripe but still good.  My favorite dessert of the night was a pistachio cream eclair.  That was an interesting little take on one of my favorite of any desserts.  I only wish it was bigger that my little finger.

Unfortunately I was not able to sample all the food here.  I have a shell fish allergy and shell fish happens to make up a large percentage of the offerings at Wicked Spoon.  The crab legs looked average and smelled fresh.  I hear the shrimp balls were good and my eyes would back that up.

I am not used to this type of high end dining on the Strip.  I am more of a ""support your local Station Casinos"" kind of guy.  The small plates at Wicked Spoon that then receive smaller plates with yet smaller food is a turn off.  With some fancy foot work and putting my old Tetris skills to work I was able to fit maybe four or five foods on my plate at a time.  I prefer where I can just dump a spoon of this and a spoon of that and have half the offerings in one go.  Trying to place plates on plates just seems a waste of dishes.  Job security for the folks in the back I guess. And then there are the wine bottles, water bottles and drink menus on each small table making for little space to put all of your plates once you are done with them.  There is even less space when the bussing staff does not remove your used dishes by the time you get back with your next round of stacked servings.  I like the idea Wicked Spoon is going for here.  But at nearly $40 per person, I would like to see the execution improve."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I first heard of Guamanian food from Diners Drive-ins and Dives. It looked good so I looked to Yelp to see if there were any Guamanian restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. That led me to Red Rice.

Being unfamiliar with Guamanian food I did not know what to order. The gentleman taking my order was good enough to guide me through by showing me the Hafa Adai plate. BBQ chicken, a pork spare rib, chicken kelaguen, cucumber fina denne, an empanada and red rice. I've said it before but it is worth repeating, if you don't know what to order order it all. That is what I did with the Hafa Adai plate.

It took about 15 minutes to get my food today. It was brought to my table in a styrofoam clamshell box as if to go. This is standard at Red Rice. I opened it up and was greeted by much more food than I had expected. The front compartment was packed full of dense red rice which was topped with the BBQ chicken, empanada and spare rib. The back two smaller compartments had the cucumbers and chicken kelaguen. 

I tried the BBQ chicken first. I was so pleased to taste the smoky char right up front. I've had a lot of similar BBQ chicken from Hawaiian places that just came up short. This was delicious and probably my favorite piece of this Guamanian puzzle. Next I tried the kelaguen. I was confused by it at first. Grilled chicken chopped small, mixed with green onion and served cold. It was insanely herbatious with a sour note in the background and a little spice. I wasn't sure if I was enjoying it at first but the more I ate the more I enjoyed. The rib was next. I don't typically like ribs but this was good. Not fall-off-the-bone tender but not difficult to pull off the bone with a little tug. It had the same char foward flavor as the chicken. Not a bad thing. As far as ribs go, I'd eat that again. The cucumbers were cold and crisp. Quite refreshing. I'm not sure what the dressing was but it was a little salty. Soy sauce and rice vinegar maybe? The empanada was sadly my least favorite item today. I don't know what it was stuffed with. I couldn't quite place it. The shell was over cooked. It was very crunchy and dry like a taco shell. I used the dipping sauce for the meats (soy sauce and vinegar like pot sticker sauce) to moisten the breading. That helped. Finally, the red rice. The restaurants name sake. It is cooked with achiote which gives it the red color. One could almost mistake the rice for Spanish style given the color and even the taste to an extent. But this rice is different. It has a very earthy quality. A natural sweet nutty taste. I eat a lot of rice and I've had some good variations. This was wholly unique and now one of my favorites.

I was told before I ordered that Guamanian food was similar to Hawaiian and Filipino food. I was told that some people say it is a fusion of the two. I was told it was just simply ""Guam food."" Having now tried it, I understand. There are some similarities but all the islands from which the comparisons draw are in the same ocean. Similarities are bound to occur. This is a different kind of food. And in the Las Vegas Valley it is coming from this little restaurant on Eastern. It is served by a friendly staff who tells you about the food and talks to you about you. Like a neighborhood joint in a very large neighborhood. I'll be coming back for sure."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I went in for a full Brazilian today. Wait, wrong place ;) I went for the full Rodizio. Yeah, that's right. I came to Rodizio Grill at the Gallery Mall for lunch and ordered the full Rodizio which includes all the meat you can eat, side dishes and a salad bar. That's where they get you. You fill up on salad and sides and then you don't eat so much meat. It's sneaky but I'm on to them. 

In all honesty, though, it is a good salad bar. There are a ton of items. All of which are very fresh. My favorite item was a simple topping of aged parmesan shavings. That pairs well with the Ceasar dressing I used which was also outstanding. A good Ceasar is made with anchovies. I could taste that here. Bonus. I also appreciate that they offer hearts of palm. You don't often see that at your average salad bar. Double bonus.

The sides I tried were fine. I went very sparingly on those though. I tried a piece of fried polenta. Crispy and light as a good French fry would be. I also had a piece of caramelized banana. Not bad. Lightly sweet and just a little crisp. There were more choices but I wanted to leave room for the meats.

I tried about everything that came out today. Some of the meats I liked more than others. I was absolutely thrilled with the ham with its crackling glaze and tender texture. Up there in the same realm was the linguica sausage, the sweet and spicy chicken, the pork with parmesan, and a couple of the beef offerings. The ones that were more on the rare to medium side. I wish I knew what everything was so I could be more specific. Some of the items I liked well enough but weren't exactly my favorites are the pineapple, the more well done beef cuts and the marinated chicken. The tri-tip was too well done for my liking but had nice flavor. There were only two items I tried that I did not enjoy. The chicken hearts and pork rib. And that is entirely a matter of personal taste more than it is a reflection on the establishment and quality of the food. The chicken hearts, as advertised, are of a different texture. One that it turns out I don't enjoy. But I always wanted to try them and now I have. The pork rib was just too porky for me. I'm not a big pork fan and I should have just said ""no thank you."" But like they say, ""when in Rio...""

Just when I thought I had enough, I ordered dessert. I was offered cheese cake, chocolate torte, flan, creme brulee and rabanada. I had never tried rabanada before and the others, while delicious, are more or less standard. So I ordered the rabanada. They make it fresh to order so it took a few minutes to come out. These little pastries reminded me of over sized under cooked churros. They were wonderful. The cinnamon and sugar. The crispy exterior. The gooey interior. Even the vanilla ice cream on the side. What a treat.

When all was said and done, the staff here is super friendly. They are attentive and never let my plate go empty. This was a very good Friday lunch experience in a mostly empty restaurant. It was early (11:30 AM). I am ever so slightly disappointed that there were no lamb offerings and the bacon wrapped chicken never made it to me. But did I really need those? No. I had more than enough. This is not one of those places to come to frequently. That would be downright unhealthy.  But for those special occassions or when you just want a good meat feast, this is where you want to go."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"Forte has been on my radar for years.  Ever since I saw it on ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.""  I don't know why it took me so long to get here but I finally did the other night.  And now I am kicking myself for not making it in sooner because it is so good.  From the food to the friendly hospitality asking me how the food was, how my beer was, if I needed more ice for my water.  This was well worth the visit, long as it may have taken me to get around to.

I had a wonderful meal sitting alone in the back corner of the dining room observing all the art work and people spread throughout the establishment.  It wasn't overly busy on a Tuesday evening around 5:30 but there were a few groups of people.  One small group outside, a small group inside, a larger group a little closer to where I sat, and a couple.  I could not tell if they all could hear the music playing or if they were even paying attention to it but I can tell you that I was rocking out.  I sat almost directly below the speaker.  I closed my eyes and was suddenly transported to an Eastern European night club (think ""Eurotrip"").  I half expected to hear ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" at any moment.  I'm not always into dance hall type music but in this case, it was fitting.

My meal started with the complimentary bread basket with a saucer of olive oil sprinkled with the spice blend sitting on each table.  I know there was a little bit of salt in the blend.  Beyond that, I am at a loss.  It was good though and that is all that matters.  

Next up on my tour of the menu was a Bulgarian beer, Zakorga, which came with a complimentary meat plate.  On this plate was four pieces of cured meat similar to salami in appearance, two gerkins and an olive complete with pit.  The meat was not as salty or spicy as salami.  Rather it was the sweet nuttyness of a natural dry cured meat almost like a prosciutto.  What a perfect accompaniment to a beer.    

To start my actual meal, I ordered stuffed grape leaves and beef stroganoff ragu.

The grape leaves are meat stuffed and served hot with a rich yogurt sauce topped with fresh dill and parsley.  There was a wedge of lemon on the side.  A quick spritz of juice over the leaves really rounded out the plate.  The vibrant acidity cut through the richness of the yogurt nicely.  

The stroganoff that came up next was also very rich.  It was a ground beef strognaoff in a full bodied sour cream sauce served over wild mushroom pelmeni (dumplings).  It was very good on its own but, in hindsight, the spice blend next to me would have been a fitting addition. 

What meal is complete without dessert? I was considering the baklava but after hearing the Bulgarian Biscuit Cake described to me, I knew that was my dessert.  I was told it is made with a type of cake that cannot be found anywhere else in the valley.  And that it was layered with a cream filling like tiramisu, one of my favorite desserts.  How could I even think about passing this up?  I was surprised by the size of this cake.  It was bigger than I expected but not as rich I as thought it may be.  The cake used seemed more like a bread which helped to cut down the sweetness.  With the almost but not quite bitter dark chocolate sauce on top, it was balanced out to perfection and was the best possible way to end my meal.  I left with a soft smile on my face that only ended later when I was at home and the euphoria wore off."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"Part biker bar. Part hotrodders bar. Part rock bar. Count's Vamp'd is not a bad place for somebody like me. A 30 something man who likes cars, loves rock-n-roll music and enjoys the occassional cute bar tender girl who call you ""sweetie."" I'm sure she's just flirting for tips but what the hell. Its nice regardless. Just don't think this would be a good place for a date night. You wont be able to hear each other over the music. Maybe you're into this.

This is not a bar for everybody though. The first time I came here was with some family. My grandma did not enjoy it as my uncle and I did. The rock music can get loud and she has no interest in cars and bikes. My uncle was a biker. He rode a nice Harley 1200 CC. This place was right up his alley. And we were able to get a nice beer. There are several on tap and even more in the bottle. You shouldn't have any issue finding a beer if that is what you are into. But they have a full bar for those who want something more. My grandma was talked into a Cadillac margarita (?) and did not enjoy it. She sent it back and got a Bud Light instead. She is old fashioned that way.

On my second visit to Count's I came in for lunch. And a beer. Lets not forget the beer. I was the only one in the entire restaurant as they had just opened a few minutes earlier. I eat early. So I found a seat in the bar area and ordered a Newcastle to start. When my beer came to the table I asked about the lunch specials. It sounded like they only have a cheese burger, a patty melt, and a turkey club. Not too much to chose from and not listed on the menu. No matter. A cheese burger sounded like it would accompany a beer nicely. It was a burger. I was decidedly unimpressed at first. The meat looked fine but the toppings were slim. Lettuce, tomato, onion and a couple pickle slices. Pretty standard. The taste, however, was awesome. The meat tasted very fresh and truly flame grilled. It was cooked to medium exactly how I requested. The cheddar cheese, one of three or four cheeses to chose from, was melted completely. It was a nice departure from the typical American pseudocheese you get at fast food places. The rest of the skimpy toppings, which I decided about half way through are little more than filler anyhow, were just right on this burger. Too many toppings lead to messy hard to eat burgers. This was just right. I finished my lunch decidely satisfied. That is satisfied with the food.

Service was not entirely bad. Like I already mentioned, the cute bar tender/waitress called me sweetie. Repeatedly. She was friendly enough though not all too present. She brought my beer, my food and my bill without me having to wait long for anything but she never really came by to check on me. She did ask a couple of times if I wanted another beer. Most of the time I was in there she was talking to the other girl working that morning. The other one came by once to ask if I needed anything. What upset me the most was when I was asked to move to another table when I was in the middle of eating my burger. Apparently there was a light above the table I was at that needed changed. Moving was just an inconvenience. I was irritated when the guy came over and sat a bottle of window cleaner and a rag on the table right as I took a bite. When he asked me to move I said I would as long as he didn't ask me to clean. I let it go but honestly, thats not right. That burned out bulb could have waited for me to finish my meal."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"SlotZilla is finally fully operational! Today is only day two of being open to the public and I was first in line (for the zoomline). I actually bought my ticket to the upper zoomline last night. I have been waiting for this since the idea was announced years ago. How could I not be excited at the opportunity to ride. The thought of flying like Superman down the entire length of the Fremont Street Experience is too great a thrill to avoid. 

I arrived at 11:00 AM knowing my flight time was not until noon. But they say you have to check in at least 15 minutes prior and I was not sure how long the line would be since today is Labor Day. It turns out I was very early and nobody else was around to form a line. That makes no difference to me. I was right up front and ready to go. I even got to assist the staff by moving the ribbon blockade out of the way ready to usher todays guest up the stairs. Again, I was first up and first on the scale. Then on to another line to get suited up and ready to go. Here is where the waiting began.

I watched the elevator go up and come down a couple of times with staff and gear. Then it became a game of hurry up and wait. They weren't ready for the ""fliers"" yet. I was getting very hot in the full body harness with no air flow. Finally the moment arrived as did the elevator. My ascent to the top of the world had begun. Or at least to the launch deck of a very big slot machine. Our chariot was in the form of an open air elevator a la construction crane. It provided some nice views of East Vegas and South to the airport. Nice views but short lived.

I was one of the first riders to the lift table along with two women. We were told to lay on the table and were then lifted to the cable ready to be connected. A few tugs here and there and the table began to lower, the harness now supporting my full weight. A couple more last minute adjustments to the straps and we were all ready to go. The front gate lowered and my heart began to race. Then much to my surprise, absolutely nothing happened. Apparently the system was not ready or not resetting. The door was raised back up as were the tables. This was a welcome adendum to the delay. Hanging in the harness was not nearly as comfortable as lying on the table. Another several minutes later the system was fully reset and we were off.

Starting at 108 feet up, riders are higher than the canopy of the Fremont Street Experience. You lose sight of the cables and it looks as though you will crash right into the light display. But alas, you glide gently beneath while racing along at over 35 MPH. Looking down I could see tourist, show girls and street performers all looking up in amazement. ""Its a bird. Its a plane. Its a fat man"" is what I imagine they were saying as I passed by faster than a speeding gnat. Before too long I reached the end of the line and crashed hard into the break run. I was pulled into the landing platform where a second table raised up to meet me and I was made detached from the line. A quick photo  opportunity and the removal of the harness and my experience was over. 

This was the most fun and thrilling activity I have participated in in the last couple of years. $40 is a bit much given the duration of the ride but for the technology, the equipment and the staff, I suppose it is a necessary evil. My hope is that they get the bugs worked out soon to get the lines flowing more smoothly. Also, better training for the staff would not be a bad idea. They have fun joking around with each other but almost to the point of being unprofessional. That being said, never once did I feel unsafe. Just excited."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"A little self-endulgence is encouraged from time to time, right?  Well last night I went all out at Harvest by Roy Ellamar.  I put on my nicest and newest polo shirt, a sweet pair of slacks and prepared for a fancy feast (not the cat food).  

I had a reservation for 6:00 PM and arrived a bit early. I sat for a while in the passage way before going in. About 5:40 I went up to the hostess, mentioned my reservation and was seated immediately even though I was a little early. I was brought three menues upon sitting down. One for wine, one for cocktails and one for food. I brushed aside the cocktails listing and went for the wines. I decided on a nice glass of pinot noir.  I love a good dry red.  Choosing my wine was the easy part. Dinner on the other hand, I had an idea but I just wasn't set yet. After silently debating for a moment or two, I ordered a 12 oz ribeye cooked to medium and for a couple of sides, potatoes gratin and spinach. Then I was asked if I wanted an appetizer to get me started.  Really? You want me to eat more? Well, OK. I ordered the grilled asparagus with creme fresh.  My starter, the wine and the complimentary breads with raita came out quite quickly.  

What also came quick was a food cart from a special guest chef.  I'm sorry I don't remember his name or his restaurant.  Apparently, though, he was part of a special once monthly (?) event where a guest chef showcases some of his/her creations.  My options on this cart were ahi poke, salmon poke, lobster pot pie and roasted oysters with Meyers Lemon butter and bread crumbs. Process of elimination (no shell fish or raw fish for Jared) led me to try the oysters.  They were good but not particularly memorable.  Mind you I'm not exactly an oyster aficionado so take that summation with a pearl of salt.

As for the rest of my meal, lets begin with the asparagus.  I am a fan of the king of the vegetables.  It can be fibrous and it can be bitter.  This was both and it was great.  With the creme fresh and the minced shallots on top, asparagas was the perfect way to begin my meal.  My steak and sides came out a few minutes after I finished my asparagus.  The steak cooked to a perfect medium as I requested.  Impossibly tender and topped with a little herbed butter, this was a decadent cut of beef.  To push it over the top, it came with two sauces for dipping.  A buttery and velvety bearnaise and a red wine sauce.  Both were fantastic and it is difficult to choose a favorite.  I do feel the bearnaise complimented the buttery steak better than the wine sauce.  The sides I ordered were the best possible accompaniment for my steak.  The potatoes gratin were like chunky mashed potatoes topped with cheese and placed under the broiler for just a few minutes to brown.  My first bite was met with audible approval.  A sound I'm not sure how to express in text.  The spinach, while amazing and full of flavor, was not quite as awe inspiring as the potatoes.  There was a slightly sweet Asian flavor.  Vietnamese caramel it turns out.  Topped with fried red chilies, this spinach was well balanced and went down easily.  

Before I knew it, my entire dinner was gone and I was left with a few sips of wine.  A wine which paired well with the steak, by the way.  Just when I thought I was done, the dessert cart came around.  There were so many enticing options to choose from.  I settled for something small that would go with the wine as the steak had.  I chose a chocolate bonbon.  A hard dark chocolate shell with a creamy milk chocolate center.  It was a rich final bite.  A last sip of wine to cleanse my palate and I was through.

Delicious farm fresh food offerings.  Top notch service at every turn.  A gorgeous kitchen which can be seen from many areas of the restaurant.  Harvest is an incredible place to dine and have an experience set apart from the labors of daily life if even for just an hour."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I suppose you could look at my visit to R Burgers as a comedy of errors. It started on Nevada Day when I thought I'd stop for lunch. Yeah, nice try. The parking lot was packed. Packed as in zero places to park. And the drive-thru had at least 6 cars already. No thank you.

I came back the next day and earlier to try and beat the crowd. Yeah, another nice try. The parking lot had spaces this time so I parked and went in. Much to my surprise the place was pretty well busy. A little league team had settled in and were enjoying what I assume was a post-game treat. Usually a restaurant full of children would be a deterent for me but they seemed well behaved enough. I decided to stay. For a few minutes that is. As I waited behind the one customer in line ahead of me to order (she took way too long), I heard the most hideous ear splitting sound arise behind me. It was the cackling cacophony of the mother of one of the little league'rs. Her body heaving with ever boistrous laugh. That was the deal breaker. I will not subject myself to that kind of torture for a burger. I went back to my car to pitch a fit. Strike one.

As I sat in my car contemplating why I live in a city full of people why never cease to irritate me, I noticed the drive-thru was clear. I can take my burger home. It wont be as fresh but it could work. My order was taken right away and I moved up to the window. Thats where I sat for several minutes before anybody even took my money. Then I waited another several minutes before I was given my food. All total, maybe 10 minutes waiting for my food with the sun beating down on me through my windshield. This food better be worth it!

When I was given my bag of food I was surprised at the weight. This is a surely a good sign, right? If the weight to cost ($10+) ratio is any indication then this is a nice value. Unfortunately disappointment set in before even leaving the parking lot. Yes, the food was plentiful just not that good.

The first few fries I had were over cooked. They were not burnt but were a dark golden brown. They were crispy on the outside which is fine but the crisp went all the way through. A frie of this caliber should be lightly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. These were like eating frie shaped potato chips. I hoped they would get better as I ate more and a few were pretty good. The majority, though, were just as dried out and over cooked as the rest. It is a damn shame because the seasoning they use is really good. Salty and a little sweet. They could be supurb but just fell short. I didn't even finish them. Strike 2. I hope the burger is better.

It took me maybe 20 minutes to get home so my burger was not as fresh as it could have been. With that taken into account, my burger still wasn't fabulous. Better than the fries were for sure. There was a lot going for this burger. It was a big burger which, for the price, was a reliefe. It had a nice fresh flavor. The tomato and onion were of a good quality. The shredded romaine lettuce was a little strange. I'm used to iceberg. The avocado was awesome but then I am a sucker for fresh avocado. And the bacon, suffering from the same fate as the fries, was overcooked. It was hard rather than crisp and actually hurt my teeth. As for the bun, the top bun was alright. A little firm and chewy but it held up nicely to the saucey burger. The bottom bun seemed dried out and hard. And finally the hamburger patty. It was great! Very fresh and high quality taste. I wish everything else had been up to that level.

I want to like R Burgers. I really do. I can see they have good potential. Maybe I caught them on an off day. They seem to be popular and seem to get mostly solid reviews. That simply was not my experience. They swung for the fences but just could not get that homerun. They didn't strike out but the count was full and they still got on base. They game goes on."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I would never have known to look for Egyptian food in Las Vegas until I heard of POTs from a coworker yesterday. I came home and started researching and today I showed up for lunch. 

Now I am by no means a vegitarian or vegan. In fact I have made fun of my vegan cousins in the past. But that does not mean I am opposed to eating a vegitarian meal now and again. That is what you'll find and POTs. No meat here. No problem though. I had enough food that as I am writing this review about 6 hours later I am just now starting to feel hungry again. It was a delicious meat free meal that I am about to discuss in its entirety.

First, I was greeted warmly and asked if I had been there before. I had not so she was gracious enough to describe some of the food. She recommended the cauliflower shawarma. I accepted. Then she told me about the sauce options. I went with spicy tahini. Next I ordered the Egyptian fries for a side and dried apricot mahlabeya for dessert. She broke down the pronounciation of that last word and had me repeat it back to her. I think I did ok but don't ask me to say it again without some help. It put a smile on my face though. When I came back to ordering I needed a drink. She suggested the karkadeh. Again, I accepted. She did not steer me wrong on anything. I had a seat and maybe a little more than 5 minutes later the first parts of my food came to the table. 

The karkadeh, or hibiscus tea, was about half gone within seconds of being placed on the table. What can I say, I was thirsty. Its tart and lightly sweet. I would dare say even a bit tropical. Very refreshing.

The Egyptian fries with house made ketchup were next. Steak cut fries with special Egyptian seasoning I cannot quite identify but I appreciated nonetheless. They were screaming hot, crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. The way a perfect fry should be. And the ketchup was absurdly good. Better than any other ketchup I've had anywhere. It wasn't enough for such a large order of fries. I was offered more but declined because, while it is delicious and perfect for the fries, it is not really needed. The fries are good on their own.

Before I finished with the fries my cauliflower shawarma came out. Roasted cauliflower was nestled in a bed of arugala and topped with tomato, cucumber and spicy tahini all stuffed in a flat bread. It was superb. Cauliflower is one of my favorite vegetables so this was a treat indeed. The large pieces were a perfect subsitute for the meat I would ordinarily be missing. The arugala is a nice bitter component in this sandwich. The tomato and cucumber is refreshing. And the spicy tahini is a great dressing to add a certain richness and tie it all together. It was not too spicy but had just enough kick to let you know its there. Well balanced. 

Finally came dessert. By now I was getting full. But, as they say, there's always room for jello. Or pudding as it turns out. A dried apricot pudding atop a coconut pudding to be exact. I could see the one dried apricot and coconut flakes on top but was surprised to find the dried fruit mixed in to the puddings. While I've never had a pudding such as this before it sort of took me back to me childhood. I grew up eating fresh apricots fresh off the trees in my back yard. To taste the distinct flavor again was a win in my book. A perfect ending.

I very much enjoyed my lunch today. I very much appreciated the hospitality I felt. And I very much want to try more food. I would like to make my way through the rest of the menu. It is not a massive selection but there is enough to keep you guessing a while. But to echo some other reviews, POTs can get a bit pricey. My meal today cost me $31 including tip. Kind of high for a place that is somewhere between fast food and casual dining. It would be more realistic for me to order one item as a quick lunch rather than a full meal complete with sides and desserts on my future visits. POTs is just close enough to work to be convenient from time to time so those future visits are very possible."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"It pains me to give Aviation Nation only a 3.5 (4)-Star rating today but given my experience of this first air show at Nellis AFB since the government sequester of 2013, I have to do what is right. What is right is to let the people know what is up. 

First of all, parking was at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway as it always is. I followed the traffic from I-15 down Speedway Blvd and went to where the military personnel directed me. Where they directed me was towards the ADA bus stop which I was then informed I could not use as I am not disabled. Instead I was told to use the busses on the opposite and far end of the parking lot. Why did they not have me parking over there? Now people who arrived later received the better parking spots. That seems backwards and extremely frustrating. What they did right, or at least satisfactory, was crowd control. And at 10:00 sharp the busses were rolling. I was amongst the first to board and enter Nellis.

On the ground everything looked completely normal. All of the static displays, souvenirs, and food booths were as in years past. It is the same set up as always. It must be a master plan or something. ""Variety is the spice of life"" is a phrase unknown to the air show world. At least they are consistant. It makes it easier to navigate the rather long flight line on which spectators gather.  Having been many times (at least 5) in previous years, I did not see a need to look so in depth at all of the planes on display. I walked the length amd saw what there was to see and took a few pictures along the way. Perhaps most fascinating was the F-35 Lightning JSF which I anticipated seeing in the air later. It is new(ish) and highly advanced. Exciting.

Disappointing. The F-35 did in fact fly but not in the way I expected it to. Along with the bigger brother, F-22 Raptor, the Lightning opened the air show with a flyby. That was it. No flight demonstration as I had read on various sites. Come to think of it, there were several aircraft that did not fly that I was looking forward to. The B-1B Lancer, a P-38 Lightning, more than just two F-86 Sabers and one F-22 for the heritage flight. It used to be something like. P-51 Mustang, an F-86 Saber, an F-4 Phantom II, and an F-22 Raptor. Four planes representing four generations of air superiority. There was a lot missing from the air this year. And what did fly was not all too thrilling. Sure, some of it was cool. The Albatross was actually impressive for just a little trainor plane. But the reinactments actually put me to sleep. It was the same planes in the same order making the same gunning/bombing passes over and over again. Once is exciting. Twice is acceptable. Three times and more is just sad. Do you have nothing else to offer? The F-15 Eagles and F-16 Falcons were loud and fast and that is never a bad thing. Seeing them drop flares was kind of a cool feature. One I have not seen often at the air shows. But their little demonstration was short on variety. Where was the individual display of performance for these air beasts? They use to showcase what a modern jet fighter can do. The only one that really did this was the F-22 Raptor and no matter how many times I have seen it, I am always left in awe. Lockheed inginuity has made the F-22 one remarkable and wholly stunning beauty in the air. The things this plane can do is just unbelievable wven if you see it for your self. This, for me is the highlight of the show. I left after this and missedthe Thunderbirds. I have seen them so many times and I have the highest respect for them. I just don't need to see them perform everytime. When I am hot and tired I just like to beat the 100,000 people out of the parking lot. Especially since I have such a long walk back to my car.

I am grateful to Nellis AFB and all the armed forces for opening the base to the public. And for all they do for our country whether at home or abroad. But when it comes to Aviation Nation 2014, it was a let down when compared to the past years. Orginization just leaves something to be desired."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"We all got gift cards to Cracker Barrel for Christmas so the next time we were all together the family could go to dinner as we did tonight. Our first visit to this restaurant started out smooth enough. I arrived first and put in my name for a table for five. There was no line then. About 10 minutes later the rest of them pulled to the door and we stood in line waiting to be seated. We were taken to the back about 5 minutes after we got to the host station.

Having never been to Cracker Barrel before, we all took several minutes to look over the menu. We ordered iced tea all around and continued to decode what to order. When our drinks came out, my step mom, my dad and my aunt were given theirs first. As our waitress came around to my grandma the drinks fell and Grandma took a bath. Top to bottom she was pretty well soaked. The waitress apologized and very quickly brought a few towels to mop up the floor, table and chair. She also patted down my Grandma a little bit. She had already taken off the wet jacket but her pants, which were also wet, stayed on leaving poor Grandma wet and cold. Her meal was comped later after my aunt raised a little hell over the accident. We placed our food order shortly after the excitement had died down.

I ordered a Cracker Barrel Sampler. This comes with chicken and dumplings, meatloaf and ham with three sides. I ordered turnip greens, green beans and hash brown caserole. Meals also come with a choice of bread. I got both corn bread and a biscuit so I could try it all. The chicken and dumplings tasted good but I was disappointed that there was just one small piece of chicken. And the dumplings were like giant noodles. Not what I am used to but more traditional or so I am told. The meatloaf was a little bit spicy and very moist. I am probably in the minority here but I prefer a dried meatloaf with a nice crust. This was good though. The ham was just a small piece and very salty. Nothing more to say on that. The green beans were not at all exciting. I can tell they are canned beans and rather mushy. The turnip greens were good. Kind of like spinach but more grassy. They had nice shredded bits of pork mixed in. And the hash brown casserole was the best thing on my plate. Cheesey potato goodness. They only thing that could make that better would be a little more of a crust on top. 

The corn bread was just not good. It was dry, dense and over cooked. Some of the muffins were almost as dark and the rocking chairs out front. The biscuit, on the other hand, was good. Soft, warm and fresh. I'd stick with that for a bread option. 

The house salads my family ordered looked good but it was discouraging to see some of the dressings came in individual packs like you see at fast food restaurants. In fact, I recognized the Mezetti packaging from fast food. I'm not saying Cracker Barrel should make their own dressing in house but do they really need to bring you dressing packets?

My step mom and grandma both ordered the 8 oz. sirloin steak. Both ordered it medium-well. My grandma even said she didn't want to see any blood. The two steaks were done completely different. My step moms was medium-well. My grandmas was more medium and even close to medium-rare. There was blood. She still ate about half.

We also passed around a couple of orders of fried apples tonight. They remind me of the apple dessert I used to get in frozen dinners. Only this was more fresh. I suppose these were pretty good apples but they were very sweet. I would pass on them were I to go back.

A few final notes, I like the store. There are a lot of country goods in there. And some old fashioned candies and sodas. The restaurant decor is cool. I love seeing the antiques. There is a sign in there I would love to have in my garage. Too bad its not for sale. 

This place is OK but I'm not a huge fan. I wish the food was better than average. And I wish it was served warmer than we had it. I will be back again mostly because there is money left on that gift card from Christmas. But Cracker Barrel is not one of those places that I will be at often."
eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"This past Friday night was Yelp night at Cafe Mayakovsky as five of us Yelpers came together for Stefany V's first UYE.  The evening was due to begin at 7:00 and so I arrived early as is my normal course of action.  I was one of two who arrived too early and we were seated right away in a rather quiet restaurant.  There were maybe only two other parties there at the time.  Soon we were joined by Stefany and the rest.  With her was Boris who is from where these treats originate so he was a big help in explaning the menu.  Based on his descriptions we decided on several appetizers to order and share.  

We got beef tongue with horse radish, cold herring with potatoes and boiled egg topped with onion and dill, cabbage rolls stuffed with meat and topped with a sour cream sauce, a sort of potato and chicken salad and a mushroom and cheese dish.  Everything was brought out one at a time which lended plenty of time to tasting each individually without feeling too rushed.  I started with the herring.  I can say quite honestly this was my least favorite app but only for the simple fact that I don't care for fish.  But I did try it and found it to be salty and fishy.  It was about what I expected.  The potato and egg on the side were fine.  On to the tongue, I've had tongue once or twice before but only in small bites.  This was a whole slice and I did not know fully what to expect.  It turned out to be delicious.  It tastes very much like pot roast just minus the gravy.  If I was a fan of horse radish I would have used some of that on the tongue. I stuck with plain.  Next I tried the salad.  It was alright but nothing special.  Just potato salad with some chicken.  What I was most excited about might have been my favorite dish of the evening.  The cabbage rolls.  I had never tried Russian style and the sour cream sauce was a welcome difference to the usual tomato based sauce I am used to.  I love sour cream.  The cabbage itself was ultra tender and the meat moist and tender.  Sometimes the meat inside a cabbage roll can get dry and firm.  Not the case here.  Finally I tried the mushroom dish.  We got two little stainless steel measuring cup looking bowls filled with this sour cream and cheese sauce with mushroom bits.  I spooned a little onto my plate and enjoyed the creamy mushroomy goodness.  A close second to the cabbage rolls in my book.  Did I mention I love sour cream.

After we finished our shared appetizers we were on to ordering our entrees.  I ordered chicken Kiev.  Two at our table ordered lamb shashlik.  Stefany and Boris ordered stroganoff.  I saw some sort of ravioli dumpling dish too.  That looked good whatever it was.  I didn't hear them order.  When our food arrived, it all looked great.  The reality told a different story.  I think we were all less than impressed.  My Kiev was dry and over cooked.  The chicken was difficult to cut even with a knife.  And there was no gush of melted butter like I know Kiev to have.  Infact, I could hardly tell there was ever any butter in there at all.  If there had been then maybe the chicken would have been more moist.  The mashed potatoes on the side were flavorful but dense.  The cole slaw on the side was bland.  I was told the lamb shashlik had good flavor but was over cooked.  And that the stroganoff was lacking seasoning.  The first that that was said is that it needed salt.  A swing and a miss on entrees tonight.

With my meal I wanted to try a Russian beer.  I ordered a Baltica 9 which is classified as a dark lager.  It was hardly dark.  Slightly darker than a Budweiser I would estimate.  The alcohol content was consideralbly higher though.  I think 8% in this 25 oz. bottle.  The higher alcohol content gave the beer a slightly sweet taste.  Overall not a bad beer.  I would have liked it better colder.  Ales are OK on the warmer side but I like my lagers chilled.

I'm glad I got to try Cafe Mayakovsky this one time.  Even if I wasn't highly impressed.  Company was awesome.  Appetizers were good.  And now I have a story to tell.  But the story ends here I'm afraid.  I have no immediate plans to return to Cafe Mayakovsky."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Ok, I'll admit it. I have spent loads of money at Williams Sonoma. My mistake.

The other rainy day I stopped in to buy a couple of wedding gifts.

For 15-20 minutes I looked around the store trying to find gift ideas. Not once did any of the not very busy employees offer to help. Finally, I decided to approach one who began to act busy and move away. Then, another one, looked at me, quickly giving me the ""up down"".

I will admit to having had on jeans and to have been carrying a backpack for my potential purchases. As I grew frustrated I noticed a lady with a Burberry scarf having no trouble attracting employees. (I also observed that she bought nothing.) Quickly, I realized the error of my ways... I had left my @$&"")(;! Burberry trench and scarf at home!!! 

It might be that all the employees of Williams Sonoma are just in Toronto living in one of their penthouse condos for the season and just needed a job to occupy their time, and are therefore natural experts in sizing up potential customers. It may also be that Williams Sonoma trains employees to discriminate, or simply be discriminating. Either way, you lost a good customer, but probably won't notice.

For everyone else, I offer this advice...

1. If your race doesn't match the ""big spender"" profile, make sure the Prada and Versace labels are visible to the employees when you walk in.

2. If you want high end and not so high end kitchen gadgets, most of what they sell at WS can be found on line or at Home Sense for much cheaper."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"This theater is massive.  There are lots of food options, ranging from a Tim Horton's that doesn't have movie theater prices to a full-service bar.  There are the usual movie theater popcorn and soft drinks at outrageous prices.  Here are some key points....

1. The place is almost always crowded.  Even though the parking lot has a thousand spaces or more, there may be more people than that who are trying to park.  One night I had to give up and go home because I could not find a space.  If you can go to a later show on Sunday or earlier in the week, parking and lines are not a problem.

2. Ditto for the ticket line.  This line works fairly well, but plan on a 10-15 minute wait on busy Friday and Saturday nights.

3. The place is by no means spotless, but they do a reasonable job keeping things clean.

4. Cineplex Odeon offers replays of classic movies and other similar types of promotions to throw a bone to the die-hard movie fans every once in a while.  You will usually find these promotions highlighted on the web site or on your $5 soft drink cup.

5. Customer service is OK, but could be better.  That being said, at least everyone is in a matching uniform and looks the part of a team that is trying.

6. Many movies are now offered in 3D.  There is a nice up charge for all of these.  Check to make sure your desired movie is not in 3D before you come, or you may pay closer to $20 for a ticket.

The place is big enough to attempt one or two screens with bar/restaurant style service in the theater.  I would like to see an attempt at this."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"I love Chipotle, and I admit to eating here often. The food is good, but there are some frustrations here that bear mentioning....

1. Chipotle is 6.85$ in the states, but 8.95 here. I get it that there are different currencies, but they aren't that different.
2. This place is often very busy. You may encounter long waits at lunch and dinner. 
3. Because of the demand, customer service here is pretty bad. This location is like most McDonald's..they make so much money they don 't have to give a shit.  I admit to contributing to this dilemma by returning regularly.
4. Depending on who's making your order, you may get a very skimpy portion of rice, beans, and definitely meat. You must ask if you want veggies, and they always skimp on these.  It is almost comical watching them trying to either scoop a small portion or shaking parts of full scoops back into the bins. (Although this is probably right after they've been chewed out for being too generous.)
5. One of the soft drinks is usually unavailable at the beverage stand. Check this as you enter. It sucks to want a coke, pay 2$ for a small cup, then find out there is no coke.
6. Guacamole is a pretty hefty extra charge on a burrito that, while better, is already more expensive than BurritoBoyz who does provide guac. To get the most of the guac, order it as a side. You are charged the same, but tend to get a bit more.

If you are aware of these annoyances and are not afraid to have eyes rolled at you when you insist on a few more beans or a little more rice, this Chipotle has a good burrito."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"I have been here on three previous occasions and returned the other night for the first time in a few months.

Sadly, the menu, food, and experience had changed. 

Initially, they seemed set on having a good vibe with reasonably creative pizzas. Now, it seems like they got carried away, trying to be some culinary surprise or win Top Chef Canada, and no longer a pizza place. Here's what's wrong:

1. The pizzas at my table were too salty, too greasy and had too much going on.
2. The tuna app was unappetizingly fishy.
3. They try to take a page from pizzeria Libretto... By using ingredients (meats) no one has heard of or eats often, they can seem more sophisticated and charge more money. The problem here is that they go too far. I had rather pay 18$ for a damn good pepperoni pizza than a lousy pizza that has leeks, walnuts, speck, cat hearts, or whatever else no one can pronounce or recognize.
4. They have a beautiful bar, but no bar business. The bar identity (like the restaurant) is torn between pizza place bar and sophisticated cocktail bar. It does neither well. They need smaller, simpler bar plates and possibly a beer or wine special or damn good cocktails to build this side of the business.
5. Without alcohol my bill came to nearly 100$ with tax and tip for two pizzas and two appetizers that were all somewhere between ok and ""never again"".

The place is nice and the staff are clearly trying their best to provide decent service. However, it is too expensive and off the mark to make this my (or anyone's) go to (or return to) pizza place."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"So glad that Chipotle is open at The Stockyards. While the imminent closing of Target may hurt, the place should be good enough to survive and thrive. I will be a regular here.

The staff here are still coming up to speed with all details of customer service, yet they are friendly and eager to help customers.

If you are new to Chipotle, the negatives (especially for the neighbourhood) centre around price. A burrito bowl and a drink costs 12.20, which is a fair deal for quality and portion, but still high for those accustomed to walking out the door at McDonald's for a hair under $9.


Here are a few hints...

1. Guacamole costs 2.21 extra. Debates rage as to why this is, and whether it is better to order this as a side or on top of a bowl. Know this going in and you will be ahead of any worries about this cost.

2. Sometimes (depending on the server) they will skimp on meat or not offer you the grilled veggies. It is ok to ask for a little more!

3. If you want it, ask. They will do half mild, half medium salsa. They will mix black and pinto beans for you. Etc.

4. The stainless steel container to the right of the soda fountain is unsweetened tea. If you like unsweetened tea or just want a low/no calorie option, it is available, along with fresh-cut lemons.

5. They try to source ingredients locally. They also use hormone-free and humanely raised meats. They also have vegetarian options (sofritas?) which is surprisingly good.

6. You can park in the deck and enter from the back side of the store (as well as the side that fronts St.Clair Ave.)"
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Lord yes. After wandering a while in the wilderness of overhyped Toronto restaurants, a friend suggested we try this place. Turns out that Montgomery's is one of the best meals I have had in Toronto in the last year.

Montgomery's is that subtle place that sneaks up on you unawares. You enter into a kitchen/front of house area that looks like a school lunchroom, yet are taken to a warmly-lit, elegant dining area in the back of the house.

The menu is built around sharing plates. I shared a pork and duck terrine with mustard, lettuce broth, a cabbage dish, mushroom and black truffle dish, and a trout before heading on to the honey cake and financiers for dessert. Everything was delicious and pleasantly surprising. Lettuce broth? Sounds terrible, yet turns out to be amazing. The fish was cooked perfectly; the financiers- omg; and those mushrooms were out of this world.

The dining room seats approximately 30-40 people and has a fairly low-key vibe. There is no loud bar or music blaring, so the place makes for a good romantic or business dinner where conversation is important.

They have a respectable wine list and a helpful sommelier. Wine prices by the glass are a bit high though. Most start at 15$. A nice, cheaper red option, both by glass and bottle would be nice. (Even Scaramouche manages a cheaper bottle or two.) For dessert they have a sumptuous glass of Moscato d'asti that is 10$. Goes well with the honey cake.

I left here feeling completely satisfied. This is a culinary delight that can serve vegetarians a delicious meal as well. I can't wait to go back."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Bom Bom de Dom Dom Dom Vesuvio.

This place is at the geographic and restaurant epicenter of The Junction, which hopefully some day, will mean something more than it does now.

I have been to Vesuvio a few times.  Here are the main points...

1. The pizza is very good, but I would not call it great.  It has been granted (somewhere) the title of ""Best Pizza in the City"".  Perhaps, if you consider Toronto a mediocre pizza town.

2. The place has the feel of what would pass as a nice date place on Jerseyliscous.  It has a certain casual charm about it without being classy.

3. Vesuvio features both a take out area and a main dining area that are completely separate.  If you want to get take out in your pajamas, no worries.

4. Service is slow and clumsy at times, but not in a way that makes your blood boil.  (Unless you are the type that gets angry as the glass of wine begins to take effect). The servers are generally friendly and seem to be making a genuine effort.

5. If it seems a little fancy sounding or difficult for a 10 year old to pronounce, don't order it.  The lasagna (which takes forever to prepare) is well worth it.  The spaghetti and pizza also taste very good.  Most other things can be hit or miss.  Swim at your own risk. 

6. Vesuvio has a decent bar and ample selection of wine and beer.

7. The prices here are average to maybe a bit high.  This is not the cheapest place in town.  Expect to pay $30-$35 per person with a glass of wine.

Overall, I would give this place 3 1/2 stars.  Once you know what you like here, it is a comfortable place to visit more than once."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"BurritoBoyz is one of those places that could be great, but seems content to be average. 

The ""small"" chicken burrito I had was close in size to a Chipotle burrito. Instead of paying 12.20$ at Chipotle for a burrito and pop, this burrito and pop was a deal at 7.90.
Chipotle gives unlimited pop refills, while Boyz includes guac in its burritos.
Beyond value is where things go off track a bit. While all of these things are correctable, they knock stars of the experience...

1. Customer service is average at best. The staff are not especially friendly (the guy running the grill is a positive exception) or proactive in checking on the customers for feedback while they are dining. I mentioned to the cashier that someone had left their gloves at the counter. She just looked at me and shrugged. (Later, I found the customer who left the gloves with minimal effort.)
2. The chicken could be of a higher grade/quality. It also comes in pieces that are too small.
3. Employees refill all of the ingredient bins straight out of plastic bags at the counter, giving an impression that the ingredients aren't fresh.
4. Peppers and onions would be better grilled.
5. My medium heat burrito had jalapeño peppers with seeds all in it. Jalapeño pepper seeds overpower any burrito.
6. The place seems clean, but open recycling bins and a wall of business cards makes the place look more cluttered and cheap than it should.

Improvements in customer service and food quality would make this place better and worth spending a couple extra bucks.

If you want a reasonably cheap burrito before a night out on College Street, this fits that bill."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Two and a half stars. Here's what you need to know...

1. Seat yourself, either at the bar or the tables behind the bar.
2. Order using the I-pad provided at your seat. The order buttons are at the bottom of the screen. While it is not completely intuitive, you can do it.
3. A coke is 3$. Burgers are 13-16$. Fries and onion rings are extra. Hell, even pickles on your burger are an extra buck. If you get burgers, fries, and a coke, expect to be over 25$ after tax and tip.
4. Service is not horrible, but the logic seems to go like this...you will have been looking at their I-pad and won't notice that they haven't noticed you. The place is dirtier than it should be.
5. The burger is decent. It is freshly prepared, but rather smallish, especially for the price. It hides under a large bun.
6. You can order to go burgers or buy snack items from a refrigerated station they have by the register. The service here (I sat at the bar by the register for an hour and observed ) is poor at best. 
7. The to-go snacks are terribly expensive. 4.50 for a Snapple? The prices are not posted here for a reason. I watched as people continually asked. The answer was always ""something like 4-5 dollars"", never a scan to check or specific amount until someone had paid. The snack area is brilliant because it is mainly there to cash in on vouchers provided by airlines for delayed flights. (When Starbucks is cheaper than a kiosk, something is a bit wonky.)

In conclusion, this is at least one more option in a section of Pearson with limited options on everything, including seating, food, etc. Eat here if you are absolutely starving, but don't expect too much."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Geez. After reading some other reviews, I hope I don't offend to many people with this one! I also promise that Chipotle has not offered me any stock options or even a free side of guac for this review.

Here are some points for those who may not have tried this yet ...

1. They have a limited selection if burritos, tacos, and a bowl. (Burrito without the tortilla shell). They offer pork , beef, chicken, and a vegetarian option called safritas.
2. The bowls and burritos are 8.95$ before tax. The burritos and bowls are both huge and made with ingredients that are usually organic or from animals that are farmed with care, which is more than most similar places can claim. For some people, this is apparently the same price as a meal at Canoe.
3. The guac costs an extra 2.21$. It is made in house. 
4. Toppings that do not incur an extra charge include grilled peppers and onions, salsas, corn, pinto or black beans, shredded cheese, lettuce, and sour cream. They have a choice of three Tabasco sauce flavours as well.
5. The staff at this location seem to be friendlier than at the other location on Yonge. They also don't seem to try to skimp on ingredients like the Yonge location sometimes does.
6. The burritos and bowls are delicious. You will be hard pressed to find a better burrito anywhere in Toronto.
7. They offer unsweetened tea for those who like sugar free iced tea in the summer. (It is in the metal container by the fountain drink station.)
8. They sell bottled beers and a margarita as well.
9. With the 13% tax, a bowl and a drink is $12.20. Yes, McDonald's, Popeyes, and a lot of food trucks are cheaper, but this is one case where you get what you pay for."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"If not the best, this is one of the best restaurants in Toronto. It is not cheap, nor is it the swankiest place in town (Scaramouche is great for that white table cloth special occasion). What it is is a relaxed, fun, feel-good table of home style deliciousness. Here are some points for those who might give it a try.

1. Make reservations.  There are two earlier (6 and 630) and two later  (830 and 9) seatings.
2. The meal is now 49$ per person. You get what they are serving that night. If you are worried (I.e. don't eat beef), call ahead or check online for the menu. The restaurant focuses on simple everyday ingredients, so don't worry that the main course will be Mammoth Cave bats.
3. A meal includes an amazing salad, a main course with three sides, a cheese plate and a dessert. It is served family style or everyone in your party. The other night I had flank steak with asparagus, foraged mushrooms, and potatoes with beets. It was great.
4. Cocktails are a bit pricey at 14$ each, but you can't go wrong. The Great Gatsby on now is de-lish.
5. Chef Lynn Crawford is usually here working. While she is quite the celebrated chef, you will see her plating food, bussing tables, greeting guests, and simply doing anything and everything. She made me laugh when after clearing my plate after two consecutive courses, she chided me for spilling food off of my plate ""the last time as well.""
6. The atmosphere here is fun and relaxed. It can get a bit loud, but it is all good.
7. The service is experienced, but can be a bit scattered at times.  The order and timing of food delivery to the tables is flawless.

Enjoy a true Toronto treasure. Ruby Watchco is worth repeat visits."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Recently I had lunch here. It was a horrible experience. I was drawn in by the visible cool and funky factor of the wood floors and tin on the walls. Everything went to hell after that.

First of all, about 4 items of the 10 item menu were unavailable. Not to worry, the pork (12.99 for a half-pound) I wanted was available. I ordered and was told it would be 15 minutes, which seemed long for pre-done pork and slaw, yet I waited. 

1. I was offered ice and a glass for my Coke, yet never got it.
2. The order took 45 minutes to arrive. If you have an hour for lunch, this sucks. I noticed a few of the only- a-few customers complaining about the long wait to little avail other than being told to wait more. One poor sucker who had called in a to go order was asked (after he had been waiting at least 25 minutes) if just ""wanted to eat it here.""
3. Loud music blared through the impressive speakers. If you like loud music where every song has the ""n"" word or some demeaning reference to women, or if you don't want to hear yourself think or someone else speak, you will love it.
4. The pork itself, when it finally arrived, was flavourful, yet a bit salty and came in chunks that were more fat than pork. It was topped with a nastily hot pepper. It came with a decent side of slaw and 2 small pieces of white bread.
5. The pork, a small glass bottle Coke, and 15% tip (because while I wanted to give a low tip 15% or no tip were the only low options) comes to $20.78.
6. As I paid after my meal, I noticed the picture above the cash that included in the photos section. Had I seen this before, I would have left. Objectification of women, while a lucrative enterprise, is not what I want to support."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"The ROM is a difficult place to review because museums and their respective collections and functions evoke a wide range of passions.  Here are five things that I noticed the most that would have influenced a first visit, as well as repeat visit.

1. The service, from the coat check area to the ticket counter to staff throughout the museum, has a real air of pretense.  I don't mind being made to feel insignificant in the presence of the resident Egyptologist, but not by the coat checker.

2. The museum is a bit much for one visit, unless you enjoy spending the better part of a day in one place, or only have a day in Toronto.  There are really great and extensive displays of everything from Canadian history to every prominent BC culture in the world, including dinosaurs.  For Fine Art, go to the Art Gallery of Ontario.

3. Like other Yelp criticisms, the sense of the place you get from its funky modern exterior, is not repeated on the inside.  The displays are neatly laid out, but for the most part, it is sterile.  While you may not want the museum to be a bigger attraction than its contents (the Getty), the ROM seems lifeless at times.

4. Following on point #3, the museum needs more interactive exhibits.  The ROM is mostly about looking at objects in a display case and reading a description.  The other senses are not stimulated.  IF I were bringing children, I would skip straight to the dinosaur exhibit (or whatever was the kid draw of the month), and leave off the rest.

5. Check the prices and times before you go.  They are advertising a coming price drop, and you can go for a reduced rate as a student or after 4:30 on Friday evening.  Otherwise you may receive a bit of sticker shock."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"3030 is one of a limited number of bar options in the Junction.  It manages to draw a large crowd for its space, but is not the best in the area. On my most recent visit, the beer was warm and the service was lousy.  While the service is typically lousy, the beer is not usually warm.  Here are some key points...

1. The place is a large space.  On the left side as you walk in, there is a bar, while a little further back beyond the restrooms, there is a back bar.  The front bar has a few beers and is mainly for food, where the back bar handles most of the cocktails.  On the right side of the place there is a bank of old pinball machines and board games that you can bring to a table.

2. You order your drink at the bar, then find a seat (if you can.)  There are about 12 beers on tap here.    

3. The crowd here is almost entirely Caucasian between the ages of 28 and 32.  It is not really a hipster crowd, but more of a young professional crowd.

4. The place is best for meeting a group of friends, not for parties of two or one.  Most people arrive as a group of four or more.  If you observe, you will notice (especially on busy nights) that couples will often turn around and walk out because it is loud, there are few tables, and the service is not inviting.  It is a loud and festive atmosphere. Even louder when they have live music playing on the stage in the back.

5. The prices for cocktails are a bit high and the pours are small.

6. The food is OK.  The best bet is to opt for the later evening ""snacks"" that run around $5.  The main meals are good enough, but the atmosphere may not lend itself to a $20-$30 entree.

In conclusion, if you are not picky about service and you come with a group of friends within the age demographic, you will be fine with this place."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Jacobs serves a good steak. I've been here a few times, and here are a few points to ponder....

1. The steaks are served hot and juicy. They are very good, but can at times be too salty. For 58$ and up, they ought to be good. If you have eaten much steak before, you will not eat the best steak you ever had here. That is, unless you are trying to console yourself for spending so much money OR if someone else pick up the check.
2. The sides are good, but do not stand out. They generally serve two people, but some, such as the average mashed potatoes, can be stretched much further.
3. The appetizers are better than the sides. Try the tuna app, as it is a contrast to a steak and a generous portion.
4. The service is sterile and average. If you like watching someone chop up a Caesar salad table side for 10 minutes rather than talking to others at your table, Jacob's has a few gimmicks like that. Otherwise, expect a mixed bag of service.
5. If you have a special occasion and want to bring in an outside cake, Jacob's charges 5$ per person extra.
6. Jacob's does not split checks. On my last visit, my party of 7 individuals had to calculate our own individual payments from one 1,000$+ check. We were then continually rushed as we tried to calculate. The server was rude about this, insisting that their system did not have a way of separating checks. It would seem that Jacobs could afford a better system. 

Conclusion: Go here if you have a very, very special occasion with a high maintenance special someone who demands lots of money be spent OR if your company has a bottomless corporate expense account. Otherwise, you may find Jacobs to be an overpriced decent steakhouse. 

If this is one if the highest rated places in Toronto, it says a lot about Toronto's need for improvement at the top end of its restaurant scene."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Popeye's chicken is yummy. While I like to be a food snob at times, I also like my Popeye's. It is greasy, but good.  However, three stars might be generous considering my experiences here. Let's say two and a half.

The problems with this Popeye's (and this may be the case with others are)..

1. The place feels very sterile. It has no drive thru, so when you come in, you want to at least feel comfortable eating there. Not here.
2. The service can be very good, or very not good. Sometimes employees do not get orders right or listen carefully to what you say. On the last visit, while being refused an extra sauce (I did not have the 28 cents cash, see next point), I decided not to mention that they forgot the biscuit on my order.
3. There are petty up charges for everything, like a quarter plus tax for an extra sauce (one is not really enough) and 50 cents plus tax for a refill on a fountain drink that was already not cheap. If you have no cash, it is a frustrating use of a charge card. Good grief, just charge everyone a few cents more up front and give them all the sauces they want.  In most cases it will be two, not a hundred.
4. Everything that is not an extra charge is behind the counter. I'm sure it is a corporate policy, but to worry that the customers are going to bankrupt you by running off with too many napkins sends a negative signal. Maybe demographic research has shown that a typical Popeyes customer comes to the restaurant primarily to have straw popping fights or steal napkins to line their bird cage for a year. Not quite sure.
4. Again, the place feels like a franchise that someone in Los Angeles or New York owns who has never actually set foot in the place. The management does do an ok job, but you don't get the sense that anyone cares you ate here. At least Tim Horton's sometimes pretends like it."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"There are three star places that merit a visit. There are those we just love and return to in spite of some flaws. This is a three star place that fits both categories. It is fun and has the potential to be great with some improvements.

Here are a few finer points....

1. The food is good overall. From experience I can say.....

The pizza.... Is well put together, but bland. The three little pigs pizza lacks flavor. For 15$, it is not quite inspired.

The burger is above average, but not spectacular.

The shrimp po boy is excellent.

The macaroni dishes are creative and delicious. Try the one with the BBQ inside.

The ""late night"" sage popcorn, while a creative snack in a sack, is extremely oily. Avoid it.

2. The service is average. The staff, perhaps overwhelmed from the early crowds, seems exhausted and overburdened. After four visits, I have encountered forgotten silverware, incorrect checks, and mishaps each time.

3. The bar area is ok if you prefer sitting at a bar, but it is no different from sitting at at a table. The bartender is serving beer for the entire restaurant, so there is no real attention given to those seated at the bar. Also, there is a small display of quality liquor, but it appears to be an afterthought.   The bar area and service could be improved.

4. The beer is all over the map. The Indie has about 12 choices. Tell them what kind of beer you prefer, and they will customize a 5 beer flight.  Some of the beers are really great, while others are questionable at best.  In time, they should do better.

This place is such an improvement over most places in the Junction that they will have a booming business and many accolades for a while. I hope they don't get stuck where they are.

As a near neighbor, I want this place to do well for the long haul. With some effort at improvement across the board, this place could be famous."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Slowly, but surely the restaurant glacier is expanding toward the Junction, where more nice restaurants are needed. Farmhouse is a respectable place on the outer fringe of the Junction. Here are a few key points....

1. Farmhouse has a bit of a Black Hoof feel. The space is relatively small with an open kitchen. There is the requisite menu on a blackboard and a small bar.

2. The food is a bit creative, but not spectacular. The trout ceviche, which was oversold, under delivered. The favors were uneven.  Bland one bite, spicy hot the next.   It was basically citrus juices and other ingredients on top of trout.  The duck appetizer was not warm, but a really good idea.

3. Other food options include lamb, a ravioli, pork belly, and a surf and turf.  There are also charcuterie plates, oysters, and cheese plates.  Most mains are 20-30$. I had a farmhouse burger.  It was good, but for 15$, no different than any backyard burger. The lettuce was pale green/white iceberg, and the bun was a typical seeded No Frills bun.  I was not asked how I wanted it cooked. It came out a nice medium rare, which was ok.  The burger plate came with a monstrous pile of fries.

4. The service is average. The staff were nice, but overextended, trying to wait on too many people at once. Interestingly, in the tight space, they did not take coats. Everyone had coats on chairs or piled beside them.  

5. The cocktails were well priced and pretty good.  (The wine prices are a bit high. i noted a Niagara wine i had at home at 4 times more than i had paid.) unfortunately, there were only two ""special cocktails"" and no cocktail menu. The wine list is on one of the chalkboards.

6. The food prices are high for the over all quality and experience. An appetizer, main course, cocktail, and glass of wine could easily be 100$ after tax and tip.  Nice, but this is just not a 100$ place.

Three and a half stars."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"After hearing about The Black Hoof from a friend and lots of hype and five star yelp reviews, I decided to check it out. I have been on a quest to find a great Toronto restaurant that can be my local favorite. I had high hopes that the Hoof could deliver. 

Here are my conclusions for those who may want a slightly different take.....

The place merits five stars on a few points. 

1. It has a great charcuterie plate

2. It also has highly creative dishes. I mean, how many times have you had horse, beef hearts, or bone marrow at more respectable places in Toronto? 

3. The Black Hoof also has a cool, trendy vibe for those who need that.

4. All the food is prepared in a kitchen where four people are cooking and cleaning in a space about half the size of an average condo kitchen. This is most impressive.

Beyond this, there are negatives....

1. The food is good, but not great overall. The Black Hoof offers pork tacos and tuna crudo for those who had beef hearts for lunch. These taste the same as they do anywhere else with a touch of added flair and expense.

2. The portion sizes are small, like tapas or appetizers, but approaching full entree price at similarly styled places. If you are hungry, you will need to spend high end money to fill up here.

3. The cocktails are expensive. They range from $11 for an undersized margarita, to $17. A half-liter of sangria is $23. This would be understandable at a nicer cocktail lounge that makes everything from scratch on the spot, but this is not that. Here you are a maximum of 15 feet from the hot stove when the beef livers are sizzling. My two drinks were good, but nothing special.

4. The service is not very good, though in fairness, everyone seems to be scrambling to navigate the tight quarters and avoid any back up in the tiny kitchen.

In the end, go to say you've been, and maybe go back to impress your friends with your refined taste in bone marrow. That should just about do it."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"After two visits here, a review is in order.

Nodo is a very good Italian restaurant opened by three Italian friends in the Junction between Mavety and Keele on the south side of Dundas (close to Mavety).

1. In two visits I had a seafood spaghetti dish (19$) which was delicious, as well as a sausage pizza (13$) that was good with the exception of overly dry sausage. I also had a green side salad (9$) that was excellent, as well as cannoli for dessert, which was very good, but not the best I have had. The fritto misto (11$) was fried well, but lacked flavour. Perhaps a thinly sliced fried lemon would add to the taste.
2. The restaurant is quite nice. It has both a loud, fun vibe, while managing to have a softness and warmth about it that makes it great for all occasions.
3. Another nice thing here is a wine special (19$) where you can choose three smaller pours from a select list of red and white wines by the glass. The pours were sufficiently generous.
4. I sat at both the bar and in the restaurant. Nodo has the same challenge/problem that everyone who has opened a restaurant in the Junction in the past year has... The bar is somewhat of an afterthought. Rather than having at least one designated bar tender (who is highly knowledgeable about the wines, cocktails, etc) engaged with the bar and customers at the bar about wine or opinions about spirits, the bar serves as the dishwashing station where the staff (who are very nice here) are much more engaged frantically washing glasses, drying glasses, cleaning the counter, making Espressos and filling tap waters for the restaurant customers. They could have a serious bar business here. That being said, they make a good cocktail AND the seat in the restaurant is the better choice. Service in the restaurant is excellent.
5. Nodo is off to a great start, and I believe it will only get better. Service is better than a lot of places and the food is too. Be sure to make a reservation, as it does fill up fast after 6:30."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Welcome to the Junction!!

While there is still plenty of room for growth, The Junction area is slowly, but surely gathering steam. Playa Cabana is a great new addition to the neighborhood.

Located on Dundas, one block west of Keele roughly across from the new Indie Ale House, Playa Cabana is a fun, funky place to eat and drink. Just open a week, I believe this can be a 5 star place once service details are ironed out over the coming weeks. I loved eating here. Here are some of the facts...

1. Playa Cabana has a sister restaurant at Davenport and DuPont. The restaurant features a main seating area, an oyster bar with fresh oysters on ice right in front of you, and a main bar in the back of the restaurant.

2. The menu consists mainly of oysters, seafood dishes (ceviche), and fresh tacos, salsas, etc.  Everything is prepared in house. The chips (which are a staple to any such establishment) are made in house AND probably the best anywhere.

3. The cocktail menu is the creation of the bartender. There are margaritas, as well as other selections. The T.O Cointreau hit the spot. The bar also has Dos Equis (and possibly others) on draft. The bar area is lively and busy, without being unnecessarily crazy.

4. From 11-2 at night Thurs.-Sat., Playa Cabana offers 3 tacos for 12$. They are made fresh to order on the oyster bar area once it is done for the night.

5. The service is good, but still learning its way. That being said, everyone was super nice. Like many new restaurants, this place has the requisite ""hipster vibe"". The difference here is that these hipsters are actually friendly and seem to really care about the restaurant and its customers.

6. The restaurant requires reservations for tables, and I learned that these can be made on line.

7. The restaurant is loud, but fun. Briefly met the owner, and he said that much of the decor came from the way-cool shop just across the street. (Cool that they used a neighboring small business.)

I will definitely be back. You should check it out."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Shakespeare in the Park is a semi-hidden near-gem. Here are a few helpful pointers for the uninitiated.

1. Shows run in the summer until the end of August. They are at 8 pm each night, but are off on Monday night. This season Macbeth is WFSUN, while Taming of the Shrew is TThSat.
2. The location is not the easiest to find. If you enter the park at Bloor and High Park you will pass tennis courts, then a food kiosk on your left. At the four way stop (about a km from the park entrance) the entrance to the amphitheatre is on your right. There will be some people in bright neon coloured shirts standing at the dirt path that leads to the amphitheatre.
3. The cost is a suggested 20$, but is pay what you can. I imagine that anything under 10$ would be heavily frowned upon!
4. Nice warm evenings (where you can wear shorts and a t shirt) are sort of rare, even in summer. On such evenings and weekends, you should arrive at least 15-20 minutes early to get a seat. Otherwise, you will be standing. The amphitheatre doesn't have formalized seats with numbers, so in some places people take up more room than they need with bags and picnic baskets (these are the same people who put their stuff in empty seats on the subway while everyone is standing). To overcome this, arrive early!
5. The acting is done by students from York University. I saw Macbeth this year. The performances each season tend to be good, but will have actors who overact or flub lines here and there, while others are brilliant. The witches in Macbeth were fantastic this season.
6. Bring your own picnic or snacks, but try to be done munching and rattling paper before the performance starts.
7. Before you bring your young kids, remember that Shakespeare has violence in the tragedies and some sexual suggestive humour here and there in the comedies. (I wound up by a family that was constantly groaning and trying to cover their son's eyes every time their was a stabbing in Macbeth. It was kind of funny, but also a bit annoying.)
8. Again, on a nice evening it is worth finding Shakespeare in the Park."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Public Storage is obviously a place for you to store your stuff between home moves, relocations, or simple overcrowding.

Let me help you navigate this:

1. As soon as you know you will need this location, contact them about rental rates, available units, etc. If you can, plan a separate trip to see a unit and getting any info on special promotions before committing your money. They may tell you there is only one ground floor unit left or something similar to make you rush into making a payment. If you take a day to think about it or compare other places, you should be fine.
2. They do have no contract options where you can leave at most any time. This does require a couple of weeks notice generally. They can tell you when you commit.
3. They have units located on higher floors. If you have large or heavy items, you will want to have a ground floor unit.
4. The staff are helpful, yet can get testy very quickly if questioned too directly about anything. This is obviously a business like used car sales where the flow of connivery is a two way street. Everyone wants a discount or has a complaint on one side, while the experience with and defences against those things are always high on the other.
5. There is a personalized code access to a gate that you can access until 10:30 each night. The office itself closes around 5:30 or so.
6. You can provide your own lock or they have a cheap one they will sell you. They also sell boxes, tape, moving blankets, etc.
7. In my experience of moving items both early in the morning and late at night, I encountered people who appeared to live here. Not sure if they rented units or just used the long empty corridors. They never bothered me, yet it seemed obvious that they were using the units/property for more than storing their junk. The place is not all that well-lit after dark outside, yet the timer-activated corridor lights are bright. You may be best served to have someone else with you.
8. The process of signing contracts and accessing a unit is fairly straightforward. You can get that done in under a half-hour if need be."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Let me wade in with the other three star reviewers who are too timid to be harsh, yet too smart to gush just yet.

1. The Classic Mac n Cheese is just like any Mac n cheese you would eat at home. It lacks flavour (I hate saltiness, but this needed salt.) For 7.45$, the portion size I got to go was small.
2. They mainly have Mac n cheese is a few varieties and grilled cheese. The prices are a bit high to attract an under 14 demographic that eats lots of this, and the menu is a bit limited to woo you back. This kind of food is also damn tough to cater to ""to go"" customers, as grilled cheeses don't do well on cold walks home.
3. The service is personable and aiming to please. They are still ironing out kinks getting food out and explaining things. For example, don't tell someone who is waiting on a to go order that it will be five minutes, when in actuality it is 11-12. Don't over promise!!
4. There is no alcohol here, but they are open til 2 a.m on Weekends for those who have the munchies after the neighbourhood bars' kitchens have closed.
5. No credit cards, which sucks. I get not wanting to pay 2-3% on my 7.45$ Mac, but the great customer who wants to feed his entire work crew does want to get airline miles on his credit card for his 200$ order.
6. The inside space needs a tv showing sports or some other inducement to get people to sit inside. Right now, it has some dark corners, and the seats face a blank wall.
7. While this is not a cheese shop, they should possibly experiment with a particular ""cheese of the week"" or sell fresh locally sourced cheeses for people to take home to try to attract a wider audience.

It is super tough to start a business, especially in the ""up and coming"" Junction. The Junction has lots of mid-range coffee and restaurant competition with no weekday business people (virtually no one besides local residents who stay at home, shop owners, and traffic cops are here during the week in daylight hours. Weekends and nights are different.)

Hopefully Cut the Cheese will continue to improve its product and evaluate its menu and pricing structure. I hope they can succeed. It is worth trying."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Four stars is perhaps more generous than this deserves, yet with a little time and a bit of help from the Yelp-i-verse, it can get there.

I have been inside the restaurant and eaten twice. Once at the bar and once at a table. Here are some takeaways:

1. Like all average restaurants in Toronto the bar space here is used as a dishwashing area and employee cell phone charging/checking area. Interacting with customers at the bar who may come back and spend even more money happens, yet is not a high priority.
2. Service is decent here and could be better. Thus far there is a notably disproportionate amount of attention spent on friends and family of the place who have come by to offer their support to the owner. This is somewhat forgivable. (Early on, however, everyone should have the opportunity to hear firsthand what the place is all about. A little goes a long way.) Service was good at the table and the bar, yet had room for improvement. The tv at the bar does provide for some added entertainment on baseball/hockey nights.
3. The food here is good to very good. 
- the chicken plate- huge and quite delicious. It is the best deal here. More northern fried than southern fried.
- the biscuits with dill - skip. No southern or creole biscuits would ever use dill. These come off a bit lacklustre.
- the half-rack of ribs- very good, not too wet or dry. The sauce adds to the flavour nicely.
- fried green tomatoes - delicious.
- apple-celery root slaw - skip, unless you just want a pretty bland healthy option to cut a spicy or savoury dish.
4. The beer selection is excellent.
5. Wine? A bit of a random selection. They should focus their offerings. I think they could do Canadian wines exclusively by the glass and maybe do a few others by the bottle. Maybe an outside expert could help them showcase wine in a way that helps sell it.
6. From what small bit I was able to ascertain first hand, Junction Local hopes to evolve into a full-fledged BBQ machine sort of like Barque in Roncy and possibly drift/move away from their other options. They have the smoker and desire to do this. Time will tell.

I plan to return. Hopefully Junction Local will continue to improve. As the Junction heats up, so will the competition."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"I have returned a few times since my last review to Ruby Watchco. The visits have been slightly worse each time, so I thought a review update was in order.

On my most recent visit, I invited friends who were new to town to try it out. Here's how the experience went...and left me a bit disappointed, but also noticing a trend.

1. First, we had an 830 reservation. Since they were not ready to seat us, they left us out in the tiny entry area for 15 minutes while people came and went, stepping on our feet as we held the door for them. No apologies for the wait.
2. We were finally seated, but waited another 10 minutes for a server.
3. The cocktails were good and all 14$ each. The cherry bomb was excellent.
4. The first part of the 49$ (before tax and tip) meal was a delicious beet salad. Somehow, the salads can be the best part of the meal here and were again.
5. They served us 4 small biscuits with the salad as always. When one of my guests asked for another one, they were told they would be charged for it. (Our total bill was 500$, and we couldn't get one damn biscuit? Nope.)
6. The meal came. It was kale, heirloom carrots, celery root purée, and a small piece of salmon. Not exactly exciting or in any way a value for 49$.
7. The meal followed with four very small pieces of Quebec goat cheese and Chef Lora's chocolate bread pudding (which was memorable only for being forgettable.)
8. A cheaper bottle of wine and 6 cocktails brought the bill to 500$. 
9. Service was pleasant, but felt more like a sales role than a service role.

I think Lynn Crawford is awesome. She was not here on this visit or my visit before this one. However, I get the sense that they have plenty of business without mine, which kind of saddens me, because I have taken many people there (and even received a Review of the Day for hyping the place on Yelp!)

For a while, and in my old review, I considered Ruby Watchco to be one of the best restaurants in town. Now, I am backtracking from that. There are places that offer carrots, kale and fish for much less, as well as places that can wow for the same money.

If you haven't been and have plenty of money, maybe you should try it. The vibe is still loud and fun, even if the shine has faded a bit from the silver."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Ok, so for those of you who have never been in or heard of Wal Mart, this review will help you, as well as many who shop there regularly understand things better.

1. First of all, Wal Mart is not Holt Renfrew, nor is it the local produce stand. Customer service costs a lot at those places. Wal Mart is in the business of cutting costs, as well as perhaps cutting the throat of the produce stand guy. Service is a cost. Really good service is a higher cost.

2. Managing a large number of employees is a challenge at any business, especially a large retailer, which hires young (cheap) managers where most employees fall into the following categories...

A. I would rather be siting at home right now, doing nothing.
B. this is only a temporary job for me. even though I hate it, I will go back to school, find something else, or move on soon.
C. I am still saying item B things, but it has been over a year here and am still here. I Hate my life.
D. I sort of like people and my job, but being only 1/4 of an understaffed equation, what can I do?

With these two points in mind, here are the core issues....

1. All three stars are for price. While the place has some issues, price drives my return visits. You will sometimes do better elsewhere (for example, the mums brought in recently at Wal Mart were slightly cheaper and much prettier at Home Depot), but mostly not.
2. The overflowing trash cans and loose trash in the parking lot are a discredit to the store and people who shop there.
3. Even with low prices, Wal Mart will often struggle with selling fresh items. A good price means nothing when you have herbs that are dried out, stale bread, or plants that haven't been watered. I have encountered all these things from a recent visit.
4. The place is never very clean, nor dirty. The brown floors probably help hide the grime, but they may also give the impression that the floors are not clean when they are.
5. Customer service is bad, though slightly better than terrible. see the intro.

If this Wal Mart could improve its customer service, manage its fresh items better, and show some respect for the community by keeping its parking lot and exterior clean, it would have more business from me and others who are driven to shop on price more often than not."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"Since my previous review of the Cheese Boutique, a lot has changed. While I still shop there regularly and hate changing reviews, I feel compelled to do so for the loyal yelp crowd that need more than repetitive ""awesomes"" or harsh criticisms based on obscure issues.

The Mouse House on Ripley is still a reliable place for mid-high priced gourmet cheeses, cured meats, and baked goods. You will still find a generous selection of pricier pastas, olive oils, and sauces.

Here is what has changed:

1. The layout. For several months the Cheese Boutique tinkered with the layout. Every time you went in, something was different or in a different location. Now, the cash is in a narrow space by the door that backs up on busy days. 
2. The products. To be fair, the layout was changed to accommodate more products and move toward being a full-service grocery store. This was (in my opinion) a mistake. Now you have produce, yet it is the same stuff you can get anywhere, only at a much higher price here. Recently I spotted a $9 container of blueberries. You can now get almost anything, yet much of this is more large chain grocery store than premium/boutique retailer.
3. The experience. Cheese Boutique expanded a bit to accommodate the move to a full-service grocery store. The addition looks cheap. You see plugs/wires in the ceiling, plywood, and signs that don't point to a well-insulated, nice space. Farm Boy looks far more grand than this. I can't imagine that an architect drew this up. With the expansion, other issues such as having to have your veggies priced when you put them in the buggy (no scales at check out?). Also, you have to take a number to be served at the cheese/meat counter. It might be efficient, yet this feels more like Service Ontario than anything high end.
4. The service. Service is now just ok. Yes, they still bring around an espresso while you shop at times, the guy who helps you park on busy days is great, and they let you sample cheese before you buy it. However, the staff seem frustrated or tired most of the time. The staff on the floor seem to always be too busy. Something is (at least to a regular like myself) a bit off. (On a recent visit, I bought burgers. Two were bright red, yet the others were brown. I asked about this and was told that the brown ones were made yesterday. I was assured they would be fine. Well, they were fine, but this (again) was not the experience I remember from past years.)
5. Prices. No one comes here expecting No Frills, yet prices are quite high for an experience that has fallen off. I recently paid over 17$ for twelve small pieces of biscotti after waiting 4-5 minutes to be served.

Definitely go if you haven't been, yet realize that Cheese Boutique is not the experience it once was."
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"A review of this place is overdue. I will preface this review by saying I am a member here, and I am generally satisfied with my experience. I also wanted to say that my review is less about the star rating and more about looking at different details that could be helpful to prospective members. 

Here are 11 key points:

1. When you join you pay for the first and last month, as well as 25$ for an access card (that you must return when you end your membership or face more charges). Depending on your membership (single or family), expect to have at least 200$ in charges up front, possibly much more.
2. Membership must be cancelled 35 days in advance. They will tell you it has to do with their credit card processing system (although most people who have ever had a credit card have never experienced anything so slow). Either way, you are pretty much on the hook for 3 months as soon as you join.
3. They allow you to suspend service for either 2 or 3 months during a year. While they charge 5$ for this, it is nice to be able to postpone service during a couple of summer/travel months.
4. They offer classes and services like personal training. Training costs extra, and some of the other services do, but others are a part of the membership. Ask what is included.
5. There is a open room completely underground where they offer classes and which can be utilized for things like stretching, jump rope, etc. There is also a single changing room and a single restroom down there.
6. The place can get slammed after work and when they are having classes. During these times there is limited locker space, coat space, and space for wet boots. It can be tough to keep your socks dry because the floor gets really wet! You will also encounter waits for treadmills and weight stations. If you come mid-day, there are no problems. Later at night is also good, but there are no staff present, and you sometimes encounter people coming with friends in larger groups.
7. Service is not the best, but it is OK. If you are signing up as a new member or if you are a female doing personal training, the experience is more personable. Beyond that, staff don't generally acknowledge you, which is not really that big of a deal for a drop in place. If you approach them, they are most often helpful.
8. They offer a water fountain, but you must bring your own water bottle. This is probably a mix of cheapness and something that is also good for the environment. The Junction does have enough litter already!
9. The place, partly because it is an older building, can get dusty. It seems that the equipment gets dusted more often of late, but it is not often super clean.
10. Like all gyms, you will pay more than you initially expect to and run into things like limited space (for changing, work outs, etc ). That being said, you have access here all the time. 
11. This is an everyone kind of place. It can be crowded with everyone at times, but it is nice that it attracts both men and women of all levels of personal fitness, not just bodybuilders and marathon runners!"
8D8mjeNaJ3DGhl0WX8copA,"This place was a disappointment. I figure that the rave reviews come from people who live far out and do not have easy access to better places in town, or because it is not located near any serious competition.

From the outside (as well as the reviews and the gracious hostesses) this place looks quite charming. And, to its credit, it has been around 25 years. 

Here are the challenges I encountered....

1. First of all, this is perhaps the most expensive place in town. That is not bad in itself. I like to eat well. When you can be more expensive than everyone and still bring them in, good for you.

2. Parking is a bit of a mystery. There is no valet. In the closest spaces there are ""Authorized Parking Only"" signs everywhere. Well, you are supposed to know to park in the basement of the deck across from the place.

3. The service was poor, and considering the hype of this place, it was really much worse than that. We were seated in a side room. There were six other tables (besides ours) occupied and one was an eight top. All guests were served by only one waiter!  There was not even a busboy. The waiter was scurrying around refilling water glasses, clearing plates, etc. This might be ok at Wendy's, but it wasn't working here. Besides the one waiter, we were humored by others on staff who raced in and out of the room resetting tables, rearranging, and putting out new linens. It was all completely frantic and unsettling. We finally just had to laugh at it, not knowing if the joke was on us. Especially watching the wait staff roll their eyes and jabber at each other as if no one could see or hear them. The one waiter, who nervously kept running his fingers through his hair, could've used their help, but they were clearly not ready for prime time.

4. The food was not very good for the money, or really if it had been free.  There was no amuse bouche. The 48$ steak had little to no flavor and came out medium, not rare as ordered.  It was served with mushrooms that were delicious. The steak tartare was a jumbled mess and at 22$, 5$ more than the delicious tartare at Scaramouche.  I was not offered a choice of temperature on my 42$ tuna. It was overcooked and served with octopus that tasted more like a sugarless gummy worm. Even determined to eat my expensive meal, i could not eat it, and I usually like octopus.  The ""Chinese broccoli"" was the best thing on the plate, and i do not tend to like oily wilted greens. The pomme de terre app was the best of the dishes. The potato had no flavor, but the dish as a whole was well-plated and had nice texture to it.

5. The cocktails and the table bread were the best parts of the dining experience.  The Smoky Manhattan, as well as the Southern Roots, were very nice, well-balanced drinks.

I imagine if I had been a regular (and sworn not to order from the very pedestrian looking Winterlicious Menu) I might've been seated in the much nicer main dining room, which might have helped avoid the service train wreck I experienced. Either way, the food still was not befitting of a place of such reputation.

I have been to places that I felt deserved a second chance. Not so sure here."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I love port of subs!  OMG this place rocks!  Everything here is fresh on site.  The bread is cooked and fresh, and they have white, wheat and Sourdough.  They have 3 sized subs, and a menu a mile long.  They have 18 cold subs to choose from, and some hot subs to choose as well.

They cut the meat as you order your sandwich. Not predone like other lame chains that shall go unnamed.

I usually get a #18, which is Roast Beef and Turkey with cheese.  mmmm, tasty.  I usually order a really big sub, eat half there, and take the other half home to eat for later.  I like it here because I really feel like I get a lot of food for my money.

There are two reasons why I gave them 4 stars.  First, this location has really crappy hours.  They close early, and sometimes, I can't get to them before they close.  I think they close at like 6PM or something.  booo!  Who are you catering to with this schedule?  I think they should be open until at least 8 PM.  so, points lost for crappy hours.

The other thing I am docking them for, was I had a bad service experience there today.  There were 3 people working behind the counter that I could see.  One girl slicing meat, one guy running the register, and a third guy doing stock and stuff with bread in the oven.

Well, since I got the combo meal which includes a beverage and chips, I went to the chip area and it looked pretty hit and wiped out.  The only chips left were the crappy flavors that I do not like.  I want plain chips, thats all.  I didnt want jalapeno (stomach doesnt like it) nor did I want the Dill flavored either.  I asked the gentleman who was doing bread and stock if he had any plain chips available.  He was rather snappy with me and said ""if we had them, they would be out there.  Whatever we have is on the shelf.""  He quickly blew me off, and I was aggrivated.  He told me to look at the other chip stand to see if I could find what I was looking for. 

Fortunately, I got my plain chips, but nothing irriates me more then the annoying response of ""If we had it, it would be out there.""  Bullsh!t! Your just to lazy to go look.  I know you have cases of chips in the back, so stop stocking your cups and get me some chips.

Aside from the snotty stocker guy, the other two people working there were wonderful.   The register guy wrapped one half of my sandwich for me to go, and served the other one for me to stay and eat in the resturant."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I am a HUGE scrapbooker, and this scrapbook store is probably the best one I have found here in the valley so far.  The selection here is huge, and the prices are fair and reasonable.  Lots of paper, ribbon, stickers and other wonderful scrapbooking items to choose from.  The staff is wonderful, and actually help you with anything you may need.  If you have layout questions, need help with getting the right ribbon, or just questions in general, they really take thier time to answer the question and help you!   

They also have a really good setup where if you put your name in the computer, you get monthly discounts, and an extra discount for your birthday.  I think once you spend $100 with the store, you also get an additional discount as well.  They keep a running total of how much you have spent in the computer under your name,and you get an additonal discount once you've hit your $100 mark.

The store also has a lab as well, and they hold classes regularly.   I think they charge for most classes, but there may be 1 or 2 that are free.  Check with store on the classes and charges.  If you do work in the lab, they will let you run a tab, so you dont have to pay every time you want to get something for your scrapbook.  

The store also has scrap night, for $15, which is pretty typical.  Usually run Friday and/or Saturday nights, and its a blast.  Hourly drawings, worth the $$, and its a lot of fun.

Here are the only negatives I could find about the store:

A) They charge $5 fee to use the lab.  I don't like paying for lab time, since most other scrapbook stores will let you use thier lab for free.   

B) I like to use the lab to scrapbook.  It gets me out of the house, I get to meet other scrapbookers, and I can get supplies that I need as I work.  Being the working professional woman that I am, the only free time I have to scrapbook is the weekends.  What I DONT like, is that getting into the lab is near impossible on the weekends.  Why?  Becuase when they hold classes, the lab is off limits to open scrapbookers like me.  What this means, is that I can shop, but if I am having a scrapbooking weekend, I can't go into the store, and Im stuck scrapping at home.  If theres a class going on, they will not allow you to go in and scrapbook off to the side.  I dont like that.

C)  They are closed on Sundays!  Argh!   I wish they would have Sunday hours, but for some reason, they dont."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I shop here on a semi regular basis because they are very close to my apartment.  Overall, I don't have a specific problem with this location, and do enjoy shopping here. There are plenty of perks, but overall I can't go higher then a 3 on this place.

the good parts is that they have an awesome deli with tons of great prepared dishes for sale.  I always end up buying something from their deli, and I like their dishes better then Fry's prepared foods.  Service is quick and efficient with little to no wait.  Bakery is slim pickings for stuff like breads and what not, but its not half bad.  Produce is always well stocked, and their meat and fish counter rocks!  They always have great stuff on sale like chicken breasts, stuffed fish and a random selection of stuff. Love their prices and staff.

The down side is that the register lines can be long and brutal.  I don't expect to not wait, but these lines get LONG. I feel like this is the one place that is so understaffed. I can get quick service anywhere in the store, but I end up loosing time in the checkout lines! It's not that the staff is slow, it's that the don't have enough registers open at any given time. Plus, they did away with the self check outs, and there's usually maybe one express line open if your lucky...plus, factor in the fact that there's always some illiterate douchebag with a cart full of stuff that goes through the one express lane and screws it up for everyone else!

Also, the parking lot can be somewhat of a mess.  I swear, the people I run into here are crazy!  People begging at the door for change or a smoke, idiot drivers who don't pay attention and act like it's a Nascar racing track, and whatever else runs in and out of here. I know it's not their job to patrol, but dang, nothing sucks more then running out to your car with a bag of groceries and getting approached by some homeless dude while your trying to get home in 115 degree heat and hoping your ice cream doesn't melt or your milk doesn't spoil.  Or going into the store and getting asked for change by a homeless lady with her two kids....They could probably use a security guard to keep the riff raff out for sure.  GET A SECURITY GUARD OUTSIDE ALREADY.

Overall, it's an okay store. I don't do all my grocery shopping here, but it is part of my short list of places to go.  Great deli, meat counter, produce and the staff is friendly overall, so I can't complain."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I was up in Scottsdale doing some shopping on Saturday, and decided to stop here and get something to eat. I love deli food, and figured this was the place to stop. 

I dont dislike this place.  I could (and would) take my mom here and probably have a good time.  Thats not my point. but, I found a few things that irked me, and I was torn between 3 and 4 stars.

When I walked in, I noticed its cafereria style deli.  You stand in line, order, and they scoop your food onto a plate and serve you.  The line was long, and if I was in a hurry, I would have turned around and left.  I stayed, because I wanted to try the food.

My first grave disapointment was not only the long line, but the menu overhead.  It seemed kind of McDonalds-ish, and slim.  I grabbed a menu and realized they have a ton more dishes that didnt appear to be overhead.  really?  why is that?  Delis are supposed to have huge menus!  argh.

Anyways, I didnt want a HUGE meal.  I wanted a light lunch, not a 10 pound pastrami sandwich for 10 million dollars.  After reviewing the menu, I decided to get the 3 Latkes (potato pancakes) for $5.95 and a drink.   I placed my order, and the service was nice enough. (no complaints there, really.)  It was awkward because I moseyed up to the register and paid, for a grand total of $8.04.  (ouch!)  

I mean, its a deli, and deli food aint cheap, but dam, thats a lot, considering Im not gettting waiter service, sit down treatment, and its not like your making it fresh for me from a batter on the grill.  You probably have some premade latkes that your reheating for me, and serving.  when they came out, thats kind of how they tasted.  They werent bad, but they were mostly greasy, and kind of floppy.  Usually, a good latke is more firm, and will have some ""grease"" from the grill, but this was more then that. Meh.

Anyways, seating was at your own risk.  Lots of big party tables, and a few scattered 2 tops.  I guess they anticipate lots of large 8 person parties to come here and dine? I kind of feel bad for taking up a  person table because theres no where else to sit.

This place isnt bad, and its a great alternative to Chompies.  I dont want to sound overly critical, but I feel like its got room for improvement.  Some of the food looked kind of sad, and considering how expensive it is, I think they could do a little bit more with presentation.  I mean, scooping me brisket out of a hotpan and charging me an arm and a leg seems kinda poopy, ya know?"
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I've been coming to this library on and off for the past few months since I moved into my new apartment.  I started coming here in the fall to check out books, but found myself here a lot after my computer died in December.  I got to know some of the features of this library, and I have to say, this is one of the nicer branches I've been too.

For starters, its located in the mall circle of Metro Center Mall.  Yes, I know what your thinking, why would I want to go there? Well, its the closest library, and its not in the mall itself, just in the service drive!!  (leave your bulletproof vests and guns at home for this one, okay?)

The library has two floors, and is pretty modern in layout and technology.  Lots of computers for kids and adults, meeting rooms, and a bunch of other cool stuff to boot.  They rent books, movies, CD's and have several other services here as well, including english classes and a few others.  You can rent a room for like $5 an hour if you want to have a cool meeting spot as well!

The staff here is pretty friendly, and will help you with just about anything.  I've had to ask the librarians before for assistance, and they haven't failed me yet.  Membership here is free, and you can get a card on the spot if you want to check something out.  Also, they have self checkout which is pretty neat as well, and you can renew stuff online if it's easier for you do it that way.'s 

The internet here is pretty quick, and there's like 25 or 30 computers to use here, but they fill up quick on Sundays, so get there when they open.   If your desperate, you can put in a PC reservation and get the next computer if you have to get online like I did.

Also, if you need a book or DVD and they don't have it at this branch, the librarians will look it up for you and tell you what branch you can pick it up from. Pretty cool, huh?

The library also has security guards here as well.  I don't know why, I mean it is Metro Center, but who know it could be such a rowdy place? LOL  There's one security lady that I see, and she's a bit snippy, BUT there's a hot security guy that works here, and we constantly make eyes at each other, so he's cool.  We keep checking each other out, so I guess its just a matter of time...(get it? checking each other out like books at the library?)   HAHAHA

Anyways, I gave an extra star for the sexy security guard, so it's all good!!! O, and if you go there have fun! Their closed on Fridays but open every other day of the week!"
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I came here yesterday after wanting to come here for some time, and am glad that I finally made it.  This zoo is way out on the west side of town, out in the middle of literally no where.  Its worth every mile of the drive, as the place is huge and has LOTS to see and do.

I spent $29 dollars on admission, and that got me into the whole park.  The place is huge, so make sure to get a map!  They have an extensive bird display, all sorts of wild animals, and a wonderful new aquarium.

Some of the animals were a sight to see, and you could almost walk up and pet them.  I was actually able to pet the Lllamas, and got up close and personal with a few other of the animals in there as well.  They have a wonderful bird feeding station that you can go in and feed the birds apples and they will come up and sit right on your arms and head.  

They have wild howling dogs witch I found so cute and wonderful to listen to, a Girraffe feeding station, lions, Emus, all sorts of deer and some of the ducks and birds wonder about the grounds as well.  I got up close and personal with Peacocks as well! The exotic birds and parrots are really pretty!

They also have a Koi pond and a beautiful aquarium as well.  The aquarium is part of the park and does not require seperate admission.  They have sharks, lobsters, all sorts of coral and see life here as well.  You can even go up and pet the stingrays as well.

Make sure to eat before you get here, as theres really nothing  close to the zoo before you arrive, and some of the food is pricy at the park. I made the mistake of not eating before I arrived, and had to grab a $4 hot dog after getting in since I was way hungry.  They do have a nice sit down resturant here in the park near the entrance & aquarium, but its a little pricy to just grab a bite to eat at.  They have a little snack shack that sells hot dogs and nachos, but its going to set you back a few bucks for medicore food at movie theatre prices.

Regardless of what side of town you live on, take the time to come here and visit.  Its not the most glamorous zoo, but it is quite extensive and worth the trip.  I drove 40 miles each way to visit here, and I would gladly go again.  Also, bring a few dollars in quarters so you can feed the girraffes, as they have little machines that sell you girraffe food for 50 cents for a handful of food.  

Its grate for kids and adults, and I consider it on the list of things to do in Phoenix that to me are worth the time and money for what you get..."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I came here today because I was in the area and wanted something different. I've heard about them before, but never been into their place until now.

It wasn't the worst, but honestly, I wasn't all that thrilled.  I was hoping for more.  When I walked in, the place was empty!  There was one guy sitting and eating in the corner.  I will say that its because today is Christmas Eve, and everyone's out doing other stuff getting ready for the holiday.

So, I walk in and go to the register to order.  I had a few questions since I'd never eaten here before, but the girl behind the register was inputting stuff in and asked me to hold on for a moment.  I waited a few minutes for her to finish, but it felt like forever.  I was hungry and just wanted to eat.  Anyways, she takes my order, and I went with one of their combos.  I got a Brisket sandwich, mac and cheese, along with a pop to drink.  

The food was done quickly, but I left feeling kind of let down.  The mac and cheese was soupy, and had quite a bit of pepper in it.  I ate about half and threw the rest away. Normally I would take something like that home and snack on it later, but I didn't care for it, so I chucked what I I didn't eat.  The Brisket itself was okay, but the BBQ sauce had no kick to it.  I don't mean that it was mild...but it had no taste.  Plus, they didn't put a lot of sauce on, so that half my sandwich didn't have BBQ sauce on it.  :-(

Normally, when I eat at a BBQ place, they have additional bbq sauces either in squirt bottles on the table, or in a vat somewhere in a central location for you to add on if you would like more.  There is also usually some kind of variety to choose from.  Tangy sauce, maybe a hotter bbq sauce, etc.  All I saw was a vat near the napkin area, but it wasn't labeled and I didn't trust putting in on my food.  I didn't know what it was.  I assume it was extra sauce, but I don't know that for sure since there wasn't a sign.  

Also, the place was FREEZING.  Look, I'm from Michigan and have a pretty thick skin for cold.  But, the last few days, its been quite cold outside, even for Arizona standards.  30 something degrees and night, with a high in the upper 50's to 60's during the day.  Most places have the heat on.  Well, not at Honey Bears.  No heat. I could feel that the cold had seeped in, and I wasn't wearing a coat, and wished I had.  fail.

Overall, I didn't like this location, but I am open to trying the other locations in the future, and hope to have a better experience next time."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I've been a customer of SRP since July of 2007 when I had to get electric service put in my name.  I fell in love with them from the start, and have nothing but awesome things to say about them.  

For starters their rates are much better then APS from what I have seen.  They have a variety of pricing options and plans for everyone no matter what your circumstance.

I personally have M Power and wish this feature was in Michigan where I moved from back in 2005.  Why?  because I can monitor my electric usage, and it saves me tons of money.  Did you know that people who use M Power use 20% less electricity then those that recieve a bill?  Why? Because you can monitor it all the time!  Plus, there's no bill!  I keep quite a high balance on my M power machine since electricity during the summer is much more expensive, and the winter months are cheaper on the electric bills and pocket book.

During the summer of 2010 (June through August), I found myself unemployed after getting downsized at my job of 5 years.   I was lost, and worried about finding new employment, and while I waited it out in the summer heat, I called SRP to see if there was anything I could do to save money on my electric bill while I found a new job and received unemployment.  They told me about a plan for people in my situation that allows people in my circumstance to receive a $17 monthly bill credit for up to 12 months while I find a new job.  You don't have to pay the $17 back, and when you go to the SRP machines to put money on, you receive the credit at the beginning of every month.  I did that for 3 months, and even though I keep a high balance it was the peace of mind knowing that they had my back.  (that was a total of $51 over the course of 3 months in electricity credits!  especially in July, thats like 2 free weeks of electric!)

I also had an outage in September of 2010 due to a meter problem.  I had a new M power box at my door within the hour, and a service man was at my door within 2 hours of that!  SRP completely handled the situation, and got me back up and running between the time I got home from work and the time I went to bed. Plus, their customer service people are always so nice and friendly.
.
I wish other states and electric companies would model themselves after SRP and how they run their electricity business.  So many options with pricing! I also LOVE M POWER. If other states would even pick up something like M Power, we could save so much energy!

Keep up the good work SRP, and you always make me happy!"
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"This is an Asian mall that has quite a few Asian stores and restaurants in it along with a few other businesses as well.  The place is always packed, and the grocery store in here seems to have a big draw to it.   Every time I'm in the mall, the grocery store is packed!

I don't come here often, but when I do it's not a half bad experience.  I walk through the mall, check out the grocery store and then go home.  They also have periodic fairs every now and then, which is kinda cool.  There's a few restaurants in here that I have seen that actually look kinda good to eat at.  I was in here Christmas day, as I usually am, and saw a Chinese place I wanted to eat at for Christmas dinner. We passed and went to a buffet across town instead.  

I will say, that I did have a horrible experience in the food court here on Sunday.  My friend and I came in here after a movie to check the place out and were starving.  It was only 2PM, and we didn't want a full meal quite yet, but wanted more of a snack.  We hit the food court in hopes of picking up an egg roll, or a small cup of soup just to kill off the hunger.  What a mistake THAT was.

For starters, the tables in the food court were a MESS.  Disgusting MESS.  Every table had half eaten food on it in dishes that looks like it had been sitting there for quite a while.  It appeared that if you ordered a full meal here in the court, you got it in actual ""real"" dishes and not Styrofoam.  down side to that?  You can't throw it away and it has to be cleared by someone who works there.  Fine, unless no one cleans up the food court, which was the case when we were there. We actually found a table that didn't have a zillion empty dishes on it, and it was LOADED FULL of sauce stains, crumbs, and all kinds of garbage from who ever had eaten there before us.  Disgusting.

We sat down and ordered a plate of 4 egg rolls, and the place we ordered from said he would clean the tables for us.  10 minutes later, he still had not done so, and I had to go ask him to wipe down the table for us.  We dumped some Windex on it, and then left.

If it hadn't been that it was Christmas Day, I would have never eaten here at the food court.  It was disgusting.  But, it was to late at that point, as we had already paid and didn't feel like embarrassing ourselves and asking for it to go, or asking for our money back.

I only come here once a year, and that's about all I can handle for this place. It's just not my style, and after the bad food court experience, I don't really plan on returning any time soon."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I came here as part of my trip to Cleveland and really enjoyed seeing the wonderful zoo and all the animals that are here.  The displays are wonderful, and I am glad I got the chance to come.

For starters, the admission is reasonable, only $14.25 for adults.  Parking is free with plenty of spaces.  Upon walking in, I was given a map and took a few minutes to figure out which way to go.  I started with the elephant exhibit which was amazing!  I walked through the first area which was the outdoor pen.  None of the elephants were there.  I then walked through the indoor part to find the elephants eating and getting ready for their day!  I was able to get up close and personal with them, which I absolutely loved!

Then, off to the Flamingos!  Love these guys.  Their always up for photos, and I love the pink colors. Up next, I fed the birds. I purchased a cup of nectar for $2 and with some prompting, was able to feed them right then and there!  They were absolutely hilarious!  Two birds would come up, and one would push the other out of the way with their foot to get nectar!  

I then walked around and got to see a bunch of other animals in no particular order.  Lions, tigers and bears, along with Giraffes, birds and fish.  I did take the tram down after walking through the monkey exhibit, which was fun to do as the monkeys were actively swinging from the ropes.

At this point, I'm a bit worn down, and starting to feel the burn from hiking it for almost two hours.  There's plenty of benches to sit on, which I did to regain my strength.  But here's where I dock a star. First, the tram only runs from the Monkey part down to the entrance.  There's a second part the the tram runs, but due to construction, they weren't shuttling people up and down from that part.  BOO.  Also, none of the food or water stands were open, and I was there for a good part of the day.  Not that I'm looking to stuff my face, but a lemonade would have been awesome!

Also, I think I may have skipped an exhibit or two by sheer accident. I realized on the way out that there was the jungle thing admission, but I was so run down I didn't have the energy to see it.  Also, the gift shop seems to be geared mostly towards kids, and I didn't by a thing.  A LOT of stuffed animals and coffee cups, for sure.  I was looking for something on the smaller end, and what am I going to do with stuffed animals?  Maybe some magnets or picture frames would do.

Anyways, I had a blast and spent 3 full hours here.  I would go again weather permitting and was worth the price of admission."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"This is the new and improved IHOP that just opened after the new year due to the light rail construction.  They built this place from the ground up, and it looks fabulous inside and out.  IHOP seems to be doing a lot in regards to upgrading its properties, as this is not the first time I've seen a brand spanking new IHOP here in the valley over the past 2-3 years.

I came here early on a Saturday morning and was seated right away.  Place is new and clean, and the staff was really nice and friendly.  I went with the chocolate chip pancakes, hash browns and bottomless coffee.  My bill was $11.77 after tax, and I really enjoyed myself. I got 4 pancakes, but I should have gone with 2! I couldn't finish them all!  I paid my bill and left before the food coma set in.

The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was for two reasons.  First, when I got seated, my table didn't have any silverware. I didn't realize this until I got my coffee and went to stir in the cream and sugar.  I looked around and realized that non of the tables in my section had any silverware either!  (the section was empty except for me).  I finally spotted a set of silverware a few tables down, and grabbed that so I could use the spoon to stir.  

Secondly, I had my computer with me, and the girls at the front gave the password to get online.  I put it into my computer and the internet said ""limited connectivity."" I was somewhat flustered with this as I did have a few things online that I wanted to address while I was eating my breakfast.  I tried a few times during my stay and was never able to get online.  

While I was eating my breakfast, a family of 6 sat down from me. He tried to get online with his smartphone and was unable to connect as well. He had the same problem I did. The password was good, but he couldn't bring up the internet. 

I don't know why they don't just have a password free environment. I imagine this would cause more stress for the servers trying to help people get online, and it's really annoying since they aren't IT people. It seems like they have some sort of problem going on with their internet, and no on there could get on.  They need to A) drop the pass word stuff, but more importantly B) figure out why the internet isn't working in the restaurant for customers.  It's frustrating!  Also, the servers do a good job and its not fair to them to stand there and try to play IT while people are also eating there food.

Overall, I had a good experience, and the few things that were aggravating were small and can be worked out.  Will be back in the future for more good breakfast!"
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"So, 5 guys just opened this location a few weeks back and I figured I would check it out.  I've eaten here twice now, sheerly out of the fact that its in the same shopping complex as my office.

In the two times that I've been here, I've gone with the same thing-small cheeseburger with some toppings on it.  The burgers are better then I remember when I first tried 5 guys a few years ago, which is better then the first time I went back when I lived in Mesa.  I didn't have a good experience dining there and haven't been back since. Until now.

I will say the burgers are better then I remember.  But, overall, I'm just not impressed with them as a whole. Here's why:

For starters, I find them to be ridiculously overpriced.  I got a small pop and a cheeseburger and it was $7.42.  No, thats not horrible, but all my co-workers and I agreed that they are expensive.  If I had gone with a full meal (meaning gotten the fries) it would have cost me well over 10-12 dollars.  That's for a small cheeseburger!  No combo meals here, everything is a la carte.

Secondly, the wait both times has been tremendous. The first time I waited almost 15 minutes for my order! Today the wait was about the same.  There were 10 orders ahead of us, and we were all in a rush to get our food.  I know it sounds crazy, but they seem to have a big grill with lots of people working behind the counter, and they seem to make the burgers as their ordered, but in batches.  I can't understand how they can get that behind. I mean, there's a guy standing there making like 10 burgers at time, and like 3 or 4 guys on the grill.  Why the wait then?

Thirdly, everything comes in a brown bag. Even if your dining in.  I don't get it. Why can't I get a plate or something? Especially if I had gotten fries, it just seems like a weird way to eat and serve food.

Lastly, the seating here is okay, but when we were there during a rush, there was a limited about of tables.  There were 4 of us and we were unable to dine in, so we got our food to go.  They have a mixture of high bar stool type tables that seat 3, and some 4 tops for seating as well.   If the place was busy, like it was today at lunch, there really wasn't a place to sit for all 4 of us.  Not a huge problem, but it did damper our experience there as we were all hoping to dine in and sit together.

On the upside, they do have peanuts galore for you to snack on while your waiting, and one of those really cool pop machines that has a million different flavors to choose from.

Overall, its just okay. I'm not unimpressed, but I'm not over the moon about this place either."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I live really close to Bookman's, actually within walking distance from my apartment.  It's not a half bad place, and carries an enormous amount of books.  I shop here from time to time, and its not a half bad place. They carry CD's movies, musical instruments and an assortment of other items as well.

Overall, the store is a good place to shop, but I'm not the biggest fan of this place. Yes, it's local business, and that's why I shop here from time to time, but I don't consider it my ""home"" bookstore for a variety of reasons.  Please read below for the good, bad and ugly about this place.

The good:
*wide selection of items new and used.  Books, CD's, movies, instruments and much much more. It's definitely local business and I feel better buying from here then other big box stores. You can get a huge selection of new or used items at fair prices.

The bad:
*store feels tired and old.  Not that it's going to turn me away, but has a darker feel to it them most.  Also, I feel like the selection is more fiction based then non fiction. 

*I don't think they give you a store credit for trades, just cash. I like to put my money towards re shopping at the same place, but I don't think they do that here. I could be wrong, but that's my knowledge.

The ugly:
*they have a security guard here at all times. wait, its an actually police officer. I don't know why, but it's kind of intimidating to walk in and cruise past a cop. I've been to other bookstores and they don't seem to have this problem, so I'm not sure what that's all about.  Are gang bangers suddenly cruising through a bookstore and having turf wars?  is there a serious stealing problem here? what gives?  To much riff raff?

*also, even though the staff is helpful, there's a sense of arrogance depending on who helps you.  Are they all this way? no, just some. I feel like I'm at a snobby coffee bar when I shop here.  It's the trendy mentality that gets me at times.  Look, I like to support these places, but it gets old when I really need help finding a book or have questions about something and I feel like I should already know the answers to my own questions.  It doesn't happen often, but there is a vibe at times that I can't shake.  

*one time I came here and there was some sort of star wars convention going on. Even though I'm not a star trek fan, it was fun to watch adults and kids having a good time. Good to see that their doing events like this.

Overall, I can't hate on the bookstore, and I say if you live close, shop here. It's just not on my short list of places I absolutely love, that's all.  Huge selection, great prices with wall to wall everything."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I love Smashburger, really I do.  I've been putting off going to this location, and finally got around to getting in there tonight. Unfortunately, I had a bad service experience, and, even though I will probably return, I'm upset after tonight with this specific location.  Here's why:

I got here around 5:30 and went with the all american burger with a haystack of onion rings.  There wasn't a whole lot of people in the place when I got there, but it soon started to fill up after I sat down and started to eat.

Halfway through my meal, I had finished my drink and needed a refill. I also figured since the onion rings were small, I would also grab a fork while I was up at the beverage station.  Mind you, the place was full at this point. 

I stood up, took my purse, grabbed my drink and walked to the beverage station.  As I turned around, I saw one of the bus boys clearing my table. My burger wasnt even half eaten.  I started to go after him to leave my food, and he did not hear me.  He walked right by me with my dinner and continued on into the kitchen.  I was FURIOUS.  I had just paid $10 for a full meal, and this kid was taking it away.  (it was half the burger and half the fries, not the whole burger.)

While he walked into the kitchen, I grabbed one of the burger girls and told her what was going on.  I explained that I had gone to the drink station to get more pop and this kid took away my food and I wasnt done.  She told me to hold on a second, and grabbed the kid (who appeared to be in high school) and told me to tell him what I had told her.  I explained to him that I was NOT DONE EATING and he had taken away the rest of my dinner.  He apologized, as did the server.  I was still upset, and told him I didnt want an apology, I wanted the the rest of my dinner!

They offered to cook me up another burger and fries.  I decided to pass, as I was mostly full from what I had already eaten.  I asked them to get the manager and the kid ran in the back of the kitchen and never came back out.  I wanted them to know what had happened, so that way they would know.

I left and called the store when I got home and talked to the manager. I explained that I was upset, as anyone would be, and had wanted to talk to her about it in person, but the kid who went to get the manager never reappeared. It was upsetting for me all the way around.

The manager apologized and took my name and number.   They said that if I come in, I can have a gift certificate for a free meal there, which is what I had wanted in the first place.

Anyways, even though I love the food here, I dont know that I will be back to this specific location any time soon, due to this whole thing."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"Ok, so we all know moving sucks.  Especially moving ones self...even if it is acoss town.

Anyways, I had to get a 10 foot uhaul for my move from Chandler to Mesa.  I was moving a whopping 12 miles, but I just needed a 10 foot truck to do one trip with to get my mattress, bedroom furniture, couch, and other random stuff to the new apartment.  Fine.

So, I go in the night before I needed it and made a reservation for the truck.  Fine.  I go back the next morning, to get the truck, and this is where I get upset.  I'm already stressed out from moving, its hot as heck outside, and I want to get this overwith.  Im the only person in the store and its 8 AM.

So, I go to the counter.  A guy helps me, who's name I will not list in this review, even though I remember it.  He's filling out the stuff in the computer, and asks me for a secondary phone #.  I told him I did not have one, and the only one I have is my cell number. Well, I guess that was a huge problem to him, and he basically snapped at me and said ""look, I need a second phone number for you.  I'm just trying to fill out the paperwork!  Just give me your work number, okay?""  

Crap. Now I've been scolded by the uhaul man for not having a second phone #, and clearly this is really screwing up his day, really bad.   Now, I'm the bad guy.  So, what did I do?  I gave him a fax number.  Yea, call THAT and reach me.

So, then, they go to get me my truck.  Well, guess what?  It has no gas, because someone siphoned it out overnight! So the guy says to me ""did you want to wait for 15 minutes for me to gas the truck, or did you just want to take it empty?""  Why would I want to drive a uhaul that has zero gas in it???  So I can be stranded a mile down the road, and make this day longer?????  So, I waited for him to gas it.

Now, while I was waiting, and cranky counter man was gassing the truck up, two other employees waltz in.  I asked if they worked here, and they said that they are uhaul employees, but they are finance from corporate.  nice.  

See, I normally dont get mad, but I was so stressed from moving, and after getting scolded, I had to complain to someone.  So, I tell finance that counter boy is very cranky this morning and scolded me for not having a secondary phone number, and I dont appriciate it.  They were like ""uh, ok thanks.""

Anyways, cranky counterboy comes back with the truck, which was nice by the way.  Clean, fast, and most importantly, with gas!  I take the truck, move my stuff, and return it.  I think he got told that I complained becuase I got a few bucks off the dolly rental that I had....plus, he was in a MUCH better mood this time.

I gave this place only 2 stars for the cranky counter boy.  But, the trucks were clean and neat."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"So, my friend Angie and I were looking for a casual place to dine on Saturday night, and I suggested we try Pizza a Metro.  I've seen that a lot of fellow Yelpers have gone here, and its recieved quite a few reviews.  

So, I call the place to confirm where they are located, and what time they are open until.  A nice gentleman with an Italian accent answered the phone, and was so friendly and helpful!  I loved it!  

So, I drive there, and like the gentleman said, he was right off the expressway next to a circle K.  What shocked me at first was a few things.  First, its a tiny little parking lot, and its shared with a circle K.  I found this interesting.  Fortunately, there was parking available, so I waited for my friend to arrive.  The second surprise that I had was just how small this place was.  Interesting.  I guess if you had a larger party (more then 4 people) you would definately NEED to call in a reservation, as its a very limited seating arrangement.

When my friend finally arrived, all the seats were taken, and I was greeted by the gentleman with the thick Italian accent.  He told me that it would be about a 7 minute wait, so my friend and I waited outside in the parking lot.   The wait ended up being more about 10 minutes, maybe 15 tops.  Not bad.

When we were seated, we really liked the place.  Theres a firebrick oven where people were cooking pizzas.  There was also other workers that you could see preparing other foods.  Somewhat of an open kitchen feel.  the service was great.  I believe this place is owned and operated by this Italian family.  they most be brothers, because periodically throughout the evening, they were speaking in Italian to each other.  I think it really added to the evening, and made the place feel much more authentic.

We ended up ordering our food, and even tho I was not extremely hungry, my friend was.   I went with a Cesar Salad, and my friend went with the Cheese Ravioli.  We were given some complimentary appitizers which were bread chunks and red sauce. Tasty!  We both ordered pops, which were brought out and poured for us...but they were from those 20 ounce pop bottles that you would get at a local store...not from a fountian. I found this interesting.

Angie really enjoyed her Ravioli, but I felt like my salad was a little soggy.  Sitll edable, just a little to much dressing.  The food here seems to be good, and I think its also the ambiance and guys that run the show that make dining here worthwhile.  I would bring friends or family here who are in from out of town, becuase I think its one of those more authentic experiences.

Anyways, the service was wonderful.  Truely a gem, and much more fun and authentic then most places I have been for pizza and pasta lately."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"So, my comforter needed to be cleaned.  I have a washer and dryer in my apartment, but the comforter I have is huge and bulky.  When I have to wash stuff like this, I usually take it to the laundry mat since it's way easier to get it clean then me trying to stuff it in my washing machine and having it come out all mangled.  I prefer to have it done in one of the larger machines since it comes out cleaner and it dries a heck of a lot better then in my washer and dryer at home.

I haven't been to this location since I first moved into my apartment a couple months ago when I was doing a lot of cleaning and unpacking around the time that I moved.  I usually average going to the laundry mat about twice a year now to clean big ticket items that don't work at home.  So, off I came this morning in the rain with my beloved comforter!

This place is a card based system.  I don't like the card systems because they are only good for that specific location (obviously) and the card always always always ends up with a balance no matter how you cut it.  If you lose the card, you lose the balance you have on it, so you end up having to get a new card when you go in.  I prefer dumping quarters in myself, but hey, that's just me.

This place isn't glamorous by any stretch of the imagination.  I don't know what it is with Phoenix and laundry mat's, but I have yet to find one that is really nice and clean! This one is no exception. I mean, its not the dirtiest one I've been too, but it definately is in need of some attention.  Broken tiles on the floor, the bathroom is horrible, and it looks like the place just isn't kept up. I know, I know, if they keep it clean and pretty then laundry costs more, bla bla bla, but c'mon! Take care of your stuff man! ugh!

They do sell laundry detergent here, full size bags and small individual packs as well. Since I have a huge Costco detergent thing at home, I don't drag it in for one load since it's to heavy. I buy the single pack of power detergent here for a $1 and use that for whatever I happen to be washing (rugs, comforters, etc.)  They used to have a machine on the wall that you can put coins into and buy them, but I guess it's broken so you have to purchase it from the attendant! They also have a bill changer here, but I don't trust it, so I bring my own singles and fives when I'm coming here to load my card with money.

The washers and dryers here work just fine. I was in and out in an hours time, and that's awesome. It only cost me a couple bucks to wash my comforter, so I'm all set now.

Just don't go here expecting it to be visually fabulous. I wish the laundrymats here were in better shape, but hey, I guess its not a big thing so I am over it.  Will be back probably in 6 months time to wash more stuff that I can't do at home!"
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"ok, so for some reason, my usual wifi spot/coffee shop was not open last night, or this morning.  weird. so, I was forced to take matters into my own hands, and find a new place to plug my computer in and drink coffee until my 'usual' spot decides when to reopen.

so, I thought I had seen this place from the road.  Its on Southern, in a strip mall, tucked away.  This place is a cute little treasure!  Its well decorated.  Has an artsy feel to it.  Has artists paintings for sale on the wall, with some really cool couches to sit on and get your drink on.  Theres also stainless steel tables in here as well, which I love!  kind of a modern chic feel.  Comfortable classy atmosphere without the stuffiness!
 Clean, eclectic, without being dirty or drab.  

They have all your usual coffee shop drinks with a decent range in prices and sizes.  THey have ice cream shakes, italian sodas, organic coffees and some teas as well for good measure.

The location itself is not large.  Rather small, but well done with ample seating and space.  They also have a few outdoor tables and chairs as well!

They have 'free' wifi, but only after you make a purchase.  I went with a choclate muffin, since I'm a little overcaffinated at the moment.  I was given the password and login info after I paid for my muffin.

Now, here is where they loose a star.  First, I had trouble logging onto thier network.  It wouldnt even show up on my wireless connection screen.  I asked the lady behind the counter, and she was mildly helpful, but she really didnt know what to do.  Mind you, I am primarily here to get on the internet, okay?  So she tells me that sometimes the connection here is weird, and said that sometimes the signal here is bad, and to move tables and try the 'otherside of the shop.'  Ive never heard of one side of a business getting wifi, and the other not.

So, I switch sides of the (already small) shop.  For some retarded reason, it worked.  weird.  now I am on the internet typing this review.

Also, as a side note, they lost a few points for another reason, and i will explain.  Normally, I dont usually pick up/evesdrop on others conversation while out.  Honestly, I really could care less, and unless its a screaming match, Im probably not listening.

When I walked in, these ladies were gossiping about something. Someone borrowed $10, and this one lady was pissed off about it becuase her friend that had borrowed the $10 hadnt paid her back.  These two women are discussing it, and honestly, I just thought it was such a personal conversation to be having in the middle of a coffee shop while your working.  

Anyways, I really do like this place, despite the weird wifi connection, and most likely will be returning.  This place supports the training of Domestic Violence victims...Please go here and get coffee, as your money goes to a good cause."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"So, I had to get away for a few days, and decided that Cleveland was a quick easy location.  I scoured hotels.com and found that this place was not only reasonably priced, but in a great location in regards to food, shopping, the expressway and downtown.  I booked my stay, and off I went.

When I arrived, I was happy to get here.  The hotel isn't anything fancy. It's definitely clean and safe, but if you want a 5 star Hilton, keep driving.  I arrived at 12:30, and even though check in time is 2PM, the staff was nice enough to let me check in early!  I liked this because I've been to other hotels and they were much more rigid about check in time.  Plus, I was a bit tired from driving and really wanted to rest and relax.

I also had requested a second floor room for security purposes, since I was traveling alone.  They accommodated this as well, which made me even happier.  I had the two queen beds reserved, and when I walked into the room, I was happy to see that it was in great shape!  They had a flatscreen TV with 42 channels, free WIFI with an awesome full signal, and a great little setup going on here with a desk area as well.

But, here's where I dock a star. I lumped it all together because I was really happy with the staff AND my stay here overall.  First, the room I booked was wonderful, but came without a coffee maker. I didn't realize this, and I guess for a few extra bucks a night I could have reserved a different room.  No, I can live with walking across the parking lot to get some coffee when needed, but coffee is kind of a big deal to me in the morning.  The girl at the desk said that normally they have a few extra machines to ""check out"" for people who want it, but they didn't have any available.  Boo.

Secondly, the socket in the bathroom counter area must have reset itself because after I had taken a shower that night, I was unable to turn on my hairdryer.  I tried to reset it myself, but was unable to do so.  The next morning when I was on my way out, the nice maintenance man took care of it for me, so it did resolve itself.  Thirdly, the toilet did have to be manually reset because it was running after I had used it. It was only this one time my first night, and no I didn't complain about it because I fixed it myself!

On the bonus side, the desk is always staffed 24/7. I had great experiences here, and every morning they had out a baggie breakfast to people!  You get a bottle of water, a fresh apple, and your choice of muffins.  I went with the Chocolate muffin bag, so I really liked that!  Also, I received daily room service, so my beds were made, towels were restocked and everything was put back in order.

I was very happy with my stay here.  I felt safe and secure, and will gladly return to Red Roof on my future visits to Cleveland. Thank you Red Roof, you really made an awesome impression!"
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"So, during December my computer died not once, but twice!  The hard drive went out on it, and after trying to get it fixed by a friend, I finally accepted that it was toast.  I wasn't really prepared for this to happen, as I had anticipated it lasting another year before replacing it.  But, such is life, and I guess it was time for the computer to go.

Mind you, I've never made a major purchase from Fry's electronics. I've been here in the past  for smaller purchases, but nothing more then here and there. Being that I was in the market again for a computer, and since things have changed since I last purchased a computer several years ago, I needed to refresh myself with what was out there.  (not just computer wise, but even the retail landscape has changed dramatically as well.)

I did some shopping around at Costco, Best Buy, and after a friend accompanied me here, I decided that Fry's had the selection and price that I was looking for.  I came in for my purchase on Wednesday night, because their New Years sale was ending. I was down to two computers that I had my eye on, and figured it was time to purchase before the sale ended.

The guy who helped me was awesome.  Total tech guy who totally new his stuff.  I was impressed with his knowledge. I showed him the two models that I wanted, and asked him which one would be better for me.  After explaining the differences, he said that either model will do me fine for a laptop, and that the $50 price difference was really up to me. He said that the cheaper model was the way to go, and that for $50 LESS I was not going to see a major speed difference for what I was getting.

He went back and grabbed the computer and had it at the register after I finished wandering the store.  He also told me that if I purchased Microsoft I could get it for $89 instead of the $120 that it would cost me if I waited until the 60 days ran out and they charge you. I said that I'm not a huge word user, and would pass.  

He was really educated and filled in a LOT of blanks for me that I couldn't have filled in myself.  I had a really positive experience here, and I feel like Fry's is the new Best Buy for me.  Plus, even though Costco has great prices, your on your own with buying and hoping its every thing you need. Plus, I've found that they rotate stock a lot at Costco and what you see today may not be there in a month. (trust me, I tried. The computer I had my eye on in early December there is not for sale through them anymore.  They rotated and put out an entirely different stock when I went back to purchase around New Years.

Even tho Costco seems to have a better warranty and tech support offer on their computers then Fry's, their stock rotates to fast and if you don't buy it within a short window of time, you may not get the make and model that you want.

Overall, had a great experience here and I would make another computer purchase from Fry's again."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"On occasion, I have to stop at the car store to get stuff for my vehicle.  Granted, I'm not exactly a motorhead who works on cars, but I do buy stuff that I need.  Stuff like Windshield wipers, washer fluid, airfresher, and occasional car cleaners that I cannot find elsewhere.  So, I go to places like this.

I will say, I am not a fan of Autozone after the experiences that I have had here.  I've never gone in to get anything complicated, and its usually off the list that I mentioned earlier...washer fluid, wipers, etc.  All stuff that doesnt require assistance to find or get.

Every single time I have gone in here, Ive walked out frustrated.  If its not from the craptastic lack of service, then its from standing in line for 10  minutes to be told that I need to go to a different register. Every time its another knot in my stomach.

The last time I was here, was on Saturday.  The wiper blades on my Jeep were shot.  They died a long time ago, and with my road trip coming up, along with monsoon season, I wanted working wiper blades.  I have done this before, and its not my first time.  I'm well aware of how to purchase these things.  For wiper blades, usually they have a book hanging with every single make and model of vehicle.  You look up your specific vehicle, it tells you what size blades you need, and then you purchase said blades.  

Well, when I walked in I was going to just run back and look at the book myself....customer service here is shoddy, and I can usually find it myself quicker.  But this time, I was actually greeted by a very cute guy at the door.  I told him what was going on, and he looked up my vehicle in the computer for me.  Told me I needed the 21 inch blades, and walked me over.  

Everything was going so well!!  Then he told me he has a few brands to choose from.  I told him I wanted the cheapest brand, becuase A) my car is a lease, and I will be trading it in this fall, and B) its Arizona, and we don't get a whole lot of rain here.  He tried to talk me out of the cheap blades.  ($4.99 per blade versus the next brand up, $9.99 each)
He was like ""you don't want the cheap brand. They don't last, just get the better ones, thier worth the money.""  Ok, but I dont want to spend the extra $10 on stupid wiper blades!!  

I understand what he was saying, but I really didn't want or need the fancy wipers by Rain-X.  I wanted something cheap and reasonable. I could tell he was getting a little frustrated with me, but I'm sorry, I want what I want.  If I lived in a state that had 4 seasons, trust me, I would have upgraded and gotten the fancier, more expensive wipers.  But, its really not necessary out here.

I will say, that after I paid, he came out and put the wiper blades on my Jeep.  I loved that he did that!!   Honestly, I wish I could find another auto parts store in the valley. I really don't care for Autozone all that much, but its so close to my house, I guess I just go."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I've been shopping at Costco for years, and it's probably one of my favorite places to go.  They have a little bit of everything, and I can usually find what I need here. But, this location itself seems to make me sad and depressed, for a variety of reasons. It's just not my favorite store. I'll tell you why.

For starters, The reason I have it 3 stars instead of 5 is the staff.  They aren't rude, but I've had better service. I usually hit the customer service counter every so often, and that's where I feel like I've gotten the blow off.  A handful of times I went there because they didn't send me my coupon book to know what's on sale.  I will usually go to the counter and grab a book so I can add or subtract from my shopping list depending on what I need and what's on sale.  

One time I asked the girl about the coupon books because I still don't get them in the mail and she didn't have any at the counter. Her response?  ""well, we can't guarantee that you get a coupon book and we don't have any here at the counter.  Sorry, you need to look online.""  She didn't even make an effort to check my account, inform me of when a new set will come in, or anything.  She continued on with her paperwork and that was that.

Look, I'm not a stickler about it, but in years past Costco has been pretty good about mailing me coupon books so I know whats on sale that month. If I don't get one, I grab one at the counter. If push comes to shove, the people will usually look it up to make sure my address is current to ensure that it's getting to the right address. Apparently, not here!  I guess it's to much work for them!

I've had other similar situations with the staff here as well, kind of getting the blowoff.  Another time I went to print some pictures and their photo machine went down.  3 days later the guy told me that I'm better off sending them to another location.  I asked if he could forward the pictures to the Deer Valley store, and he said that he wasn't able to do that, so I need to go home and upload them to that stores machine from my home computer.  I'm not suggesting that he's lying, but I just am so irritated that I had to wait 3 days to figure this out. I would call, and they would say the machines under repair and home to be back online by 5.  Then, it wasn't and they kept me waiting and calling until the guy finally called me at home and told me that it looks like its going to be a little bit longer before it's fixed and to resubmit.

Overall, I love Costco, but this store just isn't my favorite. Plus, sometimes the bathrooms have been in disrepair with at least one toilet out of service, if not more.  Yes, they are clean and well maintained, but something's always out of service when I'm in there. Either a toilet or two, a sink is down, something.  I still go here because its closet to home and easy to get to, and overall it's not that horribly bad.  Just a mediocre staff with some minor flaws, that's all."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I've been coming here on and off for the past few years, and I have to say, I absolutely love it, for a million different reasons.  Why and how you ask?  Here, let me make a list:

Pros:
-Plenty of shopping, more upscale, outdoorsy mall with plenty of places to shop and eat at.  They have the cheesecake factory, zinburger, true food, capitale grille and several other places to eat and hang out at.  You can eat for $10 or $100 a person here.....no ones excluded! You don't have to break the bank to enjoy a good meal.

-easily walkable with plenty of shopping.  Sacks Fifth Ave, Polo, and plenty of other stores to wander through for all budgets.  Some places will have price tags that make your eyes pop out, and others are more affordable that won't hurt your pocket book.

-You can park here and walk across the way to the Harkins theatre which is AWESOME!  As long as you don't park in the hourly parking, you can shop, dine and grab a movie all in one afternoon, at the same place, without having to move your car.  The harkins theater is one of those dine in theaters, so you can even eat there!  I know you can park closer to the theater in a garage, but you can also park in the back  end of the Biltmore, take a short walk, and save a few pennies on parking if you'd like, along with get some much needed exercise.

CONS:
-The only MAJOR downside to this place is the parking situation.  When I started coming here, it was not like this, but they changed it about a year, maybe two ago.  HORRIBLE.

The parking situation has become a serious turnoff to me.  I think they've always had valet, but the front part of the parking lot (facing camelback-in front of the cheesecake factory) is now entirely a pay by the hour set up.  *some* of the restaurants will validate for 2 hours of free parking if you ask, but if you eat, hang out and do some shopping, I can see how spending slightly more then hours here is possible.  Or, if you eat here, walk around and then go to the Harkins theatre across the street, FORGET IT.  

I noticed last week that if you leave your car there for more then 4 hours, its something ridiculous like $16!!!  If you validate, you may save a few bucks, but your still going to pay out the nose.  Lost ticket?  $16!!!!!!   

The only ""free"" parking is in the way back of the mall.  You have to circle around the Capitale Grill, park in the poverty section, and then walk through the mall area to get where your going.  If your in a time crunch, you will most likely want to do Valet, or just pay the stupid fees.  I've come here to eat lunch, and you can't find a place to park.  You can only hope to either get validated, or pray that you stopped at the ATM before you got here to pay your way out.  I have an hour lunch, so I don't really have time to circle to the back, park, and walk through the mall.

I wish they hadn't done that.  When its hot outside in July, and I'm going to the cheesecake factory, I sometimes regret coming here because of how they screwed up the parking situation.

Overall, I would recommend this mall to anyone."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I've had this on my list of places to try for a while now, and since I'm in this part of town for the next few days, I wanted to stop and try it out.  I came here for lunch today, and had a really good time.

Pulling in, I decided to do lunch instead of dinner because I figured it would be a lighter crowd, and to some degree it was. I mean, it wasn't packed, thank goodness, but people were coming in like crazy!  Quite impressive at the heavy flow of traffic for a Saturday lunch hour.

I came in and asked the girl at the front how it works here.  She went through how I stand in line, and place my order at the counter and they make the food while I order.  There's also a HUGE selection of cold beer as you walk through line that's on ice, along with a great selection of cold side items to go with whatever you eat.

I took my time ordering at the register, and felt really comfortable taking my time.  No rush or pressure to ""hurry up"" and I had a lot of questions about their menu.  They had 3 different types of brisket, and I asked what the difference was between all three.  The girl told me that one was lean, one was not, and I forget what the third one was.  You can go with a half pounder type meal, or a smaller sandwich which is what I had wanted.  I went with the Moist Brisket, creamed corn, and a medium drink.  Total bill was just 9 and change.

I got my food and went to take a seat. Everything here is picnic table style, so your going to end up sitting next to strangers, which I'm fine with.  They have BBQ sauce, hot sauce and one or two other items at each end of the picnic tables. If your stuck in the middle, I don't know how you would get the BBQ sauce if its clear at the other end.  The Brisket itself was AWESOME! Most, tender and definitely awesome! I totally loved how it tasted, and everything was just right.

They also have a HUGE hand washing station for when your done eating.  Why do I love this?  First, BBQ is messy! You get your hands kinda gross from the sauce and who wants to go into the bathroom just to wash your hands? They have 4 or 5 different nozzles and the water is nice and warm..soap and towels to! right there out in the open!  I love it.

Here's why I deducted a star. It's going to sound SO DUMB but I think you'll get it. First, there wasn't really any BBQ sauce on the sandwich itself. That's fine because the meat tasted perfect without it.   Normally, at other BBQ places, there's a selection of a few different sauces to choose from if you want to dress your meat with sauce. Rudy's only had 2.  Regular and spicy.  Okay, I'll take that. 

Here's the catch. The sauce is IMPOSSIBLE to get out of the container! They have this weird nozzle on the sauce container and you must use both hands to get it out...including pounding on the bottom of the bottle and turning it 100% bottoms up!  I know what your thinking...the bottle must be empty, right? NO ITS 100% FULL.  I got so irritated with it, that I just stopped putting sauce on! I want more sauce! Why does it have to be a major project?   Eveyrtime I tried to sauce my sandwich, it became a huge bottle beating project!  Basically, they need better nozzles that let more sauce out so I don't have to break the dam thing to put it on my sandwich! argh!!!!!

Overall, I would 100% recommend this place! GO EAT HERE.  Definitely worth the drive!  They even have a little store in the front where you can buy stuff like BBQ sauce and other stuff for your home too!"
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I've been coming to the Arabian Horse show for a long time now, and let me tell you, this is by far the coolest thing going on in Arizona in the middle of February that you just cannot miss!  2400 Arabian and half horses competing for 10 days is no small feat, let me tell you.

This show has been at Westworld for a long time now, long before I ever discovered this event. There's 11 arenas of competition going on, from Western Pleasure, reining, saddle seat and a whole lot more.  Just about every possible competition goes on here for horses and riders, and the best of the best will show here.  The riders do end up winning cash prizes and its a national show, so the awards really mean a lot to the  barns and riders competing.

Overall, there's 11 rings of competition going on for 10 days all day long. Competition starts at 8 am and generally runs until 6 PM.  As long as your there during these hours, you can watch any of the competitions you like.  You walk from arena to arena and watch the riders do their thing, and they announce the winners right then and there.  They also have warm up rings so you can watch the trainers and riders warm up for those competitions that are coming up, and its an awesome sight to see.

They also have an enormous amount of shopping here.  Everything from Jewelry, to clothes, paintings, furniture, horse and animal products such as saddles, harnesses, natural dog products and beds and a bunch more.  Lots of barn companies show up here as well for people who want to have one on their property! This is awesome to walk through and see!  They have really cute affordable ones that are 4 stalls big, that can house up to 4 horses, or you can make one a tack room and put 3 other horses in there at your preference.  They even have super expensive ones (the ones that I love and want) that are made of really fancy wood and have all kinds of awesome features in them. Some of these barns are as expensive as a house! Definitely a must see!  Some of the features are so cool I can't believe it!  

They have lots and lots of food here to eat as well with a lot of vendors to choose from.  Things like ice cream, lemonade and coffee from some of the small vendors who drive in to sell at the event, along with larger more well known local and national resturants who set up booths here to serve food of all kinds at the show.  I usually eat before the show, but you can find just about anything to eat here that a person can think of.  BBQ stands, chicken, veggie stuff, you name it, they sell it.

Another thing they do here is barn tours twice a day, where you can meet and play with the horses that compete. They also auction some of the horses on site, so you can watch some of them get bid on in front of the barns, and it's an awesome experience to watch.  Stud fees of $2000, and I've seen a few middle eastern men from Dubai spend 6 figures on these baby horses with fantastic blood lines to add to their horse collection.  Oh, and don't think the auction is for the weak of heart.  Plan on watching people spend several thousand dollars on these horses.  I saw a horse that was up for sale at a barn for $25,000. um, yea. I've heard of people spending 6 figures before because of bloodlines and rarity. 

If you haven't been, please go check it out. The show runs for 10 days every February and its totally a great way to spend an afternoon or two in the sun out here.  You don't have to ride horses (like I do) to appreciate what goes on."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"Last night, my friend was telling me about this new BBQ place and that he had wanted to try it.  I had never heard of it before, and thought it sounded like a good idea.  After checking out their website, I thought, why the heck not?

So, I shuffle down to this side of town, looking forward to a new BBQ place.  I had read several of the reviews before i left and went in with an open mind not really knowing what to expect.

Well, lets say its not what I had hoped it would be.  At first glance, the menu seemed decent enough, but as I spent time going through it, I realized they didn't have a lot of what I had expected for a BBQ place.  I guess this place is a popular stop at the AZ fair, at least according to their website and pamphlet at the restaurant.  When you walk in, the place is colorfully decorated, with plenty of seating, and lots of fair themed stuff.  Their really hip on promoting themselves as an AZ state fair vendor, and that's okay.  The decor reflects this.  Pretty cool, and probably the only thing that really left a halfway decent impression on me. (colorful decorations, lots of fair ride chairs throughout the place, decorated napkin holders with AZ state fair pictures on them, etc.)

After I went through their menu, I realized it was half American food and half BBQ.  Well, half burgers and have BBQ really.  I had questions about their BBQ, and was kinda dissapointed with the selection.  NO shredded beef or chicken, and no Brisket.  Just BBQ'd beef cut into slices and chicken parts.  Um, why can't I get shredded beef or chicken? Isn't that sorta standard fair for places like this?

So, we ordered our food at the counter and for 2 adults, it cost $34.06! HOLY CRAP THAT WAS EXPENSIVE.  I got the BBQ beef sandwich with a baked potato side, with a drink.  My friend went with the cheese fries, a sandwich and a drink.  It just seemed outrageously priced, and we were both shocked at the price point. If I wanted to spend $35 on dinner, I can think of a million different places to go besides here, and get a nicer meal with a waiter and a cool, fun atmosphere! 

So, we go sit down for our food, and we wait.  and wait.  and we wait some more.  Finally, after an extended period of time, my drink ran out and we were starting to think they forgot about our order.  My drink was running low, so I figured I would go refill it and check on the status of our order.  Mind you, there was a soda fountain to the hard right of the entrance.  I went there and realized they only had half the selection of drinks that the order counter did.  so, I schelp to the register, get my drink refilll and ask about my order.  They said it was the next ticket up and it would be a few more minutes. ok, so I sat back down.

I got back to my table and they brought out our food.  It was okay, but not $35 dollars awesome.  The beef was okay, and the potato was awesome, but the place is laid out really weird.  I couldn't find any silver ware, but my friend found it and he grabbed us both forks and such.  They also had a burger bar area, with napkins, straws, salad dressings, lettuce and all the burger toppings you would need.  (I think this is where he found the forks, but both of us missed the forks and had to ask where they were.  They were in a dispenser off to the side that neither one of us saw the first time we went to the counter.

Overall, I wasn't impressed.  Primarily over the really high price point here, and the fact that the food was just okay.I mean, the food wasn't bad at all, but after having some sticker shock at the bill, it kind of overshadowed the goodness of what we ate.  I've eaten at other burger and BBQ places, spent half the amount, and had WAY better food across the board.  

Overall, neither one of us plan on going back. I will say the service was awesome, and I wish more service was like this, but overall, the whole experience left us disappointed and I don't think we will be back any time soon."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"Back in July, a few of us girls at work found a living social coupon for this place for $20 for $20 classes.  Being that we all could use a little more exercise in our lives, I bought the coupon and started going to classes.

The Yoga studio is tucked away in a shopping center off Central and Camelback behind AJ's fine foods, and next to a hair salon.  

The basis of ""hot"" yoga is to do 26 yoga positions in a room held at 105 degrees with 40% humidity for 90 minutes.  This allows you to flush all the toxins from your body, speeds up your metabolism, reduces stress levels and basically cleanses your whole body while you get a good healthy workout. Intense? Yes, but not impossible.  You will sweat everything out, literally. I admit, like others here, you feel like quitting 15 minutes in because you think your going to die from the heat and your sweaty as hell, but KEEP GOING. IT GETS EASIER/BETTER. I cannot begin to tell you how awesome I felt after my first class. Just amazing!

For starters, even if your a beginner, like me, do not be intimidated! The class is welcoming to students of ALL levels. I've only been to one other yoga class before in my life, and that was 4 years ago.  Here are a few pointers to help you out and tell you more about the studio itself.

A) drink an enourmous amount of water before, during and after class! Especially  the day before class. The day before drink, drink drink! You will sweat like no other during class, and you need to stay hydrated.  Drink a lot of water after class, as your body is going to be dehydrated and you will be flushing toxins out of your body.  Also, when you bring water to class, make sure its frozen before hand.  If you don't, it'll be warm in 5 minutes and useless.  The studio does sell water bottles, but its like $3 a bottle.  You can go to Circle K and get one for a dollar, throw it in your freezer, and take it to class with you.

B) bring a big towel to put over your mat.  Your going to need it to collect the sweat, and to wipe your face and body periodically during class.  It also allows you not to slip on your mat when you do the standing poses for the first half of class.  The studio does rent towels, but it costs a few bucks. I bring a beach towel with me and it gets soaked by the end of class from sweating!

The studio itself is spacious, but fills up quickly.  You want to make sure you get a spot where you can see yourself in the mirror while you work out.  It allows you to perfect your poses as the instructor talks you through the class, helps you become more limber and stay focused.  I personally like to sit off to the right side because during class while the instructor is walking through the studio, they will open the doors and you can get a blast of cool air.  This my friends, is the most refreshing thing ever.  Sit off to the side near the door! You will thank me later!

The instructors themselves are really positive and encouraging.  My first class ever was with this girl Melissa, and she made me feel right at home, explaining everything! Each pose has a benefit for your body, and she (along with the other instructors) will tell you what its for. For example, there's one where you lay on your back and pull your legs to your chest- that's great for digestion, another for reducing anxiety, others for expanding your lungs and so on.  They also tell you to work at your own pace. Don't kill yourself! There's skill levels of all kinds here, and you'll notice it in class. 

I would go to classes with my friend Nicolle from work, and we had a blast. Each instructor brings their own personality to class, but you follow the same routine every single time. Some will work you harder then others, but again, go at your own pace.  If you feel like you need a break, lay down on your mat, or do the downward dog position like I do and pick up at the next position after you regain your composure.

The only downside to the studio is the studio itself smells funky! I wish they would spray some febreeze in here or something, because I think it smells! Aside from that, I really enjoyed my time here, and would love to go back in a heartbeat. Staff was awesome, positive and encouraging.  Plenty of class times available, and a great way to get back in shape."
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"I lived in this complex for 3 years and 9 months. I moved in here in July of 2008 and moved out in April of 2012. That's a long time!  A lot happened while I lived here, both good and bad, and I will try my best to cover everything in my review, good and bad.

For starters, when I moved in almost 4 years ago, I needed something affordable, close to the light rail (even though it wasn't open quite yet) and an express bus line so I could get downtown to work without having to pay for parking.  I found this place and decided to move in.

This place is a large property with two entrance's-one off Dobson (which is where my apt was located) and one off Broadway, where the main leasing office was located. It was run by a private local firm that was family owned, and the son ran the property.  They did a decent job of keeping up the property, and getting work orders done.  They upgraded the laundry rooms in the summer of 2009 to a card based system instead of using coins, rebuilt the retaining walls and kept the pools up as well.

Then, things started to change.  One day, in November of 2010, they suddenly sold to a new management company out of San Diego.  Mind you, I knew that this place wasn't super classy, but it wasn't a bad property either.  After the new mgmt company stepped in, things went downhill over the next year or so.  

In February of 2011 someone vandalized our mailboxes, and it took 6 months to replace them.  6 MONTHS!  Every Saturday I would have to go to the post office and grab my mail, and that was a huge pain the rear.  Every time I would call the office and ask when it was going to get fixed, I got some BS answer about parts being ordered, them having to deal with their insurance company, etc. It was a nightmare.  The mail boxes didn't get fixed until August of 2011.  This was the beginning of the end for me, and I started to look else where.

Also, this place has an extremely outdated interior. I don't think they've EVER updated it since this place was built 30 years ago.  The patios are made of wood and literally rotting right off the side of the buildings.  Interior paint is a yellowish 1970's shiny paint that's awful to look at.  Dark brown kitchen cupboards, small tiny kitchens that are hard to cook in with limited storage.  Bathrooms are okay in size, but have the oldest, ugliest vanities from literally 1972.  No air conditioning in the bedrooms and the walls are paper thin so when it gets hot, the AC has to really run.

I know what your thinking, why did I stay so long? Well, it was fine the first 2+ years I lived there, things were fine.  I would have moved out in 2010, but i had just started a new job and wasn't in a position to move so I resigned my lease.  I assumed I would have stayed here for only 2 years but I stayed for almost 4 due to circumstances out of my control (job change, and a few other things forced my hand to stay an additional year.)

I already knew I was moving, but finally, in February of 2012 the mgmt company that bought this place the year before walked away from the property.  How did we find this out?  Everyone in the property got a water shut off notice and the laundry rooms were locked for 2 weeks.  People started moving out like crazy.  I already had found a new place, so I had a place to go.

Also, by living here they only offer direct TV because that's all their wired for (no cox service here.) SRP is the electric company, which isn't so half bad. Open parking, and everyone gets a covered spot.  Also, because they offer direct TV, the satellite's are located on top of the buildings.  At least once to twice a year the maintenance men will go up to the roof to clear the drains and throw all the satellites offline. It takes like 3-5 days to get a service man out here, and the office never bothers to apologize for the guys throwing the TVs offline and no one cares. I spent Thanksgiving of 2011 with no TV and was miserable due to this.

Also, they fixed the gates at both entrances.  Downside to this?  You can't enter off Dobson-only exit! ARGH. Have to drive through the whole complex to get back in! 

The good thing, is that if you need an affordable place to live that's close to the light rail, the US 60, Loop 101 and the 202, this is your place.  Otherwise, run for your life!"
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"So, I was in the market for a new car since the lease on my Nissan was up and I couldn't seem to get out of that car fast enough.  I'd been searching for a few different cars and hadn't made up my mind quite yet as to what I was getting.  I've dealt with Bill Luke before, as they fixed my Grand Cherokee back in 2005 right after I moved to Arizona after I was in a hit and run on the I-17.  The body shop was awesome, and I thought I would give the sales department a try, so off I went.

Now, mind you, I had been shopping around. I had checked with a few other dealerships, so I was in the market for a Dodge or Jeep.  The other dealership that I had found on the west side of town only sold Dodges, and since I was torn between the Jeep Liberty and the Dodge Journey, I figured I'd give Bill Luke a try. I was in and out of the dealership probably 3 times by the time I had settled on what I had wanted.

Mack was the salesman that helped me throughout the process.  I started shopping in July, and he met me on the lot on a hot July afternoon.  I was standing there, staring at a Liberty and up he rolled in his golf cart on a very hot Saturday afternoon.  He showed me what he had on the lot, we talked some numbers and I left. 

I will say, on my first visit, I noticed that even though they have a large selection of vehicles, within that they seem to carry some of the more expensive cars, and not all styles and models.  For example, when we drove through the Dodge Ram section, they had something like 95 different Rams on the lot to choose from. So, whats the problem?  ALL but 2 of them were V8 Hemi's with quad cabs. EXPENSIVE. I asked where the V6 Rams were with extended cabs, and we only found one, and it was a stripped down work truck.  They didn't have any mid grade trucks.  FAIL!  Gas is expensive, and they NEED to have smaller engine Rams on the lot. I would drive a Ram, but NOT a V8 Hemi...horrible gas mileage and it would kill me.  This is just an example.  To me, I think you should have more V6's with different cab sizes, and they did not.

Second visit went better.  We toured the used section along with the Liberty's. More high end Liberty's like the Jet edition, and other ones with leather. I wanted a lower end model and even though they had a few, nothing was in my price range.

Finally I went back last Saturday the 15th and stuff got serious real quick.  I wanted a Journey, but found one that I liked at Larry Miller in Peoria. I printed out the internet information from Larry Millers website and said that if he could match the car and the price I would buy. I wanted a Journey in red, and off we went looking.  Sadly, the red ones were all 2013 models and I really wanted the 2012 since they had more incentives available.  Mack also told me that they would help me get out of my Nissan since I still had 3 payments left.

Anyways, after a bunch of haggling, test driving 2 different cars and walking the lot like 10 times, I decided to get a 2012 blue Dodge Journey for $300 a month for 5 years.  The down side is that when I got to finance, they told me that they couldn't take my Nissan back for me and I had to handle it myself! OMG I ALMOST LOST IT.  I was so upset! They said that if they took the Nissan back it would raise my payments. I should have walked out, but whats waiting another month going to do? nothing.  So, I went with the deal, and signed the paperwork. I blame the floor manager for not honoring the deal because they could have done it, but would not.  Mack was awesome, but I had to return the Nissan myself and that was as stressful as getting the new car!

My finance guy was awesome, but he tried to hard sell me on the extended warranty, which I passed on.  I get the 5 year/100,000 power train warranty, and the standard 3 year 36,000 mile coverage. I would recommend Bill Luke to anyone, as I am satisfied overall with the deal and service I received. It was a lot easier then when I leased my Nissan (which was a scary experience during the automotive bailout and 9 months after the banks failing in October of 2008. Yea, try getting a car deal during THAT nightmare!)

I also called and complained about how they wouldn't take my Nissan back and the sales manager said he would correct it, which he did.  (I'm leaving out those details, but they helped me out...didn't necessarily involve $$, but they listened to my complaint and took care of me.)

Overall, a positive experience.   I would recommend them to people, and don't be afraid to shop around. They will do their best to meet your needs sales wise, and won't treat you like a bag of crap like other dealerships have.  Will update as time goes on, but I love my new car!!!!"
qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ,"It's no surprise that I saved review 666 for Monetelano Apartments.  It started off so nice here, but by the time I moved out, I was so upset with them, I don't know that I can give them the 5 star review I had wanted to when I first moved in and lived here.

I found this place on the internet and fell in love immediately.  Well run community, all the amenities I could have asked for at an amazing price.  They have a wide variety of layouts, and their prices are fair.  They have 4 different layouts for the one bedroom apartments, and I went with A2 out of the 4.  678 square feet, private patio with a storage cabinet, huge walk in closet, wood floors in the kitchen, totally remodeled with a microwave, built in bookcases on the first and second floor and a fireplace if you lived on the third.  I fell in love and decided to move in after visiting the property.

Mind you, I came in two months before my lease was ending in 2012.  My lease was up at the end of March, and I came in at the beginning of January, so I had more then enough time.  I put down a deposit of $100 to hold a second floor apartment because I didn't want to live on the third floor, or the first.  By the time it came for me to move in in March, they didn't have a second floor apartment, and I got switched 3 different times.  Finally, they found a first floor apartment, but only after I had to stay an extra month at my old place, pushing my move to the end of April.  I feel like I wasted the $100 deposit for my second floor apartment since they not only kept reassigning me, but I ended up on the ground floor, neither of which I wanted.

So, I move in. I fell in love with my apartment, and everything was going fine.  After living here for about 3 months, the problems started.  My toilet flooded the apartment 3 TIMES.  Yes, I had 3 serious floods in my apartment.  The carpeting was ruined, they had to get carpet cleaners out to suck out the water that went into my kitchen, living room and bedroom.  It would happen randomly, and it was always when I wasn't at home.  I was PISSED.  I had to throw out my new rugs in the bathroom and kitchen because they were ruined!  They told me they would not reduce my rent or offer to replace the rugs since I had renters insurance, and basically told me that they had done their part to clean up the mess and I was on my own.  

Secondly, when it came time to move out, I felt like I got screwed.  They tried to charge me for the damage to the carpeting from the floods, and after some going back and forth I finally got the charges waved.  I knew I would owe something, but not $1000.  The move out was totally where I lost any respect I had for them.  I take responsibility and acknowledge that I would owe something (like two to three hundred dollars) but not $1000!   They said they had pictures, but they lied and did not.  Then they said that there were red stains on the carpeting, which there wasn't since I had pictures.  After emailing the assistant manager Mindy, and looking at the carpeting receipt, they were charging me for repairing the carpeting from the first flood where they cut it up.  Mysteriously, the charges were ""only $341 without the carpeting repair.

I found out later that the cause of the floods was because I lived on the first floor and tree roots were growing around the outside sewage line, and every couple months the lines would choke the sewage lines,  causing flooding in my first floor apartment. It also happened to the guy who lived next door to me as well, so it wasn't just my apartment.

Here are the benefits of living at Montelano:
-close to the light rail, which their extending up 19th Ave
-your in central Phoenix, so you can commute to just about anywhere in the city in less then 30 minutes.
-affordable with lots of amenities, plenty of layouts to choose from, and its mostly a well maintained community
-two well maintained pools, tennis courts, basketball courts, workout room, business center
-assigned parking with the option to tow if someone takes your spot.  The office will give you a tow card and you call the company to get the car out of your spot
-reasonable pricing
-full sized washer and dryers in the apartments

Downsides:
-the water bill here ran on average of $50 a month! I was in a one bedroom and was like WTF!  I know some of the two bedrooms water bills were well over $60 year round!
-office staff is friendly until you move out, so beware! 
-The assistant office manager is NOT a nice lady, and will try to screw you any way possible.  Please, go over her head to the property manager as she is an irrational cunt.
-when you try to reason them, they will use the ""we're trying to cut you a deal and if you go to corporate, their going to REALLY screw you"" routine.  FAIL
-several residents have had a hard time with management here, not just me.  Others have had similar experiences."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"I needed to get the windows tinted on my new car and after looking into a handful of tint shops, I made an appointment here. I picked LMS because we've taken some of our fleet cars at work here in the past, and their work always looked good and lasted years so far, still looking the same.

I told them that I wanted to drop my car off in the morning and then head back to work, so they asked me to swing by right when they open at 9 am. I arrived the next day 5 minutes early and there were already about 4 people in front of me waiting for the shop to open. I filled out some paperwork, and selected my film and darkness levels. I went with the Carbon film, which is their top of the line and comes with a lifetime warranty, all around and a windshield glare strip. I gave them the key and told them to call me on my cell when it was done. I left the shop at about 9:20 am.

Since there were 4 other cars ahead of me and only 3-4 employees there including the guys that work in the front, I expected it to be a while before they even got to my car. However, at noon I received a phone call from LMS saying that my tint was all done and I could pick up my car. Wow, already? The tint looks awesome and exactly how I pictured it looking on my car. The workmanship looks great and I didn't even see any bubbles even though they're perfectly normal until the film sets completely, so don't touch or roll down your windows the first week! 

This shop definitely does high quality work at low prices. Don't be fooled by how the shop looks on the outside! The film I got will typically run you about $189 for a 4 door sedan which is comparable to or lower than other places I was looking at, but they'll give you a lifetime warranty no questions asked. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get their vehicle tinted."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"I read all the great reviews about this place and had to check it out! My girlfriend has been talking about attending a painting class for a while, so I decided to finally take her to this one. I was glad I did because this place is a lot of fun, yet simple, even for people like me that suck at art and could mess up on a stick figure drawing!

They feature a different painting each class and it is on display near the front door so you can see an example of what you will be painting that night. You can also check their website for a calendar of scheduled paintings in case there's something specific you wanted to learn how to paint. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by the instructors, who will explain everything to you about the class. After you check in and pay for your class, you are free to grab drinks at the bar and food at the kitchen before you are seated (flatbread pizzas and cheese/fruit plates mostly). The instructors will then seat you and have you grab paintbrushes, an apron, and a plate of various colors of paint.

Once the class begins, the lead instructor will take you through the painting step by step, telling you which colors to use or mix and what shapes to draw on your canvass. They make the class very simple so that everyone can follow along and finish with a beautiful painting. The class is very social and there are even icebreakers and jokes worked into the class (so that the paint has time to dry in between). I'm a horrible artist and even my painting was pretty good at the end. We even took photos with the instructor and our paintings.

The room is decorated beautifully and there is also a wall of artwork displaying past canvasses painted in class. They also had a photo booth in the back corner but we didn't check that out. We had a blast in class and will definitely plan to come back soon!"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"I ran the 2016 Rock N Roll 10K and had so much fun! It was awesome being able to run down a totally shut down Las Vegas Blvd even though it wasn't technically at night. The race started at 4 PM which means when I got done it was barely getting dark. If you want to run in the dark, you'll have to go with the half or full marathon option.

This is my first ever Rock N Roll event so I'm not sure how they're usually set up. But despite the rock n roll theme, they didn't have as much music as I expected. If you like running with music, be sure to bring headphones because the sound stages are pretty few and far between. It seemed like I'd run a half mile, maybe even a full mile before seeing the next stage. Was not a problem for me because I always run with my headphones on. If you run the half or full marathon, there's a special pre-race concert so be sure to arrive early to catch that!

I'd recommend getting to the strip super early to park because the roads generally close by 2 PM. I parked at a south strip casino and then took the monorail to SLS which was the 10K start line. There's massive traffic after the race, so be sure to park on the west-side of the strip if you're heading west and vice versa.

Overall the race is pretty well organized. There are frequent water/Gatorade stations, even though I ignored all of them for the sake of recording a PR. Since it's Las Vegas Blvd, there are also random bystanders along the entire course to cheer you on! There are also a couple stations during the race where they hand out energy gels which was cool. After the race, be sure to collect all your goodies to help refuel! The chocolate milk was so tasty after my run!

I had a blast and can't wait to participate in this race again next year! I will probably do the 5K as well next time because the photos made it look like so much fun!"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"SkinnyFats offers exactly what their name suggests, food options that are either healthy or happy (comfort food). When I 1st pulled into the parking lot I noticed that their location is a little odd and hard to find since it's located inside a business complex with no signage except for the sign above their front door. It was a Sunday just after noon and it was packed inside with no available tables and we had a group of 7 Yelpers. We looked over the menu and placed all of our orders when a couple tables freed up so we snagged them up.

Be aware that the food here comes in large portions! The wedge salad that Nelson Q got looked like it was made with an entire stalk of Romaine lettuce, it was huge! And the chicken sandwich that Amelinda L was eating had a piece of chicken that was larger than the buns/everything else on the sandwich! I got the chicken and waffles which is on their secret menu that you have to ask for... I'm not sure if there's an acutal menu or if you just have to know what's on it. I only knew about the chicken and waffles because I saw a bunch of people eating it. The chicken was nice, tender and their breading was light and not too crunchy/hard. I liked that there was more chicken than waffle, unlike other places that skimp on the chicken part so I was pretty happy. I didn't try any of their shakes or juices, but the strawberry lemonade was awesome! Light, refreshing and not too sweet. I also loved the reusable cups complete w/ happy meter!

I would definitely come back to try some of their other dishes, especially the healthy ones. If you come here during one of the meal rushes be prepared to order take out or wait for a table since they don't have very many and it's not a big place to begin with. Maybe they will expand someday to relieve some of the traffic here, and hopefully that new location is closer to me!"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"After teasing Andrew C about his experience with sausages here yesterday, Roger T and I had to check this place out to see the quality of the meat they were packing. I've been to and go to Chicago frequently, and wanted to compare Vegas Al's sandwiches to the likes of Portillo's, Johnnie's, and other spots I've had up in the Chi. After all, I went to school up in Illinois. Just like in Chicago everything is a la carte and there are no combo meals to be had here. I went with an Italian sausage, dipped w/ giardinera (50 cents extra), large cheese fries and a soda. 

The food came out pretty quickly and the sandwich and box of fries were a lot bigger than I had imagined (based on reading the reviews). My sandwich was nice and juicy with lots of giardinera, just how I like it. Maybe people in Vegas just have never had a dipped sandwich before because mine was perfectly soaked but not yet falling apart even when I was eating it. The giardinera had good flavor and a good kick. Just sucks that you have to pay extra...pretty sure they don't do that in Chicago! The cheese fries came in a box and it was way more than I could finish. I recommend going with small fries unless you're sharing them.

Other than the extra charges for toppings, the pricing here was fairly reasonable, maybe a buck or so more than what they charge up in Chicago for beef and combo sandwiches...everything else seemed to be priced pretty similarly. I'll have to come back to try their beef and combo sandwiches and see if they are as stingy on the meat as the reviews are alleging. From what I saw on Roger's sandwich it seemed pretty reasonable but I could see them jipping you on the combo.

While writing this review I realized Al's Beef is actually from Chicago although I've never been to one up there. I'll be up in the Chi again in July so maybe I'll look for one and compare it to Vegas."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"Came here for the first time on Saturday and had such a bad experience I don't think we'll be back. If you decide to order the Broaster chicken, be warned that it could take up to an hour to prepare if they're busy!

My main complaint with this place isn't as much with the hour wait, but more with the way it was handled. I mean, yes there are signs saying the chicken is cooked fresh to order and would take 15 minutes usually. And then when we ordered our 4 piece chicken meals, we were told that the kitchen was busy and that it could be a 20-25 min wait, which I was ok with because I was really excited about trying Broaster chicken. 

However, the 25 minute estimate came and went, and we were still waiting and wondering if it was coming out soon. No updates, and no acknowledgement from the staff. After over 40 minutes I went and asked if the lady could check to see if the order was still being prepared or if it had perhaps been given to someone else. Without even checking my receipt or asking for my name and/or order, I received a snappy response that there was no way it has been 40+ minutes already. How rude and dismissive!

A few minutes after that encounter, the same lady, who my wife assumes is the owner, came back and told us that our food would be out shortly. Then after nearly 54 or 55 minutes of waiting our food finally was brought to us. Once we were eating, the lady came back several times to check on us and apologize which got no response from me. Too little too late. Where was all the attention and updates earlier when we were left wondering if we had been forgotten about?!

We had originally planned on staying for dessert but after that experience we decided to leave and not spend any additional time or money at this place. Don't recommend this place but if you do come I'd recommend not ordering chicken or hot food unless you're not pressed for time whatsoever"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"Came by here after reading all the reviews on Yelp to see if they could diagnose my check engine light that's been on for a while. When I arrived they informed me that they would have to charge me if I didn't already do my own scan and know the error codes so I drove down the street to Auto Zone really quick to get it re-tested since I hadn't written them down.

I got back to the shop about 15 min later with the 2 error codes and went inside the office to speak with one of the mechanics. They looked at my codes and told me that they were fairly generic and they would have to do their own diagnosis to determine the exact problem and that it would be a $43 charge. I asked him what he thought the problem could be how much I would be looking at to fix it and he stated his opinion and gave me an estimated price for the work that would need to be done if that was indeed the problem. Since I was looking at just under a grand in potential repairs, we then had a discussion about what would happen if I ignored the issue and continued to drive. Good to know that the only major issues would be failed smog checks and poor gas mileage and not engine damage. The seemed very honest in his discussion and felt like a normal conversation and not the sales pitch that other shops seem to give. He told me just to continue driving to see if the Check Engine Light goes away and if it didn't then to come back when I was ready to pay the $43 to have my car inspected/diagnosed further.

In the end, they spent a lot more time talking to me about my car and concerns compared to other places that seem to blow you off if you're not getting work done. Their pricing is also very reasonable from the estimate I was given, especially since the Mazda dealership wanted over $200 just to diagnose my Check Engine Light. If I continue to have car troubles I'll be sure to come back to get repairs done here and update my review."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"Decided to try Viet Bistro because I wanted to find a pho place closer to home instead of always having to drive down to Chinatown. This hole in the wall is definitely not worth another visit because the pho broth was mediocre and pretty bland, and the people working here don't speak much English and won't understand your order no matter how many times you say it while pointing at the item on the menu.

When we first walked into the restaurant, it seemed really dark and smokey. Rachel S and I were seated at a small table but I asked to be moved because they gave us the wobbliest table possible. To buy time to review the menu, I told the lady that we would start with an A8 (nem nuong cuon) while pointing direclty at ""A8"" on the menu. She seemed to have trouble understanding me so I repeated it multiple times while continuing to point at it. When our appetizer was brought out, it was like a bowl of noodles or something and I told them they had the wrong table because we didn't order that. She told me that I had said N8 right?...NO! WTF! How can you possibly get it wrong when I was pointing at A8 and repeating it about 100 times! The lady contested me and didn't believe me until she brought me the menu back and I showed her what A8 was.

At least our pho was made correctly but the broth was bland and tasteless. I added a bunch of hoisin sauce which helped a little, but that broth definitely needed a lot of help. The meat and noodles were fine. Just wished the bowl contained a little less steak and more tripe and tendon...because the bowl I ordered was supposed to have all 3 but all I saw was 1 piece of tripe and tendon and a ton of steak.

When our nem nuong cuon finally came out, it was ok. Definitely not the best although it still tasted good. They use cucumbers for crunch instead of egg roll shell crumbles like Nem Nuong Bistro/Brodard. Go there instead, especially because it's the same price at 2 for $4.95"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"Been looking for a decent stir fry/Mongolian BBQ place in Vegas since I miss Flat Top Grill when I used to live in Illinois, and decided to try out Stir Crazy. We walked in on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was pretty empty since it was around 3 PM. We were greeted and asked to sit wherever we liked. When placing our drink order, I thought it was a little odd that they didn't serve hot tea any other warm beverages, being an Asian fusion place an all...and they only have soda and iced tea ($2.49 w/ refills). We were handed 2 bowls and we headed off to the buffet area to make our food. For lunch you can choose between $9.99 for a single bowl or $13.99 for AYCE. Dinner is AYCE only.

Since we didn't really plan on getting the AYCE option, we tried cramming as much as we could into our bowls. You can choose from 4 types of meat: pork, beef, chicken or turkey; and then add various veggies, toppings, noodles and sauces. Among the toppings were even diced ham and sausage which tasted surprisingly good with thest rest of my food. They had a pretty large selection of veggies which was great, although there are only a handful of sauce choices. Since I wasn't sure which sauce to get, I went with the house option. They have posters of recommended sauce receipes on the wall that you can try if you'd like.

Once you're done cramming your bowl, you simply bring it up to the cook at the grill and he'll ask you if you want rice. If you opt for rice, you can choose between white or brown rice, and he'll include a scoop of it on your plate alongside your cooked food. Overall, the wait time wasn't too long for our food to be cooked. Maybe 5 min for our 2 bowls.

Although our waiter, Bobby, didn't have to do much but bring us refills and our check, he was really nice and checked up on us to see how our food was. The restaurant isn't really decorated and lacks an inviting feel to it, but the food and staff were great so that didn't really matter in the end."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"Came here to try their monthly buffet and have decided this place is mediocre at best...This place is way over-rated! How they have an average of nearly 5 stars is beyond me because I would not come back, especially at the prices they're charging! $22.99 for a dinner buffet is ridiculous when you walk in and see this hole in the wall joint and their tiny spread of about 7 or 8 items on the ""buffet"", with most of those items being sides such as sauerkraut, red cabbage, mashed potates, spaetzle, etc. Don't get me wrong, I liked the sides, but just wish there were more entree type items instead of just the 4: assorted sausages, schnitzel, roasted chicken, and some hamburger patty looking thing .

The dessert spread is also a joke, with most of it being stale and looking worse than Hostess packaged snacks...why wasn't there any Black Forest cake or strudel? And why does a German buffet serve stale cupcakes and cookies? The buffet includes a soft drink but if you want beer that will cost extra. If you want a pretzel or real dessert, such as strudel, you'll have to pay extra too. So where does the $22.99 I'm paying for the ""buffet"" go? 

The staff was nice and kept coming by to check on us and refill our drinks. There was a little confused when we arrived because they couldn't figure out my reservation and we eventually figured out that they had for some reason crossed me off the list even though a reserved tag with my name on it was cleared set on the table. Reservations are recommended here at any given time because their place is so tiny and it for some reason gets very packed.

I wouldn't say that I'm an expert when it comes to German food but I've definitely had some way better places, and at cheaper pricing too. There aren't many German joints in Vegas but I'd say one of my favorites anywhere is still Hoffbrauhaus, which is surprisingly cheaper than this place! Yeah it doesn't make sense to me either...I'd say skip this place and save your money!"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"I don't get all the bad reviews for this place. They're a used clothing store, and they sell their items for $15-25 on average, what would you expect? Clothing and jewelry have a pretty bad resale value and once you buy an item, whether you wore it or not, guess what? It's used! Also, don't bring your garbage clothes that you've worn for years. Customers only will buy preowned items if it's still in newer or good condition and that's all the store is going to want to buy from you

I wish I had known about this place all these years! I've always just donated all my stuff to Goodwill, even my newer or real nice stuff! I like that I can basically trade in clothing that I'm tired of or can't wear anymore for something different that I actually will wear!

When you walk in, there's a sell counter to the right of the door and a buy counter to the left. Just walk up to the sell counter and hand them your goods. The associate will then look through everything 1 piece at a time and select items they think will sell in their store. Then you can choose from either cash or store credit. Everything is based on what they will price the item at in the store. If you choose cash you'll receive 30% of the price, but you'll get 50% (nearly double) if you choose store credit.

What will they buy? Basically anything in current season (i.e.: shorts for summer or coats/pants in winter) that's of a popular brand (think Nike, J Crew, Polo, Lacoste, Levis, True Religion, Under Armour, Coach, Gap, Banana, etc). Of course, make sure it's in like new or lightly used condition!

Either way you choose, proceed to the buy counter afterwards to cash out. If you take cash, they'll pay you on the spot. If you choose store credit, you can either choose to receive a gift card or select items that you'd like to purchase. It's basically like a trade! I'd highly recommend the store credit option because your money will go a lot further, especially if there's an outfit you've been looking for!"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"I recently purchased a 2014 Dodge Charger from Ryan Miller at Towbin Dodge and it was hands down the smoothest car transaction I have seen. Prior to coming here I was dreading coming into the dealership because most other ones I've been to have left me leaving empty handed and unhappy due to their rudeness or pushy sales tactics. Everyone over at Towbin Dodge was very nice before, during, and after the transaction and never did I feel uncomfortable or unsure about my purchase. I felt like everyone, especially Ryan, was very reasonable during negotiations and unlike other dealerships I've been to, I didn't feel like something was being hidden from me prior to signing. 

I had heard about Towbin Dodge from searching online through all the Dodge dealerships in town and they seemed to have the most inventory, color selection and best online pricing in town...I guess that's what makes them the KING OF CARS! There was a little mishap when we first walked in though because the salesperson I had been in contact with via e-mail had to go home sick but we were quickly introduced to Ryan, who is new to Vegas and Towbin but is very knowledgeable about cars...probably because he's owned or driven seemingly everything on the market; just ask him to tell you about them! I was very impressed and we spent quite a while talking about various fast cars and not just Dodge vehicles.

Come to Ryan and he'll take care of you and go above and beyond to make sure that you're satisfied with your new car. After we spent 4 hrs going through test drives and paperwork, it was closing time so they were unable to detail my new car on the spot. Ryan called me the next morning and scheduled an appointment for Monday morning. When I dropped my car off I was given a loaner car for the day which was awesome because I didn't have to worry about getting to work or back to the dealership. I picked up my car today and it looks even prettier than when I bought it! That Redline Pearl really shines :)"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"Time for an update and an upgrade. Since discovering this place a few months ago I've found myself coming here quite often and pretty much anytime I'm craving a boba drink or fruit smoothie. Their drinks are the best in town and for the price ($3.50-4.00 avg for medium) you really can't beat it in quality, especially because they use fresh fruit in their smoothies. I've never had a bad drink here and their consistency is what keeps me coming back. My favorite drinks here are their mango smoothie and taro milk tea. Don't forget to grab a stamp card to take advantage of their Buy 10 Get 1 Free offer, although you can only choose from the medium tea drinks when you redeem a free one. Medium is the recommended size because the large is pretty big unless you're drinking on an empty stomach or sharing.

I haven't actually eaten an actual meal here in a while but regularly get orders of their popcorn chicken, which is probably the best I've had in town for the $5.50 price point. It's always made fresh so it might take about 10 minutes to get it. I've also had their dumplings and green onion pancake and they were really good. I like the thick skin on the dumplings so they don't break as easily. 1 order of dumplings is 14 pieces, but they now also have a smaller order of 8 which is good so you can try other things on the menu as well. The green onion pancake is freshly fried, greasy and crispy and for only $2.50, it's a yummy good deal. They also sell pho now which is a little weird because the owners and staff are Chinese and the rest of their menu is Chinese/Taiwanese.

The only thing I wish they could do better is their service since they usually only have 1 server, who also doubles as the cashier and is usually 1 of 2 teenage looking guys who sometimes seem like they have no idea what they're doing. As long as the older lady makes your drink, you'll have one of consistent quality. There was only 1 time where 1 of the kids made my drink and I felt like it wasn't as good and I got less boba than usual."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"The Gun Garage is a small gun shop and range quietly tucked away on Dean Martin Dr, just south of Tropicana Ave. Their range is located in the back of the store, where you can rent firearms, as well as bring your own if you're a local. Although their range is small, with only about 10 lanes, they do have 3 lanes set aside marked ""locals only"". This is nice because you don't have to wait for a lane, since their main clientelle are tourists renting full auto rifles. You'll see them. They're the ones taking pictures on the range or jumping/screaming when they hear the loud boom of a .50 cal rifle.

The staff is helpful and nice for the most part. The girls at the gun counter are young, attractive and surprisingly knowlegeable about firearms. Go ahead a fire away with the questions (no pun intended). Their answers will be on point. You can bring your own targets and hearing/eye protection or purchase/rent theirs at about a buck each. 

Only bring large paper targets though since you'll only have the ability to clip the targets on cardboard at each lane. We had smaller targets as well and were unable to set them up, so we asked one of the girls at the gun counter if we could borrow some tape. The girl was nice and handed us a roll of duct tape as long as we brought it back. Later on while at the lanes, a safety officer saw our roll of duct tape and took it away. When we asked to borrow a few more pieces of tape, he said no and asked if we'd like a paper target instead since the tape was expensive. We thought this was odd but agreed. However, on our way out we overheard the same safety officer going off on the poor girl that had given us the tape...didn't think that was necessary...how much could a roll of duct tape possibly be? And if it's your personal roll then don't bring it to work to share if it's that big a deal! Very unprofessional but luckily this was the only issue we encountered. 

Also, be sure to check-in on Yelp to receive $5 off your range fee. Each shooter must show a check-in offer to receive the discount."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"This was my 1st visit to a drive-in so I really didn't know what to expect. I had driven by this place thousands of times before when heading home from work and never thought to check it out until now. I like that most movies are double features so you can see 2 movies for the price of 1, at a very affordable price of $7 per person. 

Because I didn't know what to expect I figured we would just sit in the car...bad idea in this summer heat! Even with the windows down, I felt drenched in sweat halfway through the movie. I would recommend bringing chairs so you can sit outside your vehicle unless you have a truck or are rich enough to run your engine and A/C for an entire 2 hour movie. The parking area in front of the screens are dirt but there are raised mounds for you to park which kind of prevents your view from being blocked...of course unless there's a huge truck parked in front of you...

When you pull onto the property there are separate lines at the ticketing booths depending on which movie you're seeing. Once you pay for your tickets, you'll receive a receipt indicating which screen it's playing on and what FM radio station you need to tune in to that movie. You're allowed to bring whatever food and drinks you want as long as it doesn't involve a grill or alcohol, but they still have a full service concession stand in case you're too lazy to pre-plan. The pricing at the concession stand seemed pretty reasonable since it was slightly lower than traditional ""indoor"" movie theaters but I still didn't get anything since we had plenty of food with us already. The restrooms are also located by the concession stand, as are a handful of arcade games in case you have kids or want to kill sometime before your next movie starts. 

We ended up leaving within the 1st 20 min of our 2nd film because it just was too hot to get comfortable. While I will still prefer a traditional theater over this one for my movies, it really is an interesting concept and it's tons more affordable so I'm sure I'll be back many more times in the future."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"I was nervous before showing up here because of all the horror stories I had read online about being ripped off or lowballed when selling a car to them but Amelinda L assured me that I would have a positive experience and provided me with her contact, Joe Memolo. 

Note: This review only reflects my experience in selling a vehicle to them as I have not purchased or serviced any vehicles here.

Joe was really nice and walked me through the process even when knowing that I was not going to buy a vehicle from him on the same day. Even though he was busy completing a sale, he met up with me to discuss my car and put it in to start the appraisal process before returning to the customer he had been meeting with. I waited for about 15-20 min before he returned and told me that my appraisal had been completed. Wow that was fast! We then went over the appraisal on his computer, which included the CarFax report, and despite a couple of issues found that I was unaware of, I couldn't believe the offer because it was higher than I had expected! He then printed the written offer from CarMax and informed me that I had 7 days to decide. I told him that I would accept it on the spot and had my title with me.

Joe then walked me over to the business office where I met with a buyer to complete the contract, titling and other paperwork. I also had a chance to clean out my car and they removed the license plates for me. This phase took about 30-40 min. I was pleased and pleasantly surprised at how smooth the process was. Never was there any lag time, stress, confusion or changes to the written offer they had given me. 

Once everything was completed I was given copies of all paperwork signed and my check for the sale and I was out the door! Joe stopped back by halfway through the paperwork process to check on me which was great to see. Nothing could have made the process any smoother and I was in and out the door in less than 90 min. I would recommend Joe Memolo to anyone looking to do business with CarMax and I will be back to see him next time I need to buy/sell a car at Carmax"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"Decided to finally stop by after one of my friends told me that they come here all the time. After we were seated and handed menus, I was surprised at how simple it was - a small rectangular laminted piece of paper printed from front to back. The front showed mostly rice and noodle dishes, which is what we decided to go with. Since there was only 2 of us, we ordered 3 items to share: fried chicken w/ rice, Hoi Nam chicken w/ seasoned rice,  and beef ramen. I was informed when ordering that the fried chicken would take 20 min to prepare, which I was ok with since we had 2 other dishes to eat.

The Hoi Nam chicken and seasoned rice was good, and the rice had an interesting taste to it which we liked. The chicken seemed well seasoned, juicy and perfectly cooked. The beef ramen, wasn't really Japanese style ramen, but then again this is a Chinese restaurant so why would it be? It was more like a beef noodle soup with ramen noodles and kind of reminded me of Taiwanese beef noodle soup, just not spicy at all and with ramen noodles instead of rice noodles. The beef was soft, tender and not over cooked and the soup was decent, but could've been seasoned a little better. When the fried chicken finally came out it was extremely hot and crispy and therefore delicious. I would return just for this dish alone since I'm a big fan of seasoned fried chicken.

Tried the almond pudding for dessert, which comes in a small container for $1.25 per order. The pudding was flavorful and refreshing, and included small lychee and longan in it.

Service was ok, mainly because there was only 1 waitress working on a Saturday night when most of the tables were full. You might experience a slight wait when trying to place your order or get refills, but it wasn't a big deal for me because we weren't in much of a hurry.

It was a nice surprise to see that tax is included in the menu pricing so what you see is what you pay. They do have a $10 minimum to use a card, but we decided just to pay cash. Our total was just over 17 bucks. What a deal! I'm sure I'll be back many times over in the future. Doesn't get any better than simplicity and low pricing at an Asian restaurant!"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"I'm going to start frequenting BJ's more, because I had forgotten how delicious their beers were! Since moving to Vegas I haven't gone to BJ's much because there are so many other options when dining out. If you're a beer lover, this place is a must try because they are as much of a microbrewery, as they are a restaurant. Sometimes if they're promoting a certain beer, your server may even offer you a sample. Or if you're not sure what to get, opt for a flight of ""samples"".

When it comes to food, BJ's is comparable to Yardhouse or other mid-range bar/grill type places. I typically go for a couple of their small plates, which are tapas sized appetizers, to start off and my favorite is the mini-bruschetta. On my most recent visit, I also tried the new corn fritters w/ bacon aioli and an order of their traditional wings, which are pieces of fried chicken with a side of buffalo sauce and a side of ranch. The food is always fresh...the only issue I've had is that sometimes they deliver food to the wrong table because your server is never the person who brings out the food...not sure why that is because that is typically why each table is assigned a server isn't it? 

The burgers, flatbreads, pizza, and appetizers here are all usually pretty tasty and sometimes I have no idea what I want to order. If you come Mon-Fri during lunch, there's a lunch specials menu you can order off of with pretty decent pricing...I think it starts at $6.95, but I've never tried it so I'm not sure what the portions are like.

The staff here at this location are nice and continuously stop by to check on you. If you're seated in an area where the server is busy, another server will often stop by and introduce themselves and put in your drink order so that you're not just sitting around like an idiot. I like that. They also have a rewards program but sadly you don't get points/credit for alcohol/beer! 

This BJ's is always packed when I'm here in the evenings and I can see why! The bar area is nice with both tables and barstools, and many large TVs, making it a good place to watch sports as well. I will be coming back a lot more in the future, even if it's only for beer!"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"This exhibit ended up being just ok and a lot smaller and quicker to visit than I had imagined. I'm a big fan of the show and when a co-worker had a couple tickets to give away, I jumped at the opportunity! Tickets are normally about 30 bucks, which is quite a bit since you'll to through the entire thing and solve your crime in about 30-40 min. There are 3 scenarios and they will assign 1 to your group once you pay and check in to receive your assignments. Each participant gets a pen, clipboard and worksheet where you will jot down your notes and evidence just like a real CSI. Then off you go to watch a short 3 min video introduction and then a visit to the crime scene you were assigned. We were the red team or crime scene #3, which involves skeletal remains that were found in the desert.

After visiting your respective crime scene, you go into the lab, where there are stations located throughout corresponding to your specific crime scenes. Find each station and watch videos, read signs and work on computers to reveal answers to the questions on the worksheet to lead you to solving your crime. At the end you will report  your findings to your supervisor via computer to receive your diploma, which you have to pay $5.95 for or you can email it to yourself, which is what we did...really, who is going to pay $5.95 for a piece of paper printed in color ink? Felt like they nickel and dimed you for everything...admission, then diploma, and then photo. 

This final stage where you submit your report/findings is also where you will throw on CSI vests, hats and fake guns to take a green screen photo. There are various backgrounds that you can choose from and they have you take 3 different poses. Photos were $14.95 each and then $6.95 for each additional one after the first. We decided to buy a photo because we really liked one of the backgrounds.

Overall we had a good time but including taking photos, picking the one we liked and making the purchase, we were there less than an hour. Definitely not worth the full price they are charging, but it's worth a visit if you can get some kind of discounted ticket or coupon or something, especially if you're a fan of the show/series."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"Been here a couple times and I've quickly learned that their BBQ meats are the only thing worth getting. Don't get me wrong, their BBQ is probably the best I've had in town, but the other items on their menu? Not so good and I would not get it again.

First thing you'll notice when you walk in are the BBQ meats hanging from the window by the back counter. Their roast pork belly with the crispy skin is to die for and their BBQ pork is really good as well. I haven't tried the chicken or duck so can't comment on it but from the looks of everything hanging in the window, it looks pretty damn delicious. You can order meats as an order or rice plate combo. If ordering to go, everything is by weight.

The other items are another story. I've tried the congee, BBQ pork chow fun, Chinese broccoli and a combo soup noodle w/ pig feet and curry beef tendon. The congee was meh, so-so; I've definitely had better at dim sum places. The BBQ pork chow fun was the only thing good out of this group and probably only because it had BBQ pork. The Chinese broccoli was all stems and very little leafy parts which was disappointing and the soup noodle was terrible because the noodles were clumped together which made it difficult to eat.

Because this is a traditional Chinese style restaurant, service is not very good and it'll take a while to get someone's attention even though they have many employees roaming the restaurant at any given time. Also, don't bother speaking to them in Mandarin because their English is definitely a lot better than their Mandarin...they'll just look at you like they understand and then they'll disappear and you'll never get what you asked for. We spoke to 3 different waiters in Mandarin trying to get our check and to go boxes and 1 by 1 they disappeared and were never seen again. After waiting 10 min and speaking with 3 waiters, we ended up going up to one of the ladies and speaking to her in English and magically we got what we wanted. If they didn't understand us then why wouldn't they just say so? How rude! Definitely 1 star for service based on my most recent visit! But their BBQ is good and I'll continue coming back just for that, but not anything else though"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"Hands down the best prime rib I've ever had! Came here for my birthday last weekend and it was my 1st time at a Lawry's. I had heard so much about their prime rib, so as a prime rib lover I couldn't wait to check it out! We made reservations in advance but I'm not sure if it is necessary because the restaurant didn't appear full, even on a Saturday night. 

Once you are seated you are presented with a dinner menu and wine list. Once we selected our bottle of wine - Lawry's private selection Chardonnay, our waiter explained the menu and ordering process to us since it was our 1st time at Lawry's. After this, for some strange reason our menus were taken away. If you would like to add a lobster tail to your meal or any sides besides creamed corn and creamed spinach, this is when you have to place those orders.

The prime rib is brought around on carts and sliced at your table. You are asked for the cut size you'd like, along with how cooked you like it. In my opinion, for prime rib you definitely have to go medium rare. I went with the Lawry Cut which is around 10 oz. All prime rib dinners include mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding, which is a puffed bread and not an actual pudding as I had thought lol. 

You have the option of adding a scoop of creamed corn or creamed spinach, which were good but definitely not worth the ridiculous 7 bucks per scoop price! Now we know. Other sides come on small plates and we opted for some mushrooms which were $9. The meat was perfectly seasoned and very juicy. Usually when you have prime rib, some areas are more seasoned or dry than others...that was certainly not the case here and even the parts without fat were juicy and flavorful.

At the end of the meal, our plates were taken away and a buser came by to de-crumb our table - fancy!. This is when we were handed dessert menus. Too full to order anything and about to depart for my UYE party, I was about to decline dessert when they brought out a small cupcake sized shortcake with a single candle on top. This was a nice surprise to close out our wonderful meal. 

I will definitely be back and can't wait until next time! Before leaving the restaurant, I was already thinking when my next visit would be!"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"I had been here a couple times in the past, but it had been a couple years, mainly due to the recent health issues they were having around 2013 but decided to give it another try so I came here last month with Rachel S, Stephanie K and Michael K. It was a Friday night and when we arrived, there was a 30-40 min wait! Wow, I've never seen it so packed! I guess people weren't concerned about their health violations anymore which was a good sign to me. 

Once we sat down we ordered a bunch of food including: marinated short ribs (kalbi), spicy pork, pork belly, marinated pork belly, marinated rib eye (bulgogi), beef tongue, and steamed egg. We were also brought a big house salad, rice, and banchan dishes while we waited for our meat. The banchan was ok and I really only liked the kimchi. The salad was surprisingly very tasty and I actually wanted more! The salad and banchan are refillable so don't be shy! It's all you can eat!

As usual, my favorite meat was the pork belly! It was basically just sliced pork belly but it was great with the salt/pepper/oil sauce mixture they give you. The kalbi and bulgogi were good too but the thing I kept wanting more of was the pork belly! I also couldn't get enough of the sauce even though it was so simple. Goes to show that sometimes the best things in life are the simple things! The steamed egg was also awesome and I could've eaten multple bowls! My least favorite was the marinated pork belly which looked mushy and was chewy and not like pork belly at all...

The grills were ok, just make sure yours is turnt up because ours wasn't and in the beginning we were trying to figure out why it was taking so long to warm up. The vents also do nothing here so you'll smell like grilled meats when you leave here so I'd suggest not getting all dressed up to come eat here. The staff was ok as well. Sometimes it was hard to get a server's attention because it was so busy so you have to flag them down as they walk by otherwise you won't really get checked on. Parking is also pretty horrendous on busy nights so you may have to drive around multiple times to find a spot at all.

At $16.99 AYCE Korean BBQ, this place is hard to beat in value for what you get and it will remain my go to KBBQ spot."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! I've been a member for about 3 and a half years now and Lifetime Summerlin is hands down the best gym in town! It's even better than the Henderson location or the 3-4 other locations I've been to around the country; mainly due to the set-up and cleanliness of this location! I love that they have a parking garage and a 3-floor building set-up which really spreads everything out.

I get asked all the time, and yes Lifetime is pricey (around $150/month for an individual or $234/month for a couple) but it's totally worth it! Believe me, I was unsure back in 2015 when we were considering joining. First off, this location is diamond level which is the highest of all their gyms, which means you can basically go to any location for free! Members of gold or onyx locations that visit a diamond location have to pay a per visit upcharge fee! 

Also would you rather pay a little each month for a gym you rarely go to? Or a bit more for one you'll actually enjoy coming to all the time? I've been a member of several gyms in Vegas, and I recall my visits to some of them were sporadic throughout the month/year. Once I switched over to Lifetime, I started going all the time. Why? It's less crowded, the machines/equipment are well maintained and always work, the people aren't rude and the place doesn't smell like a public restroom.

This location also features a rock climbing wall, a full service spa and café, outdoor and indoor pools and hot tubs, steam room, sauna. Need to change or shower at the gym? All towels are included, as are basic toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, razors, lotion, cotton swabs, etc) in the locker room. Just simply bring a change of clothes!

Group exercise classes are included in your membership and the instructors are wonderful! If you need slightly more help/guidance they also have personal training as well as TEAM training (which is basically like small group personal training) for an additional fee. 

All in all, I love this gym! If your fitness hours are flexible, I'd recommend coming outside of their peak hours which seem to be 6 AM to 9 AM and 4 PM to 7 PM on weekdays, and before noon on weekends. It does get busy during these hours, however, compared to some of the other big gyms in town its not bad at all. Aside from the parking garage being packed, it never seems crowded once I get inside the building...probably because everyone is spread out amongst all the classes, pools and equipment/floors"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"Now I remember why I never come to this location when I go to TGI Fridays...service is terrible! When we arrived we were told it was going to be a 30 min wait. Since it was Friday night, we figured that made sense and we sat around waiting for our table. About 20 min later we were told that our table was ready and followed the hostess into the restaurant where we were led to the far back left corner, passing through a half empty restaurant! If there were dozens of tables empty, why did we have to wait and more importantly, why were we lied to about a 30 min wait when they could've pieced together 2 tables to fit our party of 5 easily! 

When it came time to order our drinks and appetizers, I inquired about happy hour and was told it was only at the bar. Since my friend had his nephew with him we couldn't move to the bar, oh well. We placed our drink and food orders, with Rachel and I going with the $10 unlimited appetizers - mozzerella sticks and boneless wings. The mozz sticks and wings were decent since those are pretty difficult to screw up. My 2nd order of mozz sticks were not as good and the cheese wasn't as melted which is how I like it. Our 2nd order of wings had the garlic parmesean sauce on it, which tasted kind of funky. Rachel couldn't eat it because it looked like snot to her lol.

When it came time to pay, we split the check between 2 cards and when the waitress saw this she asked for our IDs. Hold up, hold my phone. Since when do restaurants check for IDs when paying for a meal?! At first I refused to show my ID on the principle that no merchant is supposed to ask for ID anyways when paying with a card (Visa and MasterCard both prohibit this), much less a restaurant. However, it didn't seem like she was going to let me use my card if I didn't show her my ID. A little argument ensued where I informed the waitress that by doing so her business is in violation of their contracts/agreements with MasterCard and that I would report them for such a violation if she continued to ask for my ID. In the end, I decided to just comply by tossing my ID at her rather than just walking out and not paying. I figured I'd contact MasterCard and their corporate customer service to voice my complaints, because an hourly paid waitress is too dumb to understand anything related to business or contracts anyways. All she kept saying was that she could send her manager over as if that was going to solve anything. She said it was store policy so I'm pretty sure her manager was the one that taught her this. Idiots."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"This review is based on having the lunch buffet which is available on weekdays for $10.99. Long story short, I wouldn't recommend this place for lunch or for the buffet because not only was the food meh but the service was horrendous.

When we got there, the host asked how many were in our party to be seated. We told them that our friends were already here and asked if they minded if we took a quick peek around the corner to see if they were seated already. The host said no problem and we walked past him. After looking for about 5-10 seconds, he walks back in front of us and says ""maybe they're not here yet"", as if to call us liars and try to seat us anyways. We walked back towards to entrance to call our friends to see where they were. The host follows us around the whole time as if we're not allowed to walk freely in the lobby. He continued to challenge us even after I told him nicely that our friends had texted us that they were seated somewhere inside before we even walked in. We eventually found our party, which had been seated towards the back. We ignored the host and just made our way towards them. 

After being seated it was impossible to get someone to stop at our table to ask questions about the buffet and menu. I thought about ordering off the menu,but my group wanted to go for the buffet, so I thought why not? Once we started eating, the only time we saw a server was when we needed refills on water and soda. No one ever stopped by to ask us how we were doing or took our plates. I even grabbed some plates and threw them on an empty bar where nobody was sitting because they were piling up. I also had to get up and grab my own sauces and napkins from the waiters' supply corner...no customer service whatsoever, but this is an Asian restaurant so who knows if they even care. There was also not very many people there for the noon lunch hour compared to what you would expect when experiencing a lapse in service. Maybe 2/3 of the restaurant was full if even. Had the restaurant been completely full, I would've taken that into account. There was also some confusion when we were paying our bill so it seems like the hostess' don't know what they're doing either.

The buffet featured items such as chow mein, pad thai, garlic wings, mint chicken and other typical buffet foods. The selection was small as there were only 2 tables worth of food. Most of the food was bland (pad thai especially) and some of the fried items were 90% dough and not much filler (egg rolls, fried banana are examples). The only thing that I really ate more than a couple bites of was the chow mein and garlic wings...show I really just filled up on wings. Not really what you would expect at a Thai restaurant.

While I was eating, I was already thinking about how I was going to word this review because I was unhappy the entire meal. Keeping in mind that it was only the buffet that we had, makes me want to go back and try ordering items from their menu. However, the service was a real turn off and I've had better service at fast food joints than what I had today at Lotus. I doubt we'd be back in the future. Not sure how this place got their Zagat rating because I'm pretty sure service counts for something."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"I just can't bring myself to give them any higher than 2 stars, which I believe is already generous enough based on their tactics of false information/advertising to lure certain customers in. Don't come here if you usually ask for adjustments at tea shops regarding the sweetness of your drink because everything here is pre-sweetened despite a posted sign at the register showing adjustments between 0% to 100% sweetness are possible.

It was such an ordeal to get a drink here, due to their false info, that it really pissed me off and has turned me off of coming back again. Had they simply not had the sign posted and would just tell me upfront that everything is pre-sweetened, I would've walked out without ordering anything - no harm, no foul, and no problem. This further shows their intent to deceive customers.

I had originally ordered a coffee milk tea with zero sugar. I asked upfront if this is possible, and was told that it was. When the drink came out, it tasted lightly sweetened to me so I asked if they had accidentally added sweetener to it. I was told that their coffee is an instant coffee mix that already has sugar in it by default. Ok...that would've been nice to know before I ordered and paid! I think they're hoping that you either won't try your drink before leaving or that you'd be too polite to complain and/or ask for a remake!

By now I was slightly irritated. I asked them to remake my drink as a plain milk tea with zero added sugar. I figured this was safe because they wouldn't have to add any additional powders or flavors to it. After all, it's just plain milk tea right? Is it too much to ask for just some traditional black tea and cream? 

The girl then goes to the back and comes back with a small sample cup full of milk tea. She told me that I should probably try their milk tea first before they make my drink because in her opinion, the milk tea is SWEETER than the instant coffee. I thought this was an odd request but indulged her nonetheless. 1 sip and I almost spit it out. Wow, their milk tea really is sweet. Who needs it THAT sweet? You might as well go drink a soda because that's how sweet it was. I was then told their milk tea drinks are all pre-sweetened and then they add additional sweeter if the customer asks for an adjustment. 

By now my blood was boiling. How can you operate a tea shop if everything is premade? And also, why the heck didn't you mention this earlier when I was ordering? I specifically had asked if it was possible to get my drink unsweetened! And that was before I saw the sign on the counter showing that adjustments of 0% to 100% are possible! 

I had to use every fiber in my body not to scream, I was so mad! I was about to ask for a refund when another girl came out of the back. She told me that everything is indeed pre-sweetened and that the only thing they could give me that had zero sugar added at all was their cold brew coffee. After the ordeal I had just went through, I asked her if she was sure. Once she confirmed for the 2nd time, I gave the ok to make a cold brew coffee as my drink. Finally I was given a drink that tasted like no sugar was added to it. 

Long story short I would not recommend this place. If you do come though, be sure to take advantage of the Yelp check-in offer of 10% off which is the same as their UNLV student discount if you have a UNLV ID"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"My mom was in town so I decided to give this place a try to see how authentic their Taiwanese beef noodle soup is. This place is alright and overpriced for the quality of food and in comparison to other places we've been to. We ordered 4 items to share between the 2 of us since it was our first time here: wonton soup, beef tendon noodle soup, chicken over rice, and a mixed appetizer plate.

Wonton soup: Decent flavor and a good number of wontons were the highlights, but nothing to really rave about. It was tastier than I had expected it to be and for $5.99 I wouldn't mind ordering it again, but again nothing to rave about

Beef tendon noodle soup: Probably the best dish we ordered, although it's a little pricey for 10 bucks IMO. The soup had good flavor, wasn't too spicy and the tendon was chewy and not overcooked. They also gave a pretty generous portion of beef tendon which was surprising

Chicken over rice: This dish was terrible...so dry and overcooked that I barely ate 1 of the 3 pieces of chicken and then boxed the rest up, hoping I would eat it later...we'll see. The chicken is fried and they over over fried this thing...it's so dry, a bag of chips has more moisture than it! Very disappointing to get this dish after dealing with an incident with someone else getting our order (more on that below). $7.99 for this entree is a rip when you compare it to the other ones in our order that were actually edible.

Mixed appetizer plate: Forgot what this dish is actually called but it was a mix of beancurd, beef tripe or tendon (not entirely sure) in some kind of chili oil. It was good but man $6.95 is highway robbery for a dish of this size...but I think it's pretty common pricing in Vegas....miss all the reasonably priced appetizers and entrees in Texas!

Our order all arrived separately throughout our meal and on 4 different occassions. While we were still waiting on the chicken over rice, we heard the table next to us complain about receiving the wrong order. Apparently he had received our chicken dish instead of his pork chop dish since they delivered it to the wrong table...problem is, he had already touched and dug his chopsticks into the food although he hadn't actually eaten it...The waitress looked at us and asked if it was ok to re-serve this plate to us! WTF, ARE YOU SERIOUS?! First of all, I'm sure there some kind of health regulation against this, but if not, it's just downright gross! We told them hell no and that if they did it'd be wrong. So they took the dish back to the kitchen and said they'd bring us a new one. After discussing amongst ourselves we decided to go up and tell them that they could cancel that item off our order because we didn't want it since we were suspicious that they were going to re-serve us the entree. They told us that they would never to such a thing and that they were working on making a new one. Problem is, once they took it to the back we couldn't see what happened to it and for all we know they just re-served it to us. It was a terrible dish anyways in the end which made it even more disappointing.

Not sure if I'll come back in the future, but the only thing really worth getting here is their beef noodle soup. As you can tell, service is terrible here but it's a traditional Asian owned restaurant so what can you expect? They're CASH ONLY as well so be sure to have some paper on you to cover the tab at the end."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"Was here last night with a large group for a birthday party. It was my second time here and at first I was excited to be back based on my experience the first time around. I was shocked to find customer service and quality control so horrendous this second time around! Long story short, this place has totally gone downhill and I likely won't be back. I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time coming here either unless you want your food to come out an hour late and then take a half hour at the end to pay your group's tab!

Rachel and I got here about 40 min before our party's reservation so we decided to sit at the bar for some drinks and salad as an appetizer. After being greeted by the bartender we didn't see him again for another 15 min and sat around waiting for our order to be taken. What bartender doesn't ask for a drink order right away?

After everyone placed their orders we proceeded to wait about 45-50 min before any of food even came out. I was wondering if it was even going to come out at all! When our food arrived they brought everyone's except Roger's with no explanation of any kind...it was almost like the forgot that he had ordered anything. When this was brought to the server's attention she checked on it and came back to inform us that they had just ""fired it up"" and that it would ""be out shortly"" with no further explanation of what happened to the original order, nor an apology. About 10-15 min passes before the server returns to inform us that Roger's steak would be out soon and that they had overcooked the original one. Funny how they would wait to tell us this instead of being up front about it...I call bs!

When Roger's steak finally came it was overcooked and not cooked medium rare like ordered. How hard is it for a steak restaurant to not overcook 2 steaks in a row?! After this debacle they still wanted to charge us for his steak at first and then decided not to in the end...I'm sure they heard that we were all Yelpers lol! But seriously this place is ridiculous. No updates on your food and no service whatsoever. It's almost like they don't care if their customers are happy or not, and we definitely were not.

At the end of the night we attempted to settle our table's tab. We had asked the server at the beginning of the meal to split our tabs, however, at the end of the meal she told us that this wasn't possible. WTF! Why didn't you just tell us that in the first place? The manager came out to explain that it was against store policy to split checks of groups with 6 or more people...Ok, so it's possible...you're just not going to do it? Who says that? Especially after the crap service we just endured? 

It was a debacle trying to figure out the tab due to this and they had to run about a dozen cards separately. I almost wanted our group just to leave because the servers didn't know what was going on, except that they couldn't split the tab. If it wasn't for the manager coming out to handle the situation I'm pretty sure it would've taken longer than 30 min to figure this out and I would've just left. I don't have the patience or time to deal with crap like this. Get your shit together or don't run business! We were also pissed to see a 20% auto gratuity which is bs because they deserve nothing

Save your time and your money and avoid this place. There are so many other steak places here in Vegas and there's really nothing special about this one. Steaks after overpriced just so they can do a ""happy hour"" 50% deal and even then the appetizers are $15, sides are $7 and sauces are $3.50 for such a crap place that's not even fancy at all."
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"On my most recent trip here, the food was good and the same as usual, but it was the service and management that really pissed us off and now I don't know if we will ever return...at least to this location. 

Our server was alright. There was a couple times where we couldn't find her but I'm thinking they were just understaffed that evening; it was during the holidays after all. When we were done with our meal, she seemed a little pushy on getting us to buy desserts even when we told her we were way too full and just wanted the check. She asked us to think about it and she'd come back. What the heck? Why can't you just bring the check? It seemed like she wanted us to give a definite answer of no before she was willing to print the check. Strike one.

When we finally received the check, we attempted to pay with an e-gift card that had $100 loaded on it and our meal was $91 including tax. When she brought the receipt for us to sign, she told us that we couldn't tip with the gift card and that we still had $8 or $9 remaining on the card, awesome...where's the gift card, could we have it back? The server refused and told us it was policy to keep our printed gift cards whether or not there was a remaining balance. WHAT? How does that even make sense? I will never be able to use the remaining balance then! We asked her to make a copy for us but she refused and told us to simply re-print one when we got home...problem is how do you do that when it was a gift and I already deleted the original e-mail?! No other business I've frequented has ever asked to keep a gift card, remaining balance or not without asking first if I wanted it back. She told me this is what her manager told her to do, which didn't really help the situation. I considered not leaving a tip since I just lost 9 bucks but ended up leaving a decent one and decided to take it up with management at a later date since it wasn't her fault and she was just doing what she was instructed to do.

I e-mailed the company about a week later and complained about my remaining balance that was lost because I was unable to get my gift card back and 2 days later received a phone call from one of the managers of the Vegas location. She stated that it was company policy to do this and the server indeed followed protocol. I was really angry and got in a heated argument with the manager about the policy since it doesn't really protect them from anything, while making it super inconvenient for customers and discourages them from buying and using gift cards. It wasn't the 9 bucks that I cared about, but the principle of what was going on that seemed fraudulent to me. I got nowhere with management and she continued to tell me that it was corporate policy. Ok, I guess I'll have to contact them to get more info then.

Then we contacted corporate customer service and was told that this was NOT corporate/company policy in any way, shape or form and that the store was mistaken and they weren't sure why. They ended up sending us a new link to re-print our gift card with the remaining balance and informed us that we would be receiving a phone call apology from the General Manager once they contacted him about the situation.

All in all, Bubba Gump Las Vegas is run by liars and they did nothing but inconvenience my family and then lie to me about it to back up their side of the story. It will take a lot for me to come back here in the furture, if I ever do. Just thinking about it gets me fired up and angry. I really hope they go out of business some day when this all catches up to them!

UPDATE (2/12/14): Well, it's been over a month and still haven't heard from the General Manager of Bubba Gump or received the apology I was promised. Worst customer service of any restaurant chain I've been to! Would never recommend this place to anyone"
zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,"Came last week for the grand opening special during lunch and thought it was ok. For about 12 bucks for AYCE Korean BBQ, the grand opening special is a great value and we thought the meats and some appetizers were really good, although service were a little lacking. Keeping in mind that this business is under new management, and there might be some kinks that need ironing out, I'm giving my experience a 3-star rating which was really difficult because...well...just read my review:

The interior is a little dated and it is super hot inside, most likely because there are grills on every table and everyone is grilling at the same time. Not sure if the big copper looking vents above each table work because they were silent, but I didn't think we smelled too bad after leaving which was good.

We got set up with a crystal grill top when we sat down that I thought was pretty cool and it definitely retained heat a lot better than a normal grill top and was non stick as well. I realized after talking to my friends that came on subsequent days that there were apparently 3 different types of grill tops but I think I would still prefer the crystal. I was still able to grill meat 15 min after the flame was turned off by one of the staff...this wouldn't have been possible on a traditional grill top. The secret is to wait until the crystal heats up before placing the meats on top. The staff did not allow us to heat up the grill after switching us out to a clean one and threw all our meat on top of the grill for us while it was still cold. This pissed us off, especially because we prefer to cook our own food and don't appreciate them butting in and grabbing our meat/tongs off the table, especially if they're going to screw it up and do it the wrong way. They also kept trying to serve us cooked meat with our tongs that had been used to touch and flip raw meat, making us a little uneasy. Not sure why they have to be so controlling!

Also, there appeared to be a language barrier and we were unable to get items that we needed such as napkins, water and sauce refills and additional orders. When the servers came by we attempted to communicate things that we needed each time. They would either have a confused look on their face or acknowledge us and then never return with the item requested. We asked about 4-5 times for more sauce before we got it. Same with napkins. One of the servers even blamed me for Michael K not having a plate even though she was the one that never brought him one! WTF! If I had to rate service alone, it'd be a 1 star rating for sure! Either bring a Korean speaking friend or expect to have to ask 4-5 times for everything you need.

Food quality was better than I had expected and the meats appeared fresh and well marinated. My favorites were the bone-in galbi and pork belly. Just don't let the staff see you cutting meat while it's raw or they will give you a lecture about waiting until it's cooked. Really? With scissors and tongs that have already been touching raw meat? This will also make them want to cook and serve your food for you....if I wanted that then I would have gone to Bennihana or something. 

With all the service issues I am not sure how they'll ever have a good customer service rating...because of this, they're definitely not worth more than their grand opening special and once their price goes back up to normal I would not come back or recommend this place because you'll be here forever trying to grill and eat just 2 plates of meat due to service issues and waiting on your orders, drinks, napkins, sauce, etc.

I also would not recommend doing both sushi and BBQ together...pick one or the other and sit at the designated section. Tony T sat with us in the room with all the table grills and it took him forever to get his sushi orders and some of them were wrong or confused for something else. If you want sushi, go sit at the sushi bar near the front door!"
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w, 
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I love Happy Lemon but I am not a huge fan of this location. I came here several times and the service has always been bad. 

One time I felt like I was being rushed to order. The other time I was dealing with somebody who doesn't know what a ""substitution"" was. I ordered a ""red bean pudding matcha latte"" which comes with red bean. I don't like red bean but they didn't have any matcha latte drinks that comes with both pudding and tapioca. I planned to substitute the red bean with tapioca so I told the cashier that.

The cashier told me there is a charge for the additional topping, and I replied to her that I am not getting the tapioca as an ""additional"" topping, I am getting a substitution. Then she replies it is my choice to remove the red bean that comes with the drink, but because I am requesting a different topping, there is a charge for the extra topping. This makes NO sense to me... it makes no sense that she is not allowing substitutions when both toppings are the same price....I told her why is there an extra charge when I am just switching the toppings and not getting an additional? 

Then she called someone in the back to ask and the other person said I can substitute the red bean with tapioca at no charge. Anyway, it was an unnecessary process and the cashier DID NOT APOLOGIZE. 

In conclusion, I really dislike this location for the service."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I always walk by this place and I finally decided to try it. 

My first impression is that they have very limited offerings. I usually go for pistachio but they did not carry it. I asked the server if they normally offer it and he said no because it's not a popular flavor. I was surprised because that's one of the most common flavors. Anyways, that's okay, I decided to go for ferrero rocher and strawberry. 

The gelato was good and it is on par with other gelato places in the area. Nothing exceptional. It's decent. In terms of pricing, I think it's similar to other gelato places as well. Overall for quality and price, I think it's about the same as other places. 

So I really don't have an incentive to purposely come here for gelato. I may get it if I pass by, but that is assuming they carry flavors I want on that day. It is so small with limited offerings, maybe the next time I pass by I will not see any flavors I like. I am not complaining since this is what they can offer given the size of the place. But it may be hard to attract all customers.

I don't think their primary focus is to attract everyone and be THE place for gelato. If people wanted gelato then they may go to a bigger store with tons of gelato flavors. 00 gelato is a small store that offers gelato conveniently while people are walking and it seems like they are doing well in that aspect."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I don't normally give 1 star but the service was horrible. I called in advance for takeout. It was for three of the ""rice rolls"". I went in to pick up 20mins after my call, and they said they don't have my order. As in, they couldn't find the slip. So my order was not there or in the process of making. They didn't apologize, the counter lady suggested that she will take the order at that moment and she said it should be about 10minutes. I was on the way going somewhere so I didn't want to wait but since it's just 10minutes, I agreed and paid. 

20minutes later, still not ready but I see many rice rolls coming out from the kitchen to serve the guests eating in. I asked the counter lady if mine is ready yet because I clearly see them coming out of kitchen. She says those guests ordered before me. BUT she forgot that I called in wayyyy advance but it was their fault they lost the ordering ticket. I was upset because I have been waiting way too long. 

The counter lady also said it's slow because they only have one steamer and many order steamed rice rolls in the morning. Well if this is true, why did she make that promise of saying it should only take 10minutes ? She only said that so that I buy and pay right away. 

I was very dissatisfied with the service . Never coming back. It was my first time, their rice rolls are just like any other rice rolls I had in the area."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"Sorry Bannock, you've been great at other times, but I am extremely disappointed in the Summerlicious lunch I had.

It wasn't planned to visit Bannock for Summerlicious but I was shopping on the weekend and I was nearby during their Summerlicious menu. 

USUALLY, when my food arrives at my table ordering from a Summerlicious menu, I get really excited because the food looks a lot better than the menu description. However, that was not the case for Bannock. It was the opposite. The first thing I noticed was how horrible the presentation was...isn't Summerlicious your chance to market your restaurant? The overall presentation of every dish was very simple, it looked rush, and it seemed like Bannock cared too much about efficiency for Summerlicious that they didn't care much about how it was presented to customers.

Onto the food, everything was mediocre. Best dishes that me and my friend had were the desserts probably.

Appetizer: We both ordered the tomato & fruit, it was alright, nothing special. I would suggest more leaves though.

Entree: The chicken that my friend ordered was mediocre, lacking in flavor, looks like it was buffet food. The burger I got was alright.

Desserts: The best dish out of the entire meal, I mean how can you go wrong with desserts! We got cinnamon donut with ice cream and fruit with whipped cream.

I enjoy Bannock for their main meal and their to-go sandwiches. But the Summerlicious offerings really let me down."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I came here with a friend after seeing reviews. It was Friday around noon.... horrible decision. We both ordered a shawarma meal and it took about 30minutes to get it. I was a bit bothered by the fact that there were some people who ordered after us got their orders first. At first I thought maybe those customers ordered something else which was quicker for the kitchen to replenish... but then I started paying close attention to the kitchen staff packing shawarma meals.. and customers who placed the order after us got their meals. I was thinking it was because me and my friend were sitting down and we don't look like we are in a rush? Well this is a bit unfair in my opinion. 

Onto the food, portions are large and one meal is heavy. I could not finish the entire meal. It's good portions and the food is decent. In all honesty, i think the food is decent but nothing wowed me. Nothing exceptional to make me return. But for the price and portions, i think it's a great place to grab food if I'm in the area. But not particularly a restaurant or a take-out place where I would go out of the way for. That being said, this restaurant is located in a tiny plaza and it's not near any major landmarks. So I highly doubt there will be a chance for me to be super near this joint to return. 

In conclusion, if you are nearby and you are looking for a place to grab take out (not sit in though because there's barely any seats) then I do suggest coming here."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I was looking for a restaurant to host a dinner for a group in the King West area and I chose Oretta only because they allow large groups to order from their regular menu unlike most other restaurants where they have groups order from a group menu (with limited choices) for a set price. 

My first impression of the restaurant is that it is lovely with bright colors. Love the ambience and the decor. 

Service: For groups, they seat you upstairs. The upper floor is great because it is more intimate and quiet. However, this also means there are less servers walking around. This shouldn't be an issue if the assigned server to the table is attentive though. In our case, our server wasn't very attentive and we rarely saw her after we got our food. After placing our orders and getting our entrees, there was no one around for us to request for more water. 

Food: The food was just an okay. I ordered the ravioli and it was extremely bland. The texture was nice but that was about it. I thought maybe it was just the ravioli that was mediocre here, but I tried my friend's squid ink pasta and I thought it was bland as well. 

Overall, I was disappointed in both the service and food. Again, I only chose this restaurant for dinner because they don't force groups to order from a set menu unlike other restaurants in the area. If I wanted to have an Italian meal, there are so many other options for Italian fare in the area and I would not choose to come back."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I came here for lunch during peak lunch hours on a weekday. The restaurant was really empty which was a sign to me that it's not that popular. 

Service: service was minimum and you press a button to call for them. This is a typical korean restaurant with buttons to call for service instead of servers walking around to serve you. 

Food: my group ordered a variety of dishes to share. 

Spicy volcano roll- this did NOT look like the picture at all. In the picture, they showed a bunch of rolls stacked up and there was a lot of scallops on top. But when they served it, it was not stacked up. Instead it was lined up with less toppings on it compared to the picture. We were misled to think that this roll had a lot of seafood given the price of $15. 

Roll combo B- this contained a California, spicy salmon and spicy tuna roll. This set was decent. 

Chicken- probably the worst dish out of everything we ordered. It was supposed to be """" which is a deep fried spicy chicken. This chicken dish is supposed to be really crispy which it wasn't. Also it was supposed to be spicy which it wasn't. It was more sweet than spicy. I felt like I was eating sweet and sour chicken. 

I gave this restaurant a try and it did not impress. It is a huge establishment and they are open 24hours. It is great if you want food late night. But if you looking for a restaurant in the area during daytime, there are endless restaurants in this strip serving much better korean food."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"This location is not convenient for me at all but I had to make an effort to visit when I found out that the menu here is completely different than the one at their downtown Toronto location. The menu here is chocolate inspired and I was curious to see their new offerings here! I was originally thinking the menu is full of chocolate soufflé pancakes with different toppings. The menu mainly consists of pancakes using the original pancake mix with chocolate inspired toppings/sauces. If you are seeking for additional flavor combinations on their fluffy pancakes, you now have the option to visit two Fuwa Fuwa cafes for more menu items!

Service:
It was slow and it was unreasonably slow. I know it takes time to prep the pancakes but it took much longer than needed to make the pancake. The service was also poor because the servers weren't attentive and they were really disorganized. Hopefully they can improve on that. 

Pancakes: 
I decided to go with the pancake with a white chocolate sauce which is the ""Matcha White Chocolate Pancake"". The pancakes are consistently soft and fluffy. The pancake itself wasn't too sweet and the white chocolate sauce complemented well with it. The overall flavor combination was nice. 

Overall:
I like their pancakes and I may visit if I am in the area. But I do not think I will necessarily go out of my way to come here to get a souffle pancake. I am pretty satisfied with the flavor combinations at their Bloor St location."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"This is small eatery inside a food court. Great place to grab some quick eats for cheap. 

I bookmarked this eatery for some time now and finally got a chance to try it. I came with a friend during dinner hours. We stepped inside and we stood there for a few minutes. Several waiters walked by us but nobody approached us. We were confused because this place looked very casual, so I wasn't sure if we grabbed our own seats (there were several empty tables) or we wait to be seated.

We kept waiting but none of the servers approached us. We finally asked a server we are waiting for a table, and she asked how many, and we told her we needed a table for two. Finally we got a table. The initial impression wasn't great because of the lack of service. 

Food:
Manpuku ramen (2.5/5) : This was okay, I generally prefer going to a ramen restaurant to get ramen. But I was curious to try it here. It was very bland, and I would definitely not order this again. 

Yakionigiri (3.5/5): This was my favorite item. The rice was crisp on the outside. A nice side dish to add to any order.

Yakisoba (3/5) : This was alright. A bit too salty though.

Takoyaki (2/5): I was looking forward for this the most, but this was actually the most disappointing dish out of everything we ordered. It wayy too sticky and heavy.

Overall, the food was okay. But I didn't expect anything great given its a casual eatery with cheap prices. I think it is a decent place to get quick Japanese foods."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I came here when there was a festival beside so it was extremely busy with a line-up to get in. I am not sure if this place is really that popular or if it was because people were coming from the festival. 

Service was extremely slow. I tried to order drinks and I had to wait a while to get them. There are also no washrooms so you have to leave to go to the nearby building to use the washroom. This was inconvenient because me and a friend left to go to the washroom, and then there was a line up to get in when we came back. We told the security that we were already inside and we only stepped out to use the washroom. He let us in without lining up. I think it would be great if they had a closer washroom. Also I think this was disorganized. How can they keep track of customers who left to go washroom and they are re-entering to those customers who just arrived. Any customer can skip the line by telling the security they only went to the washroom. I think they should have a better system. 

I only came for drinks. The drinks are overpriced and it was mediocre. It didn't even feel like there was alcohol. I got a sangria and it was disappointing for the price. I don't think people come here for the cocktails or drinks. They come here because it's situated in a nice area with a nice view. The view is great but it's not worth coming with the overpriced drinks, far washroom, and slow service. There are plenty of patios in Toronto with a nice view. So I have no reason to come back here."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I absolutely love cakes and I love earl grey cakes. I was happy to know there was a Millie cake place nearby this area and they had earl grey Millie cakes ! 

The cafe is on a tiny street without much parking available. It is located facing a condominium. I was surprised to see that they would locate it here since it's not that noticeable to the public. I would assume most who visit here is because they found the cafe from online sources. 

Service: the lady working there that day was very friendly and welcoming. She seemed very enthusiastic about the offerings. 

Food:
Earl grey Millie cake: this was delicious. I love earl grey and the most important king about earl grey desserts for me is the boldness of the tea flavor. This had a strong flavor and I just loved it. I devoured it. 

Matcha Millie cake: this also had a bold flavor of matcha. I enjoyed this one as well but I'm usually not a huge matcha person so I preferred the earl grey more. 

Thai iced tea gelato: for anyone who likes Thai iced tea, this is a must. I never had a Thai iced tea flavored gelato so I wanted to try. It was very creamy.

Pandan gelato: this was a very refreshing gelato that went well wit my Thai iced tea gelato. However this gelato was a lot less creamy.  

I had a great time coming here for desserts. If you do come though, you may risk not getting specific flavors. I came an hour before their closing time and they were sold out of the tiramisu which I was also interested in trying. So make sure you come earlier if possible !"
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"********** I rate this place 0/5 stars. **********

This is by far the worst Smoke's Poutinerie I've been to. Not only is the worst smokes, it's just terrible in general as a restaurant. 

Service started out bad. The food made my experience worse...

Service:
When me and my friend came here for a late night snack, there were 3 people working there. They all seemed very busy on the phone and it looked like they were trying to complete their online orders from ubereats or foodora. I saw them laying out a lot of food orders, yet there were just a few other customers in the store at that time so it must be online orders. 

As me and my friend were about to place our order, the cashier just ""wait please give me a few minutes""... because he was on the computer inputting phone/online orders... so we were just standing there....when the cashier was finally done inputting online orders, he took our order without any apology for having us wait and implying to us that online orders were his priority and not us. 

Food:
While we were waiting, another customer in the store said the poutine barely had any gravy...

When we got our poutine, we realized how dry the poutine was and we had to request for more gravy too. Seems like this franchise location of smokes likes to skimp out on ingredients.

Conclusion: 
I will NEVER get poutine from this location of smokes. I also recommend everyone to avoid this location. Save yourself some money and go to another location. If you're only in this area then just get food from elsewhere."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I was nearby and searched bubble tea. I found out through Yelp there is a new shop and I wanted to check it out. So I purposely came go this plaza to try pop up. I was with a friend and we both ordered a bubble tea with a waffle each. 

The owner was really passionate and friendly. He was explaining the options we had, such as having two flavors in a cup, or how we can choose from a variety of toppings etc. I can tell he really wants to be nice to his customers and he puts in time to communicate with them. 

After we paid, we were told there would be a 20-30 wait for our order. We ordered two drinks and four waffles in total. Me and my friend were surprised because we never had to wait this long for HK egg waffles before. We sat outside the store, hoping it would be ready around 10minutes or so. But nope. We literally waited 25minutes for our order for drinks and waffles.

Given the wait, I think it is hard for the shop to sell a lot of items because they are not making their products as efficient as their competitors. It seems like a shop that will cater to kids as they wait for their parents to grocery shop downstairs. But I can't see a reason why customers would purposely come into this plaza to purchase egg waffles with such a long wait time. Moreover, the quality of the items were not outstanding. Because the shop is on the second floor of a small shopping center, it may be hard to attract customers who aren't already in the plaza to come purposely all the way to the shop unless it has unique or high quality offerings."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"There aren't many dessert shops and chocolatiers in Markham/Scarborough area compared to downtown. For lava cakes and crepes, 0109 is one of the few that offers it in this area. I think 0109 is nice for desserts if you live in the area and you want a break from chinese desserts. However, if I lived in another city, I will not come to Markham/Scarborough area for cakes and crepes. 

I came here once when it was really new, it was really long ago. I still remember it was very dark and cozy. But I came back recently and the ambience changed. It is more bright now, looking more casual than before. 

Service: Service was great. Servers were attentive and brought water. It also wasn't very busy so it is easy for servers to keep an eye on all tables. 

Desserts: 

1) Matcha Lava Cake: I was excited to have this. I came on a chilly day and a lava cake was perfect to have on this chilly day. This was very disappointing. The cake was veryy DRY. It was like it was pre-made and then they warmed it up. I had a matcha lava cake before somewhere else at another dessert shop in uptown and it was delicious. But the one here was dry and it wasn't a nice cake in general. The cake also lacks in matcha flavor. I would rate this 2/5

2) Crepe: Lindt chocolate cake with added strawberries and bananas. Plus a scoop of cappuccino gelato. This was decent. I loved the gelato, it stood out from the crepe itself. It had a strong flavor and it was really creamy. I would rate this 3/5

Overall, I am not sure if I would come back for cakes/crepes. Nothing stood out to me to give me a reason to return."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"This was in a quieter area. The restaurant was really empty when I came on a weekday. They have a small patio area that is facing a small street. We were seated immediately but no one gave us the menus until 5 minutes later. The service was really slow despite the fact that it was early in the evening without many customers. I noticed they were training some employees that day, so only a few were serving the entire restaurant.

Appetizers: Me and my friends tried a few appetizers and we loved every single one of them.The arancini was great, it was so cheesy and the tomato sauce packed enough flavor. My favorite appetizer is definitely the chicken liver mousse though. The mousse was very flavorful and so smooth. The jelly with the mousse added a nice touch. Next best appetizer is the beef crudo. The aioli served with the beef crudo was amazing, and the beef crudo tasted so fresh overall. I say the chicken liver mousse and the beef crudo are a MUST GET here! 

Mains: The pasta we ordered was SOO SALTY! My group kept waving our server for more water. I hope all their pasta isn't like this, it could be the particular one we got. But the pasta was disappointing. The noodles were cooked nicely, but the sauce was just too salty. We also ordered a side dish of green beans which were alright.

In conclusion, I love the food here. The prices are decent. But I would probably stay away from the pasta that we got this time. Perhaps I will try another pasta next time. The service was slow and my table didn't get much attention from our server. I would have rated it higher if there was better service."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"More and more asian fusion restaurants are opening in Markham. I was excited to try NextDoor and see how it compares to other restaurants offering asian fusion. 

I came on a weeknight, the restaurant was extremely empty. My group was one of the two tables in the dining area. 

Service: the service was quick. Food came out quickly and our server was attentive. 

Food:

Roasted Bone Marrow- This was a bone marrow item topped with beef tartare. I was really disappointed in this item. I was hoping to have a bone marrow dish with beef tartare as a topping, but all I could taste was the beef tartare. I couldn't even see any bone marrow. The beef tartare was also just an okay. 

Fried Brussel Sprouts- I love brussel sprouts so I had to get this. The dish was way too sweet with the maple balsamic vinaigrette. I like how they are trying to be different, and the flavor was nice. However, I found it wayyy too sweet. 

Duck Wings- This was probably the best item I had. The duck wings were crispy and the sauce was flavorful. 

Roasted Lamb Leg- This dish came out quite cold. Since the lamb pieces are placed on the tzatziki, this may have cooled the meat before it is served to customers. This dish had vegetables on hummus and the lamb is on the tzatziki. I did not like this dish at all. The lamb was very bland and everything didn't go well together.

Overall I did not have a good experience at NextDoor. The food was mediocre. Food came out cold and I didn't find the flavors in each dish went well together. Also the bone marrow barely had any bone marrow. I had high hopes but I left with disappointment."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I honestly don't understand how this ramen joint have customers when there are so many other ramen places nearby for customers to choose from. I am not saying their food is that bad, but their service is...

This joint is fairly big compared to other ramen places nearby, they can seat a lot during peak hours. I came here during peak lunch hours and I was surprised we were seated immediately given the fact we had a big group. 

We were seated immediately, however, what is the point of being seated if you are not given a menu to order? My group sat down for a few minutes...no water and no menus...we waved down a server to ask for the menus, he looked at us and acknowledged. But he got too busy and forgot, or maybe our group wasn't his priority during peak hours. My group asked another server to bring menus, and he finally brought menus. But, he brought 4 menus for a table of 10. Are the servers that busy or lazy to serve us? He expects 10 people to share 4 menus, which will slow down ordering even more. The service was just that bad and I wanted to leave already.

Anyways, we ordered and got our food. The ramen here is okay. I don't find it that great. The broth was okay. I've had ajisen in the past and it was decent, but maybe not this location. Not surprised because they are so lazy to give us enough menus, and to serve us properly. I will not be surprised if they slack on the food quality too. 

The lunch was filled with horrible service (or minimum service). Even at the end when we were asked to pay upfront at the counter, the manager/boss had no smile and she was rushing everyone. 

I will never return here."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I have been loving this location ever since I found out they opened a Captain's Boil in Mississauga. I have to say, this location is huge and it looks a lot nicer than most of the other locations I've been to. Upon entering is the bar area with TV screens and I think it is a nice casual spot to grab a drink while watching a sports game. After the bar area is the seating area. The seating area is huge with many tables and booths. There is a also a party room in the back.

Service: 

I have visited this location several times and the service has always been consistently great. The servers are always welcoming and friendly. 

Food:

Torced mussels-I love this appetizer, it is cheesy and flavorful. It is a nice appetizer to get before the mains. 

Lobster roll- Me and my friend wanted to try this. I love their version of the lobster roll. It isn't creamy but rather mildly spicy. Everything went together well.

Cajun fries- I love fries and I think cajun fries is a staple item here. It goes well together with the seafood boil and I highly recommend ordering this as a side. 

Seafood boil-I have ordered king crab legs, snow crab legs, shrimp, mussels, clams, and crawfish. The seafood always tastes fresh, so picking which ones depends on personal preference. My favorite sauces include the garlic and the captain's boil signature sauce (a blend of the 3 sauces). I normally get the signature sauce though because I think it is a good combination of the other sauces, you can't go wrong with that!  

Overall I highly recommend checking this location out. It is spacious and clean. Perfect spot for gatherings or just stopping by to grab a quick drink at the bar."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I absolutely love tteokbokki and I was so excited when I found out this restaurant opened up in North York!

The atmosphere is casual and they have two floors. It has a modern design with bright furniture. I came here for lunch on a weekend and it was really empty. Other than my table, there was only one other table occupied. 

Service: The service was friendly. The waiters were very attentive and refilled our water frequently. 

Food: The menu had other items in addition to just rice cakes. They have side items that compliment the rice cake sauce. For the rice cakes, you can choose between several types of sauces. Then you can order additional side items to dip into the rice cake sauce. 
 
I opted for the rose sauce since it is a blend of both a cream sauce and the red sauce. I ordered the rose rice cakes with bacon and I added ramen noodles to it. I also wanted some additional items to dip into the rice cakes so I ordered a platter of the fried stuff. The platter of fried stuff came with gimmari, dumplings, and potatoes. The rose rice cakes was nice. The sauce was thick and flavorful. The rice cakes were chewy. There were a lot more sauce compared to the amount of rice cakes given. I think this is their strategy to encourage customers to order side items to dip into the sauce. The fried platter was typical. I was actually very surprised that the fried stuff went well with the rose sauce. Originally I thought it might be weird since I am so used to dipping fried foods in the traditional spicy red sauce. I didn't expect the fried foods to go well with a creamy sauce. 

I absolutely love rice cakes so I will most likely return whenever I want a snack."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I came here on a weekday and it was really quiet and the service was adequate. 

Drinks: I started off with a cold vietnamese coffee. It tasted great. But I felt like 80% of my cup was ice cubes and there was barely any coffee for $3.50 so I will probably order the hot version next time. 

Food: My friend got the special beef pho. Nothing spectacular, it is just like any other beef pho. I ordered the grilled pork chop platter with steamed egg and fried egg. The pork chop was tender. 

The food was decent but I will NOT return based on how unethical this business is. They intentionally increase the price of the grand total when they hand you the total bill thinking that customers do not notice...

They add tips to the total of the bill without informing customers. The paper bill just says ""total"" and the total amount. It does not include any calculation. Most customers will assume this total amount is just the subtotal with taxes. But NOPE, it includes tips. This is very unethical of this business. I know they are intentionally doing it because I paid with cash, and they gave me change and it was my natural instinct to leave a tip. Afterwards I thought to myself that the ""total amount"" on the bill didn't seem very right, so I grabbed my phone out to do the calculations and I realized they actually increased the ""total amount"" written on the bill. I was already in my car when I realized I had in fact gave them tips TWICE without realizing and they accepted it. This business is very sneaky and I don't appreciate their way of doing business. I highly advise everyone to calculate the total amount on the paper bill because they definitely increase the amount."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I came here for a birthday with a large group. The majority of the group arrived 5-10minutes before the reservation time. We were told the table wasn't ready yet. We didn't get our table until it was a few minutes past the reservation time. I already had a bad impression at this point because they didn't have our table ready by the reservation time and the entire group was just standing in the front area blocking other customers. I would expect them to prepare the table before customers come, but nope.

Our table had 20 people and it was divided into three separate tables. This is probably to make it easier for guests to get in/out. When our server brought out bread for the tables, she only brought out two baskets of bread so one table didn't get any bread until they asked for it. Also, we were only assigned one server for a group of 20. 

Food: I ordered the sirloin with the mushroom sauce and fries. I did not like the fries at all because they were so thin and it was like eating strings of oil. The steak was mediocre and bland even when I dip it into the sauce. I had to add salt and pepper on my steak. I tried my friend's prime rib and it was mediocre. 

Not only was the food mediocre but the service was horrible. They brought out my friends birthday cake when some people still had steak on their table... this is probably a sign to us that they were closing and they want us to hurry up. They literally brought the cake out with small plates and placed it on the table for us... I thought this was rude because some people are still finishing their entree. 

Given the service and food. I will definitely not return and I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"The restaurant is modern and bright. It isn't as busy as some of the other ramen shops. I didn't have to wait very long to get seated which was nice. There were several servers walking around but they didn't seem very welcoming or friendly. They looked as if they were always rushing. The service can be improved.

Their menu had many pages. Nice to see that they offer a page dedicated to vegetarians. Also there is an allergy information page, and this easily shows you what you can eat if you have any food restrictions. 

Food:

Spicy Tan Tan - since it didn't have meat or egg, I added one slice of cha shu and an egg. If you like BOLD flavors, this is probably the best choice. The broth was very thick. It was packed with minced crab and the texture of the soup was like bisque. It was like a bisque with the noodles. This soup has a strong seafood taste if that's what you like. The noodle comes with thin noodles but I think I would prefer thick noodles with a thick broth like this. 

Spicy Miso - surprisingly this broth was very watered down. All I could taste was spice but no other flavor. This came with thick noodles.  

Overall:
I didn't like either of the spicy miso or the spicy tan tan. The spicy miso is bland while the spicy tan tan was packed with flavor. However, I personally didn't like the strong crab flavor of the spicy tan tan. 

Also, the prices here are steeper than other restaurants. Each bowl of ramen is approximately $15 and this is without cha shu or egg. For example the spicy tan tan is almost $15, if you add one slice of cha shu for $1.50, plus an egg for $1.50, your bowl of ramen is $18. It is pretty expensive to pay nearly $20 for a bowl of ramen and I honestly don't think it was worth it. I think this place is overhyped."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"There are many noodle joints popping up around this area and Artisan noodles is one of the newer Chinese noodle restaurants in the area. The restaurant is along Yonge and it is in a busy area. One thing I really don't like is the size of this place. It is so tiny and you will most likely have to wait when you come. I really do enjoy their food but I try to avoid it during peak times because I just know there's probably not enough seats. They have some bar seating but it is extremely uncomfortable because the server is always walking by. Moreover, the bar chairs do not have back support so there is nowhere to hang my jacket. If you ever visit the restaurant, you will understand how uncomfortable the bar seats are.

Service: 
The service is minimal. Servers come to you when requested. The food comes out fairly quickly most of the time. Sometimes they have takeout orders which can slow the overall service down. The servers are sometimes rude and they seem like they are rushing you to order, eat, and get out. This is most likely because the seating is so limited and they want a quick turnover. I have had unpleasant experiences with the servers here. I do think they need to be more professional and always maintain friendliness to their customers.

Food:
I have had several dishes here and I like their food in general. Everything is tasty and I have not had anything I disliked. I have a preference towards dry noodles over soup noodles so my favorite is the Yo Po Mian.

Yo Po Mian - this is a mixed noodle. I usually ask for extra spice because I think it tastes much better when it is spicy. I love this noodle because the meat sauce is flavorful. For anyone who enjoys dry spicy noodles, I would highly recommend this.

Overall:
If you love noodles, I think this is a great spot worth checking out."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"Scaramouche has been one of my favorite French restaurants in Toronto for the past few years. I love the ambience and the food here. I recall during my first visit here, I was a bit surprised that this restaurant was in an apartment building. However, the view is nice from the restaurant. Although the restaurant is normally full, the ambience is still nice and relaxing.

Service:
The service is always friendly and welcoming. I do feel like the service downgraded compared to before or maybe I just didn't get a good server during my most recent visit. Previous times, I remember the servers were very attentive and my glasses were never empty. Also, the servers (previously) would explain each dish in details as they bring it out. During my most recent visit here, the server did not do this at all. My server during my most recent visit was friendly but he was just rarely available... I am not sure if they changed their service or if it was just my server that night. 

Food:
The food here is amazing! I love both their food and desserts. I love foie gras and the foie gras here is amazing! It is very rich in flavor and it is always so nicely presented. 

For entrees, I really like their seafood dishes and my go-to is the scallop entrée. The dish is beautifully presented. What I like most about their food is the sauces on every dish. All the sauces are so rich and flavorful. I never had a disappointing dish here. Their meat dishes taste great too but I personally prefer their seafood dishes. 

In terms of dessert, I always order the coconut cream pie. The cream is delicious! It is a heavy dessert so I do recommend this to be shared. 

Overall:
Scaramouche still remains one of my top French restaurants in Toronto. The food is amazing and it is also a nice place to celebrate a special occasion. I highly recommend this restaurant if you love French food and you haven't been here yet!"
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I heard great things about BKK and I wanted to try it for some time. I was aware that they now have two locations but I wanted to visit the original location on my first visit. I have passed by this restaurant many times and I was aware that there is limited parking. If you are driving to the restaurant, please note that there are barely any spots in this tiny plaza. There are only a few spots and some of the parking spots are reserved for other businesses in this plaza. You will definitely not be able to park for free in the plaza and will probably have to find parking elsewhere. 

I came early without reservation knowing that this place is small and there are limited seating. I was lucky enough to get a table without waiting but I would advise to reserve because customers who stepped in after me were not able to get a table since it is a small restaurant with very few tables. 

Service:
The service was quick and efficient. I generally find that the servers are more attentive in smaller restaurants because they can view all the tables easily. Our server was very friendly and checked up on us regularly which I appreciated. 

Food:

Chicken Wings - This was very flavorful and the chicken wings were very crispy. I absolutely loved the spice on the wings. This was labelled to be spicy on the menu and it was definitely spicy. 

Pad Thai - I was looking forward to this the most as this dish is highly rated on Yelp reviews. However, I found the noodles bland overall and it wasn't as flavorful as I would like. I requested this to be ""extra spicy"" but it actually wasn't spicy at all. I had to ask for extra chili flakes to add flavor to my noodles.

Green Curry - The consistency was concerning as it was extremely watery. It wasn't thick at all and the rice did not absorb the sauce well. 

Overall:
I loved the wings but I was disappointed in the entrees. I cannot say I love BKK but it wasn't a bad meal either."

The service was horrible. We made a reservation and we were told there is a time limit of 1.5hours which is actually not a lot of time. My friend and I felt like we would have to rush through our dinner. 
Now, for restaurants that give a time limit to customers, the servers need to be efficient too or else it doesn't make sense to kick customers out if the servers are slow.... 

So the only time we saw our server was when she came to take our orders and to give us our food. She never checks up on us frequently to replenish water, or when we required more chili oil for the bland noodles. We constantly had to wave other servers down for more water...This was quite irritating because if restaurants set a time limit on the seating, why should customers get kicked out when the servers are slow to bring us what we need?

Food:

Minced Pork Salad (Laap Lao) - this was a national dish of Laos and it was amazing.  It is a nice appetizer since it is so fresh and the herbs in the dish really stood out. This dish does get messy because you are using tiny lettuce leaves to wrap minced pork. Also, it would have been better if they provided more lettuce with the dish.  

Crispy Fried Fish - I love the batter of the fried fish because it was lightly battered and it didn't taste too heavy. The tangy tamarind sauce that came with it was light and it went well with the fried fish. 
Deep Fried Garlic Shrimp - This was delicious! It wasn't too battered and it went well with the sauce that comes with it. I will most likely order this again. 

Drunken Noodles (Pad Kee Mao) - I was disappointed in this dish. There wasn't a lot of meat or any other toppings, it was mostly noodles. The noodles were also bland. I requested chili oil to add flavor to it. But then it will just taste like chili and I couldn't really taste the noodles. I was expecting the noodles to be more flavorful but it wasn't.

Coconut Sorbet - This was a nice dessert to finish off our meal. It was light and refreshing. The coconut flavor was definitely noticeable and I enjoyed this. 

In conclusion:

Good food but HORRIBLE service. I really don't like the slow service here while they give you a time limit of 1.5hours... Based on this, I would probably not come back."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"It was my first time in Vegas and I wanted a hotel that wasn't near the end of the strip. Paris was a good location with great restaurants. There was Mon Ami Gabi and Gordon Ramsay steakhouse.

My initial impression of the hotel when I walked in was that it looked pretty cool. I loved the ceiling of the casino area. It's quite nice how many details are created to resemble Paris. The check in counter was beautiful with all the chandeliers. 

So why 4 stars and not 5? I felt that the hotel was disorganized in their booking system and this affected the check in process. On the night my party arrived, we went to the express machines at check-in but they weren't working. So we lined up and there weren't many counter representatives so the line was quite long. Can't really complain since I know it's Vegas and other hotels could be just as busy.

My issue with the checkin is because my room was not available ... and I arrived at 11pm which is wayyyy later than the allowed check in time so my room should already be prepared. My room was booked ahead of time online. They did not prepare a room. Why was it not ready? How can a hotel like this be so disorganized? The staff who was checking my party in had to check the system which rooms were available at the price we paid. So we waited ...  then she tells us there is a room available with one king bed. But we booked a room with TWO beds, two queen beds. She said both rooms are about the same price. But it's not about the price. This is about customer needs. We (customers) paid for a room with 2 queen beds. If they overbooked a standard room then they should offer an upgraded room with 2 queen beds, not another room with 1 bed. I'm confused why she thinks we would take that offer when we paid for a room with 2 beds. 

Anyways. She made a call to see if there were any rooms left with two queen beds (which we booked and paid for in advance) and there was. So we got our room finally.

I was disappointed how can Paris hotel not have an available room which was booked and paid for. You would expect their system is accurate and they would not have such issues. 

Other than the horrible check in process, I think the hotel is nice. The housekeeping staff are friendly and they did a great job. I hope they improve on their check in process."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"The food here was never exceptional to me and it was never one of my top choices for good French cuisine. I come here only because the location is great and I like the ambience. However, after my most recent visit, I will most likely NOT return. The service was extremely unwelcoming.

I came with a friend without reservation and we were seated immediately. We were here pretty early in the evening and there was only one other table occupied in the dining area. Our server approached us and we ordered some cocktails to start off the evening. When our server gave us our cocktails and asked if we would like order food, we told him we will order food later on but we just wanted to catch up over cocktails first. 

Literally five minutes later, he comes back and asks if we are ordering food...

At this point I was confused if he had forgotten that we told him literally five minutes ago that we are catching up over some cocktails and will order food later on. So we told him again that we are just having cocktails now and we will order food after our first round of drinks. Then he replies ""well if you guys are just having drinks, we have the bar area. The dining area is reserved for customers who are eating"". So at this point, I am obviously irritated. We told him several times we ARE going to order food but it was really early on in the evening and we wanted to enjoy cocktails first.

It seems like this server really wanted to ensure that customers dining in his area will order food because he wanted more tips. It was extremely rude and unwelcoming when he told us there was a bar area. Just because we didn't order food immediately, he was afraid we won't order food and he wanted us to move to the bar area. Also, the dining area was very empty. There were only 2 tables occupied at the time we were there. I don't understand why our server was in such a rush to have us order food.

In conclusion:
To sum it up, our server was very unwelcoming by telling me and my friend that there was a bar area for customers who are just ordering drinks. This was after several attempts telling him we WILL order food after our first round of cocktails. He didn't welcome us to sit in the dining area because he was afraid we will not order food and he will not get as much tips as the entrees cost more than drinks."
eZeBuiVZWT7u3SktO7mv9w,"I was in shock with food here...the food was extremely disappointing. For prices that are on par with most mid-range Italian restaurant, the food was horrible.
 
I came here with reservations and we were seated immediately. It was during dinner hours but they only had one staff serving all the tables. With just one server, the service was really slow from bringing us the menus and taking down our orders. 
 
Service:
 
The service was slow since they don't have many staff. 
 
Food:
 
My friend and I ordered two appetizers and two entrees to share. Out of the four items we ordered, only one of the item was decent with the rest being disappointing. 
 
N'duja bruschetta - We were deciding to order a bruschetta and opted for this one because it was different. The menu described this to be a bruschetta with a spicy pork sausage spread drizzled with honey. Although I was aware that this was going to be just a spread on bread, it looked disappointing when it arrived to the table because the spread was so thin. I was expecting something thicker to give it more flavor.  I also looked at other tables bruschetta and it looked very average.
 
Calamari Fritti - Another disappointing appetizer. When this arrived, I was a bit shocked because it didn't even look like there was batter... When my friend and I tried it, we both agreed that there wasn't enough crisp. The dish didn't look appetizing either.  
 
Gnocchi Gorgonzola - I wanted to try the gnocchi since the menu states they are handmade. The pasta came out and I thought the color was unappealing; it was like a greenish/greyish color. I guess it is because this sauce is a nutty creamy sauce. The texture of the gnocchi was chewy and nice. However, I wasn't a fan of the sauce.
 
Tagliatelle al Funghi Misti - This was AWFUL Some of the noodles were stuck together and this is the first time I've experienced this at a restaurant. The menu does mention this is a lighter sauce, and I thought it was a lighter flavor....but I didn't expect it to be less saucy.  There was BARELY any sauce actually.  The sauce was pretty much nonexistent and I felt like eating noodles in water. This pasta had no taste. It was $18 and it was literally just plain noodles without much sauce and flavor; the pasta was very dry. 
 
Overall:
 
I would never return. With most of their pastas ranging from $17-20, I was expecting similar quality to other restaurants in this price range. The tagliatelle was so dry and awful. The bruschetta also barely had any toppings on it."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"Soo.. it's a bad value tourist trap. WELL DUH. A touristy restaurant from NYC (land of ridiculous prices) lands on the Vegas strip (one of the most pricey and touristy places on earth), what did you expect? I have 0 sympathy for those that thought this overly cute place on the strip would be a place to get a good deal. It is what it is. A cute tourist trap that's fun to take the kids to (or kids at heart!). 

My fiance and I dined at the bar - not wanting to endure the 30 minute wait on a Tuesday night or dine outside in the 109 degree weather. We met some lovely people and loved our dining experience. Margaritas were buy 1 get 1 free (grab a coupon from the pink hair chicks outside) and were pretty good tasting and relatively strong. Service was attentive. The atmosphere doesn't suit me much (all the pink and flowers), but it's cute if youre into that sort of thing.

Now on to the food! Fiance had the shortrib pot pie and I had the ABC burger. The burger appeared to be on a pretzel like bun so i was disappointed to find sesame seeds and not salt on top (I'm a salt whore!). The burger was very tasty, but I wouldn't get it again. Next time I want a burger I'll stick to the burger specialty places on the strip (BLT, Strip Burger, Burger Bar) instead. Waffle fries were yummy. I'm rounding this up to 4 stars because my fiance adored his pot pie. Shortrib was awesome and the crust was flaky buttery goodness. 

I complained to the bartender I was too full to try the famous frozen hot chocolate so he made me a mini one for free! It was very tasty, but honestly if you order this you need to know you're drinking a freaking $10 milkshake. It's on the strip.. it's an experience.. it tastes good, but honestly I have yet to try a milkshake in my life that's worth $10. Being the alcoholic that I am.. I noticed they also have frozen hot chocolate concoctions with freaking booze in them! These were priced around $12 and seemed like a better deal (for some reason getting gauged on alcoholic drinks seems normal and totally ok!). Next time my eye is on one of those."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"I'm not going to waste time comparing this place to In-n-Out. They are completely different. period. I prefer a bigger meatier burger with mushrooms and bacon but everyone has their own personal preferences. 

The fries both here and at In-n-out dont' compare to the industrially-engineered unnatural (yet perfect) fries at Mcdonald's, but they are both natural fries and that's the way it is. They aren't great, the fries at in-n-out aren't great. I dont really eat many french fries so I don't care. 

My burger was perfection (I actually LOVE canned mushrooms so I'm so pumped they give me these included in the price), and the bacon and cheese and meat was all delicious. As an added plus, they have 100% beef Hebrew National hotdogs. You can get cheese melted on them too, or cheese and bacon. I split a yummy cheesy hot dog with my husband in lieu of fries ! 

So I'm taking a star off because I used their online ordering system so I could skip the lines. I pulled up to the extremely crowded, busy restaurant (they had 17 people working in the kitchen so they definitely weren't understaffed!), and told the order guy ""I'm Blair, I have a web order, do you know how I pick that up"". He gave me a clueless look then asked the manager. She fiddled around a bit and then said ""uh yeah, it's being made"". Ok, fair enough. The problem is even though i told him my name and that I ordered online, they only call the orders out by number. After he called ""43"" a whopping 5x, I asked him ""any chance that's for me"". He shrugged and handed me the bag- sure enough it said ""WEB ORDER - BLAIR"" in huge letters on top. Hey clown, when I tell you ""I'm blair, waiting for a web order"" maybe don't call it out by  number??!?!? How are web orders supposed to know we are order ""43""??? Call web orders out by name, idiot!

Anyways, despite my little web pick up mishap, the food was delicious and wonderful and I will be returning many times. I'm hoping because I went on their 2nd day of business they will iron out the issues (like internet orders) and when I return this week they will be better."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"I attended a fabulous Yelp elite event at H&R last night, but I'll base my review on a dining experience last week. The stand out feature of Herbs and Rye is really the atmosphere. The velvet wallpaper, copper walls, the cheesey electronic piano guy. I love it ! It was relatively empty on a Saturday night and quiet enough to carry on a conversation - my kind of place ! 

I tend towards the more girly on my drinks so I can't say the drink list was particularly appealing to me. That being said, if you're a rye drinker (as the name implies!), you'll love the drinks here. My Hemmingway daquari was decent, but not a drink I'd drive across town to drink again. 

As many have mentioned - the Happy Hour is insane. I love the fact that it goes till 8 PM (note, the Yelp hours are currently wrong at the time I'm writing this review). Tons of great food options on the HH menu:

*Chicken cordon bleu ($8) - chicken itself was deilghtful but the risotto it was served with was the worst risotto I've ever had ! It had a scoop shape like it had come out of a mold and it was really dry. Honestly good risotto shouldn't hold a mold shape, it should pool in a puddle of goodness on your plate. Minor detail.
*Ribeye ($15) - served with choice of 2 sides. Ribeye itself was very tasty. No, for $15 you're not getting the type of steak served at Cut, but it blows every other ""discount"" steak I've had in this town out of the water. Again the sides here weren't all that special. Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. Wouldn't pick either of those again despite those being my normal favorites. 
*On a sidenote I did try the flatbreads at the Yelp elite party and those were fabulous - even cold . I'll have to try one of those next time.

Served with dinner was delightful bread with the coolest butter I've ever encountered. It was honey butter with chives and parsely . Sounds gross, but the flavor worked for me. It was so intriguing ! 

Overall a great experience was awesome service. Fun atmosphere, great for a date or a group of friends. If they could get their sides up to snuff this is a 5 star place for sure."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"Sooo I'm just a normal person from the burbs. I decided to spend an evening at Tryst with a friend in from out of town to give her the Vegas experience. Maybe the things I saw were normal for all you California cool kids, but the whole evening was so bizarre to me!

Time in line: We had 2 girls, 1 guy in our party. We were dressed at about a 6 on the Vegas slutty scale so we had to wait like 8 minutes to get pulled out of line. Seriously if you have more chicks than guys expect to get pulled out.. not a big deal. Dudes are screwed.

Cover: $20 for us ladies, and $30 for our guy

Drinks: We drank double red bull vodka (kettle/sky depending on the bartender). They were $21 and not a bad deal because seriously 2 was enough to get us feeling really really good. 

Dance floor/Ambience: So it was crowded in there, but from talking to club going type people they say that's normal.. ok sure. I thought it was very beautiful, just smaller than I expected. 

Music: A nice mix of 80's/trance/hip hop/alternative.. whatever. My only issue is that each song was only played in a 1 minute clip. Is our society that ADD that we can't handle an entire song? Are entire songs not trendy? Seriously I was sooo getting into singing Living on a Prayer (singing in Tryst is probably a no-no) and then it cuts to some random rap song from the 90's... my drunk self was so sad.

Bathroom: So the bathroom line was weird. While I was in line these bouncer guys escorted these 2 really slutty chicks to the front and waited for them then escorted them back out... hrm.. so apparently there's some sort of VIP bathroom service? weird.

Weirdest thing of the night: Not one but TWO tables of douche bag guys decided it was cool to throw $100 worth of ones in the air. These were independent occurances. WTF, seriously I know it's just $100 but there are so many more interesting ways to burn through it. They were photographing each other doing this, and thought they were the sh*t cause they were throwing money on the ground.. seriously Vegas attracts some really mentally ill douche bag types. 

Overall clubs aren't my scene, but I had a nice time."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"Having trouble deciding on 4/5 stars... after reading over my individual dish reviews, I think I'm going to round down based on the number of dishes that didn't blow me away. 

Here's what I tried last night:

rolls: go for the salty mini dinner rolls. YUM, but I'm a sucker for bread with salt on it.

Foie gras: excellent. Last night's preparation was seared, but during the summer they had a cold terrine style... I'm more of a fan of the seared myself. The cold one doesn't do it for me. 

Hawaiian Tuna: honestly just *eh*. It was the most eh thing I ate last night. I'm pretty picky about fish/sushi and this one wasn't spectacular. 

Butter poached crab: OMG amazing. Totally buttery and rich (luckily I split it, so I only consumed like 2000 calories in my half.. lol). It comes with homemade amazing pasta, and some awesome diced fuji apples that really enhance the overall flavor profile . Really awesome dish. 

Blue cheese souflee: honestly I feel this dish is overrated. Yummy, but if the watier convinces you that you MUST try this or something, they are overselling it. I've had it 2x now.. and while I enjoyed it both times, I would tell you to get the crab instead . 

Sturgen: one of the choices on the $65 3 course menu. I only tried a bite of this one and I didn't love it. It was sitting in a sort of chowder, and the whole dish just tasted kinda like fish water almost.. I can't explain it, but it really wasn't doing it for me. 

Pork loin: Another choice from the 3 course menu. This is the right choice ! VERY lean pork, awesome flavor.. huge portion. Most things at BO are tiny, but this is very shareable. 

Scallops: YUM! Great flavor, great exotic things hanging out on the plate (interesting foams, weird veggies, etc). Perfect amount of char on the edges... a great choice if you aren't doing the fixed price. 

Ice cream: The oatmeal cookie one is to die for! 

Free dessert: butterscotch pudding in shotglasses is soo yummy. If you don't want to order a dessert, but want something tiny.. this will come free if you wait patiently !

I can't wait to go back to the bar and try BK's recommended burger. Next visit!"
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"I've been to nearly all of the highly rated steak places in Vegas, and this one was decidedly mediocre. It wasn't even as good as the less-highly-regarded Botero at the Encore, so that alone was disappointing. 

We came here for my little sister's 21st. She started the evening off by ordering a margarita. Odd at a steak place (umm you drink martinis and red wine!), but she's 21, so whatever. It was AWFUL. Undrinkable. Her 21 year old buddy got one as well and both of them couldn't choke them down. I figured the $15 margarita couldn't be THAT bad, so i tried some. Yup, decidedly awful. Ok, so we aren't getting off to a great start...

We got beef carpaccio and foie gras to start. Beef carpaccio was boring, but it tasted decent enough. The foie gras on the other hand was disappointing. Probably ranks close to the bottom of all the foie I've had in Vegas. While it wasn't badly prepared, it was just missing something.

My husband and I made the mistake of splitting the filet mignon and adding lobster. The $49 lobster add on was awful. The chewiest, most flavorless awful lobster I've had in a LONG time. EW. The filet was decent. I liked the crust, but the steak definitely was nothing special. My dad finished maybe 1/3rd of his ribeye before giving up and calling it too blah to eat. Yes, we're brats about steak, but when you are paying $60 per steak you expect it to be mind blowing. I've eaten 5 better steaks in the past month! Sad. 

The $18 funnel cake for dessert was fun. It was lots of small funnel cakes randomly stuck in what looked like a mini metal forest sculpture thing. They were tasty. My sister ordered a piece of red velvet cake for her birthday. This was NOT tasty. It was dry and flavorless. How freaking hard is Red Velvet cake ???

Service was decent and the atmosphere was nice. Not a bad evening, but not a spectacular one either. At these prices I guess I just expect more these days! Next time I would choose Cut, Botero, Carnevino, or Strip Steak instead to name a few... The dining at the Wynn seems to be going downhill. No more Daniel, no more Alex, and we are left with mediocre steak and vegan food."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"As one of the ONLY semi-reasonable places to eat and drink in City Center, that alone should put it on your must-do list if you're staying there! Overall an awesome place to get your drink on with only a few nitpicky complaints from me !

Service/Atmosphere: Awesome! We sat at the bar and were well taken care of all afternoon. My gripe here is there aren't enough TVs and they are too small. Unless you get a great seat expect to be squinting at the TV. The placement is also odd. The bar has TV's on the ends but none in the middle? Annoying if you're stuck in the middle seats. This was a fun place to watch World Cup - but only because we got good seats. 

Drinks: Prices were bad, as expected. Not like gouge you bad, but typical Vegas strip prices. $8-$10 average for a pint (at least they had fancy ass beers!), $10 for a glass of wine, $11 for a mixed drink. The free beer if you can chug it in 4 seconds game was a cool addition but didn't see anyone trying it ! 

Food: Some real gems! A raw bar and carvery and tons of fun sounding British pub type food ! SWEET! We tried 2 meats from the ""carvery"": Brisket and Duck. 1 # of each was $30ish/meat. Hardly cheap, but I'd say count on 1/2 # pp .. $15 each for a good meal isn't terrible. You get to pick 2 sauces per meat and 1 bread per meat. The standout sauce is the black truffle mayo.. OMG it's wonderful on ANYTHING. You've made a mistake if you don't choose it ! So the brisket was just OK, definitely not best BBQ in vegas material or anything. The duck was FANTASTIC. Only pet peeve here was they just shoved 1/2 a duck on our plate. So much for their ""carvery"". If I'm paying you $30 for half a duck can you cut it up for me damnit?! Other than having to carve our own duck at the bar, I absolutely adored that dish. Would get it again and again. Does duck go with black truffle mayo? Oh hell YES it does! This is the food stuff of low carb dreams :)

Overall cool atmosphere, decent set up for watching games, fair drink prices and fab food menu. Service was great. Look forward to trying more goodies from the food menu in the future ! Every order I saw pass us by looked amazing."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"First impression - the atmosphere here is really great. For a ""tavern"" it had a clean contemporary feel and I really loved the plethora of TV's ! I liked all of the different seating options - couches, bar stools, booths, etc. 

We came to watch Thursday night football and try some sliders. Apparently there might have been a happy hour, but this was neither advertised nor disclosed to us despite our arrival prior to 7 PM. Service was a bit akward, but adequate. 

I liked the many, many slider options. It would be badass if they would let you do a make your own slider platter (where you could vary the type of slider!), but I understand selling them in sets of 3 of one kind is easier for the kitchen and makes more sense. 

After much debate the husband and I settled on the meatball sliders and the BBQ chicken sliders. Both unfortunately were served luke warm - a MAJOR turn off for me. I like everything (coffee, tea, food, etc, ect) served HOT. Like I might burn my tongue hot, but these were just warm and quickly became cold. Whatever, this is something I can get over if the food is spectacular. 

I think the problem here is , I was putting each of these items up against a local gold standard of the same type. Neither could stand up, so this was a disappointment. 

I was comparing the meatball slider to the ones at Metro. The ones at Metro are served on garlic knots and are in-freaking-credible! The ones here were served on hawaiian bread, a nice touch, but just lacked that certain something. 

I was comparing the BBQ chicken slider to the pulled porkie from the slider truck. While chicken will never match the magic of pork, this thing just lacked cohesiveness overall. The pulled porkie from the truck is like a bite of heaven - this was just meh. The chicken was chunks of grilled chicken - I think in the future either a small piece of chicken breast, or pulled chicken would be far better. The chunks slide around funny and are impossible to keep on the bun! 

Overall not somewhere I'll be rushing back to. The atmosphere was cool, but unless you live in the Southwest part of town I don't think the sliders are worth the drive."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"I was skeptical this place would live up to the hype, but OMG did it ever! The 30 minute drive from my house, the 40 minute wait, all freaking worth it. This will never be a regular spot for me (5000 calories for bfast isn't a habit I need to get into!), but for a special breakfast this is the best place I've been off the strip in Vegas (sorry, Bouchon is still my overall fav!). 

They get major props for letting you pay a minimal charge to upgrade to the ""specialty' pancakes when ordering any of the egg dishes. Honestly the smaller (2?) portion of these sweet things is perfect and it's nice to have an egg dish AND a dessert to go with it ! 

I had the breakfast burrito (special from the chalk board) and red velvet pancakes. The breakfast burrito wasn't much of a burrito (well not in a stupidly huge Chipotle sense), but more of a large taco. This was absolutely perfect for me - huge burritos are a turn off and I don't like the ingredient ratio you get with this burrito the size of your face. Burrito (bacon, eggs, cheese, potatoes) was perfect, but the red velvet pancakes did steal the show! Some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Ridiculously fluffy, perfect red velvet flavor - you must try these !

My husband has a certain fondness for chicken fried steak and sausage gravy. He's tried it everywhere here in town from Tiffany's to all the casino diners. He's always bummed that it's not nearly as good as what he's used to from TX. This place was by far the best we've had in Vegas and might be better than any in TX as well. The steak was tender (not chewy and gross), the batter was nice, and OMG the gravy was perfect. It seemed to not be frozen, or they buy an incredibly high quality frozen product - either way, they fooled me. Tasted homemade! He had the smores pancakes that were tasty, but not nearly as good as the Red Velvet!!

I never thought I'd find a local place with BETTER pancakes than my favorite (Oreo Banana Pancakes at Bongo Room in Chicago, btw), but honestly they were! I'd put this breakfast spot up against any diner, anywhere. I'd love to see them add some coffee drinks to the menu (oh and expand to Henderson!)."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"I knew we'd found the secret best deal spot in town when I walked in and the average age in the dining room was 70 or so. The social security set knows where to get the best food deals in town, and in this case they picked a place with damn tasty food as well. 

As far as the more ""moderately priced"" steak type places in town go, take a date to Twin Creeks. If on the other hand you're an old married couple just looking for good meat - this is your spot ! 

Tuesday night is incredible. All entrees are buy one get one free! This makes their normally reasonably priced steak dinners ($25ish for a filet mignon + 2 sides) INSANELY priced. $12.50 for a filet mignon and 2 sides? WHAT?

Let it be known that I'm a steak snob. I've tried to do the $9.99 steak dinner casino rap and ended up throwing it away too many times. I can't do chewy cheap steak. I don't even eat Prime Rib as I find it beneath me. Yup, I said it, I'm the world's biggest steak snob. I went in to this place with pretty low expectations, I mean how the hell can you serve a sizeable filet for $12.50 with sides? The steak here blew me out of the water! SO TENDER, so perfectly cooked, so quality. It was crazy. Honestly it was just a couple ticks below a filet at Hanks. I asked for double green beans to avoid the carby potatoes and they were happy to oblige. The husband got a HUGE ribeye and also liked it, but it wasn't as money as my filet. It was really really good for a cheap ribeye, but it wasn't anywhere close to a Hank's ribeye if you catch my drift. The filet is where it's at!

The dining room is comfortable (it's like a lodge inside) and service was really awesome. Wine was fairly priced (we had a fabulous bottle for just $24 that retails for $16! Very low markup for Vegas). They also have very creative specials (think duck, inventive salmon dishes, etc - they post them on their website ahead of time). Unfortunately I've only had this $12.50 Filet mignon dinner once so I'm scared it was a fluke but I really hope it's not . Sometimes in life you don't get what you pay for - you get so much more ! A bottle of wine and 2 steak dinners with sides and bread for $50ish? Crazy I tell you."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"I'm writing this from the perspective of someone who is currently avoiding sugar and has always hated spicy food. One might say avoid eating Thai, but I'm not a person is easily dissuaded! 

Ordering was difficult (due to me and my funky restriction) :) It went something like this :
----------------------
Me: ""I'm trying to avoid sugar - what do you suggest""

Waitress: ""Are you like allergic to sugar, because we have nothing that doesn't have sugar""

Me:""No, not allergic, just trying to avoid it... What about the duck""

Waitress: ""Duck prices have gone up, don't have any""

Me: ""the beef salad with no dressing?""

Waitress: ""Sure, how hot?""

Me: ""MILD""

---------------

I was then brought the hottest food I've ever eaten. Rather than being a total brat and sending it back, I attempted to get it down. I've never been so ""hot"" in my life! I felt nauseaus, the room was spinning, I downed 5  twenty ounce glasses of water. I don't get how you spice lovers do it :) . It was truely painful to eat ! 

So I know this was not ""mild"" because my coworker got the tri color curry also ""mild"" and it was perfect. A nice subtle heat that builds as you eat the dish. Not something that knocks you on your a** on the first bite. I realize heat levels are hard to ""regulate"", but it's one of my major pet peeves when a place can't show some consistency. When both dishes are ""mild"" and one is 10x hotter than the other there's an issue!!

On a side note, the tri color curry was fabulous and addictive and I completely understand the love it gets! One of the best currys I've ever eaten, although I'm hardly an expert in curry. 

After lunch my coworker and I were both feeling pretty lousy all afternoon. Not stomach lousy but I want to pass out lousy. Had trouble staying awake, killer headache, etc. After eating freaking lettuce + a few ounces of sliced beef and 2 bites of curry I shouldn't feel like crap! I suspect too much MSG, but I know I'm pretty sensitive to MSG so others may not be affected. 

Overall it was cute, homey, and the tri color curry was damn good. It will probably be awhile before I return - the MSG and the raging heat level on my ""mild"" salad have scared me off ."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"Cliffsnotes version: Food was nothing short of spectacular, but service and atmosphere were a little ""douchey"" for my taste. 

I realize the restaurant had only been open a few weeks when we went in January, but honestly cocky slow service is never appreciated. The attitude on our server was such a turn off, especially in a new restaurant, but luckily the food made up for it!

Bacon baguette : This was the only bread offered to us, but mb vegetarians can make a special request. Best.bread.EVER. Somehow there was 0 bacon texture, but maximum bacon taste. You could see tiny flecks of bacon, but you didn't ""feel"" them in your mouth. Very interesting! The artisan salt and butter provided with the bread only enhanced it's awesomeness. 

Appetizers: We tried the shrimp, sweetbreads,beef tartare, foie gras yellowtail, and escargot. Shrimp was good, yellowtail good, but honestly the yellowtail sashimi I had at En over in Henderson recently was better. Beef tartare good, but Michael Mina's is better (I sound like a total snob, I know!). The foie gras custard was disgusting. No one at my table of foie gras lovers could handle it. Think creme brulee meets foie gras and try to decide if that works in your head. Doesn't work in mine! The sweetbreads on the other hand were the best I've had in my life. If you don't like sweetbreads, by all means give these a chance! Perfectly charred, awesome flavor..a must try. Escargot with the homemade ravioli was our 2nd favorite. 

Mains: Tried the pork, the wagyu tenderloin and the veal cheeks. All were nothing short of perfect. The pork was so tender and served with a delish pork filled canneloni. Wagyu tenderloin is on my top 10 steaks I've eaten in my life list! Perfectly seasoned and prepared. The veal cheeks were a nice surprise. If you've ever tried beef shortrib but thought ""I wish this was fattier and softer!"", try the veal cheeks by all means !

Dessert: Tried the chocolate something or other with warm banana bread. Great but not 'special'. The warm sipping chocolate served after dessert was a great surprise. 

Overall, definitely worth a try! If you can get past the trendy douche atmosphere the food is really worth it."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"I wasn't hating this as much as the other reviewers, but I'm being relatively lenient with a few issues we had due to it being so new!

Decor: I thought the walls and ceiling changing every 20 minutes was fun. Kind of silly, but it was a novelty. 

Food:
French Crab cocktail: just crab meat that had been shelled and served chilled with some sauces on the side. Fresh, sweet, succulent, delicious. 

Lobster salad: really tasty and it wasn't just some goopy mayo mess like some others I've seen. Lots of lobster, some avocado.. a nice light dressing. Delish. 

Bread: cold... similar to the bread they serve at bouchon, but not as good!

Risoto: It appears another reviewer didn't love this as much as I did. It was parmesan/champagne flavored and delish! 

Steaks: Awesome, but we had several prepartion issues. The people who ordered their's medium had awesome perfectly cooked steaks. The people (3) who ordered them medium rare all got medium well steaks. 2 of the 3 ate their's as is, but when the 3rd diner asked for a different steak he got some attitude from the waitress. I'm sorry when the steak ordered medium rare is significantly more done than the steaks ordered medium, there was a goof somewhere... they should have replaced it no questions asked. The steak was a dull grey-brown in the middle.. not  a hint of pink.. hardly what I'd call medium rare!

2 diners ordered their steaks rossini style with foie gras.. tasty of course.. but as you can tell from my reviews, I'm a foie gras freak so unless they overcooked it or ruined it, I'm loving anything with foie gras. 

We ordered sweet potato fries, but the waitress forgot to bring them. She belittled my 18 yo sister and told her ""oh you forgot to order them""... umm no, the entire table heard her order them, nice try though. Oh well, so we didn't get to try these. 

I do think this place has some potential. Cool atmosphere, yummy steaks (when they prep them correctly), and some good seafood starters. Service really needs to clean up their act though. If this was a restaurant that had been open for more than 2 weeks I would have definitely give them 2 stars... a steak restaurant shouldn't screw up cooking steaks!"
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"Restaurant week provided the perfect excuse to cross this place off my list. Although we enjoyed it, I think it lacks the ""wow"" factor. If you're jonesing for his famous lobster pot pie (which is fabulous, btw) I actually recommend Nob Hill instead. The atmosphere there is better, and I think the offerings there are more interesting. We found the atmosphere at MM to be very blah. Not cozy blah, or sleek blah, just BLAH. 

First things first: The Bellagio cocktail is awesome and I'm happy about that $14 we spent on it. The $20 wine pairing with the restaurant week menu was just ok. I definitely wouldn't spend $10 a glass on either of the 2 wines I was served if I had the decision to do over again .

Course 1: Tuna tartare. This was a typical MM presentation (similar to how he does his kobe tartare). Egg on top, lots of cool seasonings and things on the plate and then mixed in front of you. This didn't disappoint! Tuna was fresh and the pine nuts and mint and whatnot melded perfectly .

Course 2: I had the Miso Cod, my fiance had the ""3 little birds"". The miso cod was extremely bland and flavorless. The miso flavor was way too delicate for me. The table next to me actually complained about the same thing.. maybe it was an off night? This dish was a huge disappointment given it's one of his ""signature"" offerings. Allegedly it used to be sea bass (rather than cod) and it tasted better back in the day.. who knows. The operative word with 3 little birds is LITTLE. There was maybe 5 oz of meat on the plate. 5 oz is a lot of foie gras.. or kobe.. but not freaking chicken/duck/quail for $39. It was however, beautiful and very tasty. No major complaints.. definitely a recommended dish if you like birds and you aren't a big eater. 

Dessert: This took 35 minutes to arrive.. yes, we sat for 35 minutes between main course and dessert. Damn annoying if you ask me. The dessert, however, was excellent! We had the rootbeer float with homemade rootbeer sorbet (rootbeer sorbet covered in rootbeer..kinda stupid but awesome at the same time) and then these awesome warm cookies were on the side. Loved it. 

Overall a good dining experience, but with so many great experiences to be had in this city I don't think we'll return anytime soon."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"My experience here was different than the norm. We were dining as part of the comped meal program that Tania mentions in her review. Since it seems this comped meal thing is a normal fixture at Rare 120, figure I'd spell out how it works and whatnot so others don't feel they got ""scammed"" because they didn't understand the rules. 

Regarding the decor - agree with Genevieve M. that the decor is ""heinous"". The music was way too loud - kinda like being in a club. Do NOT make the mistake of doing a business dinner here - you can barely hear yourself think! 

If you have a promoter offer you a comped dinner.. this will take place in the lounge. The lounge is ""cute"" and pretty comfy, so no problems here. Our group of 20 girls showed up around 8:45 PM and didn't have to wait on a Friday night. Dinner started out on a great note. A delicious salad and yummy pretzel rolls. THEN the steak comes. There were 15 of us at my table and they served us about 24 oz of meat.. split amongst 3 plates. Each plate had 1 cup of rice on it. So yeah... 24 oz of meat + 3 cups of rice for 15 people. Maybe models can get full on these portions, but normal people cannot! I was glad that being the fatty that I am, I had planned ahead and eaten some tapas earlier in the evening fully expecting the food at Rare 120 to suck. The steak was actually *good* for a free steak. Good flavor, well prepared.. but my 1.5 oz portion was kind of ridiculous. Really loved that 1/8 cup of rice too.. HA

Things got annoying at the end, too. We had all tipped $10/head before dinner to take care of the staff. We got the drink bill and it had another 20% tacked on there. Apparently the $200 tip we had already left wasn't enough.. ugh. so had to shell out more money for our crappy drinks. On a side note, I asked for ""vodka soda with lime"" and was brought vodka soda with lemon. I realize I'm being nit-picky but for $10, I expected my miniature drink to be made correctly. 

Thanks Rare 120 for the free ""dinner"", but I'd call it more of a snack honestly! I feel like it was fair value for $25 (what I ended up paying for my vodka soda + tips), but I'd NEVER pay full price to dine her. It's ugly, service wasn't great, and the food was nothing to write home about. I just hope they don't skimp on the portions that badly for people paying to eat here!"
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"So keep in mind, as my husband says ""we're spoiled"". No we don't eat at Michelin star restaurants every night, but since living here we've had so much damn good food! My standards for a 5 star dining place are really high - I expect the best when I'm shelling out big bucks! 

We were drawn to Aureole by a $50 GC from restaurant.com and an $85 valentines day weekend 5 course menu. The menu *sounded* good and we'd never tried Aureole so figured it was a great time to give it a go. 

I think I read the word ""Corporate"" in someone else's review in describing the atmosphere. It was pretty, but it felt like a nice hotel in Sweden or something to me. It was cold, austere, modern, but not in a ""cool"" sense. Just kinda blah.

The wine angel and wine tablet were freaking cool. I was however disappointed by their insane prices (only 3 red wines in the entire book under $50 that I could find!) and every wine I wanted to drink (favorites from Napa/Italy) weren't in there. So much for their huge wine list. We did try a $60 or so bottle from Italy and were happy, however.

Anyways, if you're still with me.. here's the food!

*Caviar/Smoked Salmon: So incredibly blah and boring. I love smoked salmon but this fell flat. I had a better smoked salmon appetizer at a wedding I was at recently - sad.

*Short Rib Ravioli with Foie Gras - This was divine and saved the meal from being one of the most boring meals I've had in a long time.

*Dover Sole - bland and tasteless. I took 2 bites and quit eating it. 

*Beef Wellington - I do love me some Beef Wellington but this was one of the worst I've had. Not particularly flavorful and didn't compare to Chef's Palette in Henderson. 

*Dessert - lots of sorbet, some raspberry parfait thing, some icky coffee flavored ""tart"". Nothing to write home about. 

Overall I was pretty disappointed by this pricey dinner. None of the food was awful, but it was so freaking boring and bland I felt like I was eating cruise line food or catered food. There weren't those special touches you get at Alex (amuse bouche platter, special desserts,etc) and for $40 more per person I wish I had spent my money there instead! 

For the record I also was pretty disappointed by Charlie Palmer Steak in the Four Seasons. Maybe his NYC outposts are good, but his Vegas restaurants could really use some work!"
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"This review is for the INCREDIBLE $20.11 Monday - Friday Lunch Special ! I have had the pleasure of eating this twice now, and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. In a nutshell, during the week for lunch, their only offering is an incredibly priced $20.11 three course lunch menu. There are several options for each course, although many of the premium appetizers do come with a $10 surcharge. 

The atmosphere: AMAZING. Beautiful terrace over the strip that reminds me of one my favorite restaurants in Athens ! The indoor space is light, bright, and beautiful. 

Service: Well the first time we had the most creepy, rude waiter I've had in a long time. Creepy in that he would hover behind you and breathe loudly without saying anything. Rude in that when I asked how the chef recommended the lamb chops be prepared, he answered with ""Huh? He prepares them how you ask him to"" and gave me a weird look. He also freaked out a bit when I told him we were on our lunch break and asked if we could eat quickly. Our server on my second visit was fine. 

Appetizers: On my first visit I had the mezze plate. It was perfectly portioned, and a great way to try a few different things. Everything was super delicious! On my next visit I tried the octopus ($10 surcharge). It was delicious, but it was served luke-warm. I guess they didn't want to overcook it? Who knows. Either way, it was a great portion and the texture was spot-on. 

Entree: First visit I had the lamb chop. This was a little bit of a disappointment because it was one TINY lamb chop (2 ounces). That being said, it's a discount menu and clearly I'm a fat idiot for complaining about one of my THREE courses being too small. It was very delicious and well prepared, just small. My friend got the bass and it was AMAZING. Next visit, tried the shrimp. They implied it was covered in cheese, but it definitely was not. The shrimp are fine, just boring and with very little cheese. I don't recommend ordering them. 

Dessert: The greek yogurt was the best yogurt I've ever eaten. YUM. I've had it twice now. I wish the portion were bigger (it's about 5 bites), but otherwise it's perfect!!!!

If you're on the strip at lunch time, this is one of the best deals you'll find. Stop paying for over priced food court fare and upgrade to a fine dining experience for just a few dollars more !"
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"A Vietnamese place without Pho and Bahn Mi? WTF do they serve? Good stuff I tell you, good stuff ! I'm embarrassed to admit in one week I dined here twice - once with Yelp's Misti and Keith and once with a coworker. Yup I'm a little addicted. 

Atmosphere: Cute and homey. If you eat early (think 11:30 AM for lunch, you'll have the entire restaurant to yourself).

Staff: The woman running the front of house is a doll and very informative. The chef came out to meet us last time too and was also very friendly and happy to answer any questions about the cuisine. Very sweet personable people who care about their restaurant.

Drinks: First I tried the salty lemonade. It was a little sweet for my taste. The next time I tried Pennywort juice. It's like wheatgrass juice but tastier! Definitely recommend trying it if the green color isn't off putting to you !

Food: 

*You must start with the grilled pork spring rolls. These are absolutely the best in the city. The ingredients are so fresh and they are served with an amazing peanut sauce that's made from scratch. Homemade peanut sauce is SO much tastier than the junk that comes in jars. 

*At this point I've worked my way through most the meats. Personal favorites are the BBQ pork (think small slices, no chewy meat, perfectly flavored) and the Chinese sausage. I know you're thinking (wtf, chinese sausage at a vietnamese place?). The thing is, the owners love chinese sausage and wanted to put it on the menu for fun. My coworker is a chinese sausage expert and was extremely pleased with their rendition. YUM

*Oh lastly, you must get this on broken rice ! Yup, it's just cheap broken leftover pieces that are damaged in transit. We had a talk with the chef about this - somehow this rice is like crack. It's better than ""normal"" rice. The tiny pieces somehow taste better and are ""creamier"" in the chef's own words. Some pieces get a little burnt and crispy (yum in my book), but overall the flavor is unique and unlike any rice I've ever had. 

One more thing -  I told the house manager I'd love to see a gluttonous combination of BBQ pork and Chinese sausage on my next visit as one of the combo plates. She did say she's happy to accommodate and you mix and match the meats as you please.  If you don't see the right combo on the menu - ask her, they are happy to create the combo plate of your dreams !"
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"I am kind of a freak about restaurant week! I get more excited about restaurant week than I do my birthday - trying out fancy restaurants is a little obsession of mine. I check the menus weeks in advance, carefully plot out my week, and get so excited for trying new places. Andre's was one of the few total let downs I've had during restaurant week, unfortunately. 

The menu printed online for weeks before had duck as an entree choice. My husband, a friend, and I, all being duck freaks choose Andre's based on this. Unfortunately we got there and they had changed it to f-ing chicken. Honestly I don't get the whole chicken in fine dining thing. Chicken is for KFC, El Pollo Loco, or to be grilled on a salad. You can't get more boring than chicken. Chicken is my protein of last resort and not to be eaten at fancy restaurants. BOO. 

Already things are off on a bad foot, and then we get an awful waitress to boot. She's in her 50s and clearly very full of herself. When we ask for the restaurant week menu, she sighs and tries to talk us out of it! I thought this was for charity, lady. Then we ask about the restaurant week wine pairing and again says we shouldn't do that because it's only small glasses. Thanks, but no thanks. 

I had the scallop (which was tiny, but FAB, sadly the highlight of the meal), steak, and souffle. We added a foie gras. The foie gras was good, but like I always say, I nearly always like foie gras. It wasn't particularly memorable in this case. My steak was just steak. Nothing special there. Then it's time for dessert and it takes 45 minutes. After 30 minutes I complained to a bus boy (as out b*tch waitress was no where to be found) and finally 15 minutes later we get them. I mean I know souffles are fired to order, but damnit we orered these at the same time as our meal, figure it the f out. Our 3 course meal ended up taking over 3 hours. Not cool when it's a Tuesday night and my friend and I both wake up before 4 AM for work. There's leisurely dining then there's obnoxiously bad service. I've never spent well over $200 on dinner before and treated like complete crap. Oh and to add insult to injury the place was nearly empty as well. Ouch. I did send an email to the manager and got no response. I'm disappointed the downtown location is no longer in operation - I would have liked to try it. This location on the other hand is somewhere I will not be returning to."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"I went here today to celebrate Chinese New Year. I was with a group of Chinese folks so perhaps we got special treatment because the service wasn't bad at all. I find most asian restaurants have sub-par service, and this place just seemed average from a service standpoint to me. 

The food on the other hand was above average for a Chinese place. We ordered a smorgasboard of everything and most things I tried were light and fresh tasting rather than greasy. Additionally I didn't get sick from an MSG overload, so that's a great sign. 

I wish I knew the names of what we ordered, but I will admit some of the things were a bit too authentic for this adventurous eater. 

*Bright yellow chicken with the chicken's head on the plate. Hrm, I really didn't like my food staring at me while eating it. Hard to get used to that. I suppose putting a chicken head on the platter makes this place more legit, however. 

*Big blocks of tofu with ""bamboo fungus"" (I kid you not, this is how our Chinese hosts described this!). Looked and smelled pretty nasty, can't say I was even willing to try it as a tofu hater. 

*Beef chow fun noodles - awesome and way better than the ones at your standard chinese delivery place. 

*Fried pork chops - it's fried pork! Obviously amazing. Not as salty as the
ones at Anna's Garden.

*Seabass in a clay pot with tofu - the seabass was slimy and chewy, pretty nasty imo, but most of the people at our table were loving it.

*Honey walnut shrimp - one of my fave dishes and their's is well executed. 

*Fried squid (I'd call it calamari but not sure if the Chinese would use that word?). Phenomenal - not greasy, so light, and so tasty.

*Green beans - ok this sounds lame, but they do some amazing wok fry technique and use shrimp flakes or something and I can honestly say they were the tastiest green beans I've ever eaten. Green beans are my favorite veggie so I do eat them quite a bit. These were so freaking good I'm on a mission to replicate them somehow (as someone who has never cooked Asian food odds aren't in my favor!). 

Overall one of your better Chinese options in Chinatown. Service was decent, the food wasn't all that greasy or MSG-laden, and prices were fair for what you get. I particularly enjoyed the trippy Chinese karaoke videos they play while you eat. My favorite is the one with people in 80's clothes playing paddy-cake over a dead bird. I wish I could speak the language so I could understand what the hell was going on in that video!

*"
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"So I've been here a half dozen times in the past 6 months for birthdays and business dinners. For those that know how & what to order this is honestly the best Japanese in Las Vegas. When I read the low star reviews it's obvious the ordering went awry, so I'm going to use this review as a class in what to get at Nobu 101:

First My DONT'S:
*Do NOT come here with a low budget in mind . You will pay over $100 pp  if you want a satisfying amazing meal. I've come in here and tried to do it ""cheap"" and walked away angry and disappointed. Wait to dine here until you have the budget to do so properly. 
*Do not order off the main menu . It's boring. The food isn't that great. Steak is blah. Tempura is blah. Seriously avoid avoid avoid.
*Don't order sushi rolls.. this should go without saying!!! 
*Don't blindly get the chef's omakase. You'll likely end up disappointed.
*Don't order the shit you get at your normal sushi place and compare it. Order EXOTIC cool things you can't get at home.

Now for what to do!:
*Peruse the ""special"" menu and also talk to the waiter about other goodies they might have hiding in the back. Literally all my great meals here have been 100% OFF the main menu. The off the menu items are by far the best
*Be open minded and try the interesting off the wall stuff. It will really blow you away. I've found the waiters to be really down to earth and cool here.. use them as a resource. Tell them what you like/don't like and ask for recommendations ! 

Lastly, I'll leave you with my favorites. Most are off the menu. Most are seasonal. Yes, it's a grab bag what they'll have when you decide to dine here but honestly I've never been disappointed when ordering this way ! 

Cold:
*Barracuda. OMG. Best sashimi I've had in my life. Who knew!
*Tazmanian Ocean Trout. My next favorite. Basically like a mild buttery salmon. 
*Japanese snapper with pineapples
*Kampachi. I do prefer this prepared the yellow tail jalapeño way instead of the yellow tail. Once you've had wild yellow tail it's hard to order the normal one ever again ! 

Hot:
*Black miso cod lettuce wraps... WITH FOIE GRAS. Insanely good.
*The huge fried fish in that amazing buttery sauce. Definitely not for the dieters or light eaters. Get 1 of these if you have a huge group. It's big and heavy
*Quail stuffed with pork belly (as amazing as it sounds!)

Cliffsnotes: Avoid ordering from the main menu. It's boring, uninspired and won't excite you. Be brave and bold when ordering, don't come with a limited budget. Enjoy!"
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"I'm really torn between 3/4 stars, but I've decided to round up because the food was good. 

First the good:
Robata grill stuff ROCKED! Duck ($3) and Kobe ($6) were both incredible. The portions are small, but so are the prices. 
Monkey Special: this sounds sick, but we loved the tempura banana covered in tuna... the combo really worked. 
Sushi: Sushi rolls were good, but not great. No major complaints or raves here. 

Then the bad:

Gratuitous use of fake KRAB. Plus they call it crab, and it's not crab. I ordered everything without this stuff as I think it's gross. It's like Ka all over again! 

Ok, so the service was well.. awful. The watiress spoke very very poor english, but I can't fault someone for that. We decided to order a custom roll. This is one of my favorite aspects of a ""neighborhood"" sushi joint.. getting the chefs to makeup custom off the menu things. This may be me being a brat.. but this is something I've always been able to do at smaller type sushi joints. 
We ordered a roll with tuna, shrimp tempura, cream cheese, and avocado on soy paper. The roll comes out with just tuna, and shrimp tempura.. on regular paper.. covered in tuna. HRM... ok. So she disappears for 15 minutes and when she comes back she says ""everything ok"".. ""well no actually this roll is pretty wrong.. it was supposed to have cream cheese and avocado"".. she runs away and comes back 10 minutes later with a block of cream cheese and diced avocado.. seriously weird.. like we're going to assemble our own roll over here? 
Next issue... we asked for the lobster roll without tartar sauce. It came with tartar sauce... all..over..it.. who the hell wants tartar sauce on sushi? Seriously that's sick. 

I tried to be super friendly about all the issues, but maybe because of the language barrier.. I think she felt akward. She disappeard for 30 minutes! Getting the check took another 20 minutes after we asked for it. Typically when you know a customer has had a bad experience, you try to do things like printing the check faster than 20 minutes. All in all dinner took 2.5 hours, which is kind of ridiculous given we didn't order that much food. 

Anyways, I know part of my issues were me being a picky b*tch.. ie, making a custom roll and wanting no tartar sauce on my sushi. However, I do think when the custom roll came out wrong, bringing me a block of cream cheese was completely weird and not the right way to handle the issue!

I'll give them another try, but next time I know not to try anything weird... !"
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"So I went for the official opening night through houseseats.. honestly last night's performance was a 2, but given it's new and I was seated at a non-interactive seat I'm trying to give this show the benefit of the doubt! Plus last night there were B list celebs there (Bob Newhart, Don Johnson, etc), so mb that took away from my experience..

First note: don't go unless you get to sit in a ""real"" interactive seat and are eligible for prizes... or mb you just really like seeing these poker celebrties or something.. or you're bored.. I dunno

The basic premise: 2 poker pros are seated at a table on stage along with 6 people chosen from the audience.  The 9th hand is dealt to a card reader so that everyone in the rest of the audience has the same hand and can play along from this LCD from their seats (see note above about only doing this if you get one of these such seats). 

The GOOD: The poker players that are doing this show are ""the real deal"". They are legit, good poker players, and it's neat to see them. They give away gratuitous amounts of prizes to both audience members and the audience members chosen to sit at the table on stage. 


The BAD: Seriously the gratuitious giveaways of tshirts hats, gift cards, etc, takes away from the poker playing. Honestly they stop the playing every 2 minutes for this garbage. They have a 52 card pickup game where audience members randomly pick cards and the person who picks the best hand randomly gets prizes.. it's really dumb. Also, this led to other issues due to the time shortage.. ie when the amateur ended up heads up with the pro (doyle brunson) they both just went all in 8 times in a row with whatever cards they happen to have just to make the game end quicker.. that's not really poker if you ask me. 

Lastly, so the audience members are competing against each other for points you get based on how you play that 9th hand. The top player gets brought up on stage for a dumb headsup match (see above) with a pro. Ok , cool... actually not so cool because at the beginning of the game you pick your favorite color, your favorite suit, and your favorite 3 cards and you get points the whole game whenever those come up. Maybe it sounds ""fun"" to you, but I thought it was so stupid that the guy that got brought up on stage was up there simply because he picked ""red"" ""hearts"" and ""King"" .. give me a break. He even admitted he didn't even know how to play poker. 

Overall this isn't for the serious poker player (other than mb seeing the poker ""celebs""), but could be considered fun if the chance of winning a hat.. or a gift card to the spa gets your juices going."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"If you are looking for a swanky steakhouse experience that won't break the bank, this place might be your best bet in town! 

We dined in the lounge because we wanted to participate in happy hour (6-8 PM, tuesday - saturday!), and the restaurant was fully booked that evening. Service was spotty during happy hour (your waiter is the bartender), but improved substantially after the happy hour people cleared out around 8:30 PM. 

Happy hour includes 1/2 price specialty cocktail (nice mix of martinis and even hot beverages - can you say hot toddy?!) and also includes 1/2 price tapas! We were interested to try the bacon wrapped dates (a steal at $3.50 during HH), but sadly they were already sold out for the evening. They had some interesting offerings (chorizo fondue, etc), and all were under $10 (under $5 during HH) if memory serves. Will definitely have to go back to try those tapas!

We tried 2 specialty cocktails - a blackberry muddled martini and a dragon eye (lychee) drink. Both were REALLY well made, abundant with fresh fruit, and potent. Well balanced and strong is how I like my drinks and they delivered here!

The main draw here is the ""classics"" menu in which you choose a well price entree and get 2 sides and a salad included. Based on our cravings, we ended up with 
*2 lobster tails from the classics menu ($50, one tail was $31, FYI), served with a salad, mac and cheese, and mashed potatoes
*12 oz filet mignon, a la carte ($27) served with creamed corn ($7)

The lobster was actually REALLY good. I hate rubbery gross lobster, but this passed the test. Soft, perfect texture. No weird flavor. YUM. 

The steak on the other hand was just ok. For the price it was outstanding, but haven just eaten at Hanks last week the memory of a nice pricey steak was still too fresh in my mind. I'd get steak here again, but I'd try another cut next time. I'd put the steak way better than Outback, but definitely not in the ""top tier"" steak range (Hanks, Cut, Carnevino, Strip Steak, etc, etc), but for half the price it's an INSANE value!!!

Sides were really awesome. Fabulous mac and cheese and the creamed corn was loaded with bacon - YUM. I hate creamed corn but I couldn't stop eating the bacon loaded version ! Like everything in life - bacon always makes it better! The salad was pretty eh, but then I hate onions and it was onion-y. Bread basket was delish (pretzel bread, parkerhouse!!), but would have been better served warm.

We had 2 glasses of great wine, and the bartender was kind enough to make recommendations for our next visit and even pour us some sample glasses of things he likes! 

Our total with 2 lobsters, 12 oz filet, 2 martinis, 2 wines, 3 sides, 1 salad, was $120! Not a ""cheap"" dinner, but cheap compared to nearly every other nice steak house in town. We will definitely be back - the tapas menu and happy hour martinis are calling my name."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"My husband and I stopped in last week for the $19.99 AYCE tapas promotion. No clue how long this will continue - but if they are offering it and you are staying at the Hard Rock, you really should indulge! 

No happy hour on drinks during the $19.99 promo (or so we were told). The specialty martinis were tasty, but they were $12 and SO TINY. I mean I get that this place serves tiny food, but tiny drinks just aren't cute. Especially for $12. Whatever, minor setback. 

My husband and I came hungry and had grand plans of downing 12 tapas. Unfortunately we only were able to do 9 before we were beyond stuffed !! I recommend coming in groups of 3+ if doing the AYCE so you get more variety. The portions were a tad big for 2 people - with most coming in sets of 3 or 4. You order the tapas 2 at a time (per person) and they keep bringing them till you get to a set you can't finish. 

One of the least appealing-sounding tapas ended up being my favorite. It was steak marinated in jack and coke. I hate jack and coke, but somehow this dish worked. YUM. The best sounding one to me (lobster and steak with vanilla mint butter) was an epic fail. Chewy steak and lobster and the vanilla mint butter was kind of gross. I would say one of the overall biggest disappointments was, they go for some kooky combinations and I'd argue many of them don't work. I like to trust the chef and just see how they can make weird flavor combinations work - but here sometimes the chef disappointed me. 

Another example of a weird combo? The pork belly with chips. I thought somehow the pork belly and chips would be cohesive. Nope, it was pork belly (mediocre pork belly at that) and then like 6 lays off brand potato chips strewn about the plate.. HUH? Made no sense. 

Other things we tried... carne asada tacos - just alright, tuna sashimi - fresh, but nothing exciting, small's balls - risotto balls that were FABULOUS, but huge and filled us up too much. The chicken and waffle fries (with syrup on the waffles fries) was a really cute idea, but the chicken was chewy and not all that great. The pretzel bread and beer cheese dip was tasty, but the dip was inconsistent and not mixed well so some dips were awesome and others were ""off"". 

So you're probably wondering why the 4 stars? I'm a sucker for ""fun"" food. I love whimsical stuff, I love silly stuff, and I love tasting lots of things (so mini portions are right up my alley!). The $19.99 AYCE special was very fun, and the service was great. 

Where they fail is the execution side ! I'm all for ridiculous combinations (vanilla mint butter, or potato chips and pork belly), but damnit don't put things on the menu that don't work! I think this place has a ton of potential, but until they make some menu tweaks the food is really more 2-3 star. I will, however, be back in Jan if they continue to offer this promo to try some more things and see if I just picked some crappy items in the first go round."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"Italian + Steak. What a heavenly combination. From start to finish my business dinner here was pretty fan-freaking-tastic. Impeccable service and some amazing food. Having dined at most of the big name steak places over at Palazzo-Venetian (Cut-Delmonico-Carnevino), I'm going to try to offer some tips to help you select your next insanely expensive steak dinner !

Pork back fat. Yup, that was the waiter's description when he set down a creamy paste called ""lardo"" and I said ""excuse me?!"" As disgusting as a paste called lardo described as ""pork back fat"" sounds.. wow it's fabulous. I felt guilty eating more than like a teaspoon of it, but that's ok. Only issue here was the ciabatta served with the back fat was only barely warmed over. 

Wine list. What a treasure trove of Italian wines they have. For those not on a budget this wine list is killer. Their beer list is also ridiculously good might I add, but most beers were $15+! There were only 5 wines south of $100 and the markup is among the worst I've seen in Las Vegas. Our $110 wine we drank retails for $17 . Over 500% markup?! Sick for even Las Vegas if you ask me. 

For an appetizer we only tried the beef carpaccio. Amazing and among the best I've had in my life. We got 2 orders for 7 of us and we were fighting for the last scraps. Highly recommended ! 

Before I get into the steak, I want to pay hommage to the mashed potatoes with a poached egg mixed in. Some of the best mashed potatoes I've had in my life. That good ! Now onto the..

STEAK: I personally tried half of the ""ribeye for 2"". At $130 it's insanely expensive. Add $15 if you want them to pour some aceto balsalmico on it (ridiculous surcharge). The presentation was beautiful and the steak was among the best in Vegas. One of my dining companions is a steak freak and declared the steak here the best of his life. The seasoning, char, and preparation were all perfect.  As a comparison to other places -
*Delmonico's ribeye isn't as tasty, but a WAY better value. You get nearly the same amount of meat on a ""1 person"" steak at Delmonico as you do on a ""2 person"" steak at Carnevino. At Delmonico the steak retails for ~$60. It's freaking $130 here. Yes, Carnevino's is better, but is it $70 better? I would say no for those that have big appetities ! 
*Tasting platter at Cut retails for ~$130. Honestly I'd take this over the steak at Carnevino most days. It's more exciting (having Japanese wagyu, american wagyu, AND prime on it) and I really do think the wagyu beef is worth the premium. 
*So basically comes down to how price sensitive you are, whether you want one steak done really well with a beautiful char, or are you looking to try wagyu. As a wagyu freak I do slightly prefer Cut but I know some people aren't believers in the magic of wagyu! 

Overall a solid steakhouse and the addition of Italian fare to the typical steakhouse meal is fabulous. Service was impeccable . I hope to return many times in the future."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"***500th Review***

Wow, where to start? The evening began with an awesome ride in the famous gold limo and a short tour of the Mansion. A hot chick dressed in a kimono leads you through  the Mansion and into food fantasy land. Sadly food fantasy land is incredibly ugly - done up in shades of pale pink and purple with lace doilies everywhere. We ate here 2 weeks after Easter and there were Easter eggs everywhere. Pink, purple, easter eggs.EW.

Take out the pastel Easter theme and this place is flawless ! We did 2 courses for $135 and I'd really say 1 course for $105 or 2 courses for $135 is the way to go! You do NOT need to order dessert. Trust me. 

I could go on all day about the bread. The 35 choices. The fact that they heat up your bread for you. The butter carved lovingly off of a huge loaf with salt sprinkled on top. For us carboholics, you've just reached nirvana. Be careful, however, there's still food coming!

The amuse bouche is crab and caviar. Delicious and impeccable.

Course 1: It's between here and Alex for the best sea scallops in town. If you're a scallop person, by all means don't miss these. The king crab salad was equally amazing.

Course 2: So I made the mistake of getting the lobster. While it was great, my husband ordered the foie gras wrapped in guinea hen. This was the single best dish I've ever had in my life. It sounded blah, but WOW, life changing dish. Like close your eyes in ecstasy dish! So good in fact that for $40 my Dad and I ordered one to share in addition to our lobster. The only travesty is that dish is too small ! I could eat 3 of those , but then I'm a glutton. 

Dessert: So like I said, don't order one. They bring out this cart of magical delights that's included with your meal, each one more fabulous than the last . FOURTY choices of mini treats. Each one hand painted in metallic colors.. wow.. beautiful, tasty, there really were no duds here. Tahitian vanilla caramels, banana filled chocolates (with actual fresh bananas inside!), white chocolate dipped pineapple... We got 5 or so each, but we should have gotten 10 ! 

So I'm going to leave you with some help if you're trying to decide between this place and Alex (my other favorite place in Vegas). I liked Joel a little bit better because 
*limo
*guinea hen (best dish of my life)
*bread cart
*dessert cart 
However, the rest of the diners in my party preferred Alex. I can definitely agree on an aesthetic standpoint - Alex is just a better dining environment.  I didn't have any of the best dishes of my life at Alex, HOWEVER, Alex overall was more food for the price and every single thing was fantastic. In simple terms, Joel's food ranged from 4 to 5 depending on the dish. At Alex, everything was a 4.5 . 

My husband summed it up this way: Next time we want a nice dinner, call Joel and see if they have the guinea hen/foie. If they do - go to Joel for the $105 menu and just get that, the bread, the amuse, and the dessert cart! Otherwise, Alex all the way. 

PS - posted lots of pics. I'm not a big picture person but this place was so jaw dropping I couldn't resist."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"Lavo is the new nightclub/restaurant located in the Palazzo from the creators of Tao. It opens officially next weekend, but there appeared to be some form of a soft opening this weekend. 

Restaurant: They are trying to be some sort of mediterranean fusion tapas place. All dishes are small and pricey ($7 for a slider, $15ish for a small tapas sized sih), and they don't offer any entree sized portions. We tried the kobe burger, fries, twice baked chicken, and a breaded veal dish. All were good, and the standout was the veal dish. Nothing was spectactular. Drinks were tasty and cost $12 each. Atmosphere seemed trendy, but contrived like everything in vegas! Servers in the main part were dressed like crap in jeans and tennis shoes but perhaps this was for the soft opening? We ate in the lounge part and the cocktail watiresses were hot and well dressed. 

Nightclub: Even though they weren't even open yet officially and obviously weren't packed, they still made us go through the ridiculous fanfare of going through 6 bouncer checkpoints to get into the club. One guy told us ""You're lucky you came now when it's easy to get into... once we start advertising this place is going to get REALLY exclusive!"" Ok, ouch, so I'm that ugly that I'm not going to be able to get in once this place gets ""cool"".. mmmk whatever. Also they made my bf tuck in his button down shirt which I thought was weird. 

Anyways, once we got into the nightclub I really didn't feel that impressed. I think Tryst is way better. Although the dancefloors seem to be similar sized, at Tryst you can dance all over the place.. this place was small and cramped outside the dance floor, so I think once this place fills up more the dance floor will get too full. The rest of the place is all VIP/bar area. The bar area was cramped and you definitely had no room to dance if you were standing anywhere but the dance floor. Seemed like it could get annoying.

Ok another issue I had.. so the theme is bathhouse. Kind of a fun/cool theme. HOWEVER they sucked at the decor. It's all black pretty much. There's a bizarre pseudo-sexual ugly painting in the back. There's towel rack handles on the wall in a weird pattern. At Tao they have all these cool bathtubs everywhere but then they build a place called a freaking bathhouse and have no such decor.. it's really odd. I mean the place was pretty and everything, I just wasn't blown away. Also, there's no outdoor part in the club part. There is a patio in the restaurant (however no service out there!), but once you get into the club there is no stepping outside. 

Last but not least.. the music. Again, Tryst wins out. They played a lot of ""old"" songs, but not fun 70's/80's songs.. songs that were just well old. Like Nelly's ""ride with me"" or Gin and Juice by Snoop. Just lots of songs that are very ""tired"" but not classics if that makes sense. Either play trendy cool music, or play me some Bon Jovi.. none of this cool 10 years ago crap. Tryst had a nice mix of songs of the moment and 80's stuff. This DJ needs help. 

Oh and one last complaint. So the line for this place is OUTSIDE. Yes, it is August and they are going to make you wait outside. We only waited 5 minutes due to the aforementioned emptiness, but if this place ever becomes cool and actually gets a line I would hate waiting outside for an hour + in extreme heat or even the ""extreme"" cold of the Vegas winter. EIther way , waiting outside blows and that was poor planning on their part."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"I'm torn between a 3 and 4 on this review, but I'm rounding down because I expected more, damnit. It's Daniel Boulud (btw, I've eaten at Daniel in NYC, and it's amazing), it has a Michelin star.. it's at the Wynn.. with those sort of credentials I kind of expected a transcendent type of meal. Perfect food, amazing service, etc.

We had reservations at 7:30 but were not seated till 8:00. I can't fault them for that, reservations simply aren't an exact science (sometimes the party in front of you just drags! it happens). While waiting at the bar we were brought our amuse bouche. It was amazing.. lobster in a chilled corn soup with lobster. Honestly a perfect bite and really got me excited to try the food! The drinks we had at the bar were good, but not memorable. Pricey as is usual in Vegas at $12-$15 a drink. 

Service: Pretty disappointed on this aspect. When we asked the waiter if chef could prepare us some warm foie gras, he just said ""no"". Here's a trick for the waiters out there - just say ""I'll ask the kitchen"". I don't care if it's BS.. it just looks way better than denying a customers request ! Otherwise he was dull and unattentive. The sommelier was particularly bad. I told him I was thinking of X, Y, and Z (all of which were well under the $100 mark) and asked him which of those 3 were the best. He then says, I think you should decide between A, B, and C (all of which were ~$180-$250). In fact, he directed me to the 3 most expensive wines on the page. Coincidence? I don't think so. He definitely made me feel 'cheap' for ordering a $90 bottle of wine which was inappropriate. 

Appetizers:
*Flatbread with goat cheese and pancetta. Freaking awesome. The bread was just crisp enough with just the right amount of cheese and toppings. Very impressed. 
*Lobster salad and crab salad - both good, but not insanely memorable or anything. 
*Heirloom tomato salad - the knife skills on these guys are quite impressive! They peeled all the tomatoes and made some cool shapes with the skins. Very pretty and incredibly fresh perfect tomatoes. They couldn't have done it better. 

Entree's:
*Duo of beef - tasty, but I don't get the hype about his shortrib. I've had better shortrib in this city many times (craftsteak comes to mind), but those that got this dish liked it. 
*Veal - tender, beautiful, and perfectly prepared. I recommend this dish pretty strongly if you're a veal fan. 
*Salmon - Sounds pretty boring, but my mom raved about it. She called it the best salmon she's ever had, etc.. mb if you're a salmon person this is a good thing to go with. 

Everything was all going pretty well.. until my Dad and I tried our burgers. Wow, this was SUCH a disappointment. I absolutely love burgers and was so psyched to try this one. It wasn't good at all. The burger at BO or Burger Bar, or well most places in town are SO much better. Why was it so bad??
*The foie gras: I ate half the burger without tasting ANY of it. On the 2nd half I dug through with a fork and came up with literally .01 ounces. I'm talking a SPECK. Frankly for $32 I expected ~1 oz of foie gras. In fact that's what his recipe called for. This was embarassing. If you're serving f-ing foie gras in a burger, put at least enough where someone can find it was a magnifying glass. 
*Shortrib/beef: Just nothing special. The shortrib didn't add anything. Literally I felt like I was eating a boring shortrib meatball. It lacked flavor. Call me a weirdo, but I thought this burger needed some seasoning, or cheese, or something.. it just cried out BLAND.
*Bun.. completely inedible to me due to the disgusting amount of horseradish covering it. Both sides were slathered with thick horseradish sauce. So much in fact I could taste nothing but horseradish. Granted I hate horseradish anyways, but I think unless you're a HUGE fan you'll find that it completely overpowers everything else on the burger. 
*Fries.. AWFUL. Limp, cold, lacking flavor.. Not enough salt, not fried properly. How can a french guy screw up french fries so badly?

*sigh*.. So I'm pretty damn disappointed about my burger last night. I love foie gras, I love french food, I love burgers.. I just went in expecting to really like it! $32 later, I'm pretty pissed. 

For dessert we all shared a chocolate souflee. I don't get how they do it there because you don't need to preorder. You say you want a souflee and it just appears minutes later. Confusing. That being said, it was awesome. It was silky and more like a mousee.. I really liked it. One of the best souflees I've ever had. 

***Cliffsnotes version***: Try this place, but don't get the overrated burger. Dinner for 6 with drinks (wine, cocktails) and tax and tip came out to $100 a head. Kind of reasonable for Vegas. Service is spotty, but the ambience is nice and there are some standouts on the menu."
kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,"I chose Twist for my birthday dinner - having been to most of the other top restaurants in town, I was wanting to try something new and different for my birthday. It was a pleasant evening, but based on the prices and reputation of the chef I'm going to have to grade this place a little harshly. I'm going to draw several comparisons to Joel Robuchon because the price points are similar, although I realize Joel is meant to be more classic French and this food is meant to be more modern. 

Atmosphere: Beautiful! I do think Mix (which is quite similar from a design and view standpoint) is a bit prettier and has better views, but I do think this place was infinitely better than say Joel Robuchon from a design aesthetic. The music they played was very strange and space-age sounding, but I suppose that fits given the type of restaurant. 

Food: 

*Amuse Bouche - After being treated to a beautiful platter of canapes at Alex (so good my husband and I debated about asking for seconds!), and an amazing caviar & crab dish at Joel Robuchon, the amuse bouche here was pretty bad. It ranged from boring to interesting, but nothing tasted all that great. There were some boring bread sticks in olive oil (huh?). a mascarpone cheese ice cream with wasabi and sake (not good), a whiskey and guiness jello shot (huh??). and some boring cheese sandwich thing. Nothing I wanted seconds of!!

*Bread - ok Joel Robuchon spoils you on bread for life I tell you. After being treated to a wheeled cart with 25+ choices there, the sad little plate of 3 breads (french, multigrain, and molasses with raisins) just wasn't cutting it. I can say the bread was served VERY hot and tasted pretty good. 

*Fig/Foie Gras - They unfortunately didn't have any seared or warm foie gras available whatsoever (odd to me in winter! and in a FRENCH RESTAURANT), but whatever. Sadly they have removed the ""foie gras 4 ways"" and replaced it with this. This was just basic cold foie gras terrine. Not all that tasty or special or interesting. I've had many better foie gras terrines in my life. 

*""Las Vegas"" - This to me showcases how weird and random his cuisine truly is! It had 4 components -
* tuna over pears -just creative enough to be special, impeccable tuna
*lamb shoulder - braised and DELISH. One of the more special items we ate last night. Sad it was a tiny portion. 
*guacamole with cactus - yup as boring and weird as it sounds
*Martini glass with sorbet and popcorn - I'm all for fun food, but this was just SILLY. I'm sorry you can't just throw popcorn in a martini glass with boring sorbet and call it gourmet. Nope. 

*Nebraska ribeye 2 ways - this was a pleasant surprise! It was HUGE (there was 12 ounces or so of center cut meat) and the meat was incredible. It was served with cut up burnt gross meat swimming in oil with green beans (HUH? so this is your ""2 ways""??) and some pumpkin thing if memory serves. The sides didn't matter as the main ribeye was very large and very tasty. They could skip the nasty oily grizzle meat on the side if they are trying to seem gourmet. 

*""DEER"" - a little odd to call it deer (it's always been venison in TX!), but mb they call it that because it's unlike venison in any way. It wasn't gamey and it was VERY tender. It was like a ""deer"" filet mignon. It was served with some terrible brussel sprouts and chewy gnocchi. Again, stop serving crappy sides already! At least the meat was really good, so I could look past it. Best ""deer"" I've ever had (and growing up in TX we ate deer quite a bit!!). 

*Dessert - Pierre Gagnier 5 ways (or something like that!) - I'll skip the boring details but this was actually fun, and enjoyable. There were playful desserts and to me dessert is a time to be silly. chocolate, caramel, apple, pistachio, etc, etc lots of flavors and all delicious! 

Wine: Pleasantly surprised with their domestic offerings. Some of my favorite Napa estate cabs were available and pricing wasn't really that bad. The wine service was very good as well. 

Service: The waiters were French and in my opinion could have been a tad friendlier. Because this place is expensive I'm disappointed that the service wasn't better. We spent a LOT on food and wine and I don't feel like we were treated as such. I asked for another multigrain roll and was promised another one... it NEVER CAME. I specifically ordered the ""pre-theater menu"" ($10 less than the regular menu), but I was charged full price. My husband went without water for 30 minutes. Nit picky stuff, but service should have been flawless! 

Overall impressions: I'm glad to have dined here, but I can't say we will likely come back. The food ranged from boring to weird to delicious, but never had that ""this is the best bite of my life"" quality to it. The meats were impeccable and the desserts were fun -those were the highlights for me. Service could be better, but the restaurant is beautiful. I would recommend trying Joel Robuchon first if you're looking for a fancy French dinner."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"Are you down to hydrate your non-alcohol-filled self? Well, you got a choice of hitting up the strip where a drink will cost you $8-$15, or you can go to PT's, or you can hit up this super quaint, but hole-in-the-wall type neighborhood spot. 

I was a bit skeptical coming in here, as there are not many places to sit. You come here with a group of people to take advantage of their drinks, and then maybe enjoy some karaoke while you're at it. 

Cocktails are modestly priced at about $4-$6. They have some great HH deals from 6-9p.m., where all drinks are 50% off, food is $2 off, and karaoke is $5 off/hour. I got to know the bartenders there (Jen and Justin) who are super cool, and I had a great time swapping really random stories, which I can hardly recall. 

Try the soju mixed drinks. It comes in a bottle where they mix half a bottle of soju with a ton of other flavors ranging from mango, strawberry, melon, yogurt, to apple and more. I didn't think it'd taste good, but it was surprisingly easy to go down, and does the job if you wanna let loose. The karaoke is a bit outdated, and they don't have the newest songs on file, but if you just want to sing some classics and some semi-recent songs that are maybe 6 months old, then you're good. 

I had a sampler, and it was really yummy. It came with onion rings, jalapeno poppers, chicken strips, and some other stuff, This is a super local, neighborhood joint, immediately next to Tea Station. I highly doubt I would have ever known about this place unless some local had brought it up. I think my review is super biased based on their HH because it can't be beat. This is my current fave spot in vegas for a true drink fest."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"A fancy looking place with a fancy vibe. It's one of the places that I normally reserve for a special occasion, and so it was. The omakase choice selected was the middle option: 

$80 - aperitif sake / amuse / sashimi (4 kinds) / grill (3 varaieties) / nigiri (8pc)

The $120 seemed to be too much food from the way it sounded, plus, I wanted to have the option of ordering a la carte items that may not make it on the omakase menu of the day. 
Everything was generally good, and my favorite must have been the negitoro handroll that came with the omakase since it used bluefin tuna belly. Other a la carte items ordered was some fancy fishes I had never heard of before (not too notable), anago, and the uni. 

All in all, the meal went by really fast (because we stuffed our face at super speed) and I was a bit sad that the meal was over so quickly. I wasn't too stuffed, so the $120 wouldn't have been a bad idea. 

Surprisingly, the notable dish was one of the grill items. There's three that come together on a plate, and, it was a tuna that was seared. I didn't think I'd appreciate seared tuna (as I prefer it raw), but it was amazing. 

The desert is underwhelming--they outsource it from Suzuya. I'm not a fan of their crepe cake at all, so I chose the green tea roll cake with azuki cream inside. It was good. 

So it comes down to the question. Is this the best sushi I've ever had? No.
Would I come back? I think for the ambiance and experience along with high quality ingredients, it is worth trying once. I've got a couple other places that I'd personally rather go to, so this will be a one hit wonder for me. 

Tip: Make a reservation, and you need not tell them what your choice is until you arrive at the restaurant. Enjoy~!!"
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"Don't underestimate this place based on the exterior. I thought this place was some hole-in-the-wall spot based on how unpresentable it looks. Since we were craving for some AYCE KBbQ and this is one of the highly reviewed places we decided to stop in here at 7:30a.m. Yeah, great thing, it's open 24 hours! 

The AYCE BBQ menu is a bit limited to what I am used to in Los Angeles standards, hence my knock off of one star. Also the price is a bit higher than L.A. for what you get.

The interior was shockingly nice! IT's gorgeous inside with multiple T.V.'s bolted on the walls, marble tables, and brand new vents. Apparently, they had a fire and renovated this entire restaurant entirely a few months ago. It's clean, and brand spanking new! 

Lunch option until 3p.m. - $21.99 for AYCE.  It comes with limited meats such as beef brisket, pork bulgogi, beef bulgogi, and some other things. My main point is, there are NO short ribs or beef tongue in this option. What it DOES come with that most other AYCE places don't have is the Ttuk Pokki (korean rice cake). It was overly sweet, since they added too much sugar so the flavor was off. 

Brisket was legit. Pork spicy marinated bulgogi was on point 5/5. Beef bulgogi was okay. Side dishes were quite good. 

Dinner AYCE is $26.99. And it has marinated short ribs in this menu, but there's some limit to the order I believe. 

If you're craving for AYCE KBBQ at a nice place, this place is definitely a great place to try. The service was stellar here, but I don't know if it's because no one else was really there at 7:30a.m. I mean, who the heck eats that stuff at 7:30a.m. anyway. 

Note: The restaurant has plenty of none AYCE options. It's worth giving a stab at their other regular dishes and soups available. WILL BE BACK!"
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"Do you sometimes just want a simple BBQ bacon cheeseburger drenched in BBQ sauce? You can't get it at in n out because they don't sell it, and you can't head to Bachi, because it wouldn't be the simple 'ole burger you're craving. 

BBQ bacon cheese smash to the rescue!!!!!! I wanted bacon. With cheese. And it had to be BBQ. So I finally came here after looking at multiple burger reviews and their menus. Trust...took me about an hour. 

Not too bad at all. I give them way more kudos than shake shack because 1) I feel like I'm getting what I paid for at $6,50 for the burger. It ain't cheap but it ain't too crazy pricey. Price point is well set for the quality and what they're selling. 2) Shakes are made using Haagen Daz ice cream. Yeah, I don't get paying $5 or more for custard shakes. 

This is the step up from Carl's junior and In n Out, but one step below the upper echelons like Bachi, Umami, and Stout. 

Fries were shoestring but tasted okay. Mine were cold for some odd reason. 
Service here isn't too great. I spilled soda all over my fries (thankfully after I ate a few and decided I didn't care for it) and the table and the floor, and saw 2 kitchen staff walking towards me while I was in their line of view. These guys didn't even flag the host, cashier, or the other workers to clean it up. They didn't offer to bring a mop out either. I jut ended up cleaning the mess myself which was no biggie, but I swirl sucky expected they would notify the other staff after seeing what happened. 

My super quick motor skills kicked in quick enough to save what was left of my burger from drowning in the sea of soda. 

It was the perfect burger for what I wanted during my craving strike. Will be back but skipping the fries and maybe I'll try their shakes or the onion rings."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"Every dish is under 600 calories? Whaaaat?! That is insane. 
The food is healthy, but be mindful as the cashier told me, ""We cook with organic ingredients as much as possible."" So, for those of you who are organic food purists (which I am not), it is something to keep in mind. 

Grass-fed burger- 3.5 star. It's good for grass-fed burger. It's not ""The"" best burger, but delicious for what I hear grass fed meat tends to be less flavorful (?) and dry. We can't win 'em all. 

Sweet potato fries - 2 star. It was soggy, limp, kinda like the super oily, dead fries that you sometimes find at Mc Donald's. These are supposed to be baked, and apparently, they were super crispy when my partner had tried them last. Not when I tried them... :( 

Fish tacos - 5 star. The cashier told me it's the most popular dish, and people come back for it. So, the fatty that I am, ordered this as a ""kids menu"" (one taco only) just to try it on the side. WOW. I've NEVER liked fish tacos. This was the highlight of my night. The crunchy veggies on top add a nice contrast and texture. And, since my side was sweet potato garlic fries which came with a garlic aioli, I dipped my tacos in the sauce, thinking it was originally for the tacos. Well, it turns out the original fish tacos do not come with this sauce. They could maybe add this to their menu, but oh wait, that would tip the caloric intake to probably over 600 calories with their regular menu that comes with 2 of these tacos. I dunno. It was delicious though. And, I wonder if it was the combo of the garlic aioli with the tacos that made it amazing. 

Refillable sparkling water for free? It's such a healthy alliterative to drinking sodas. Love that they have it. 

I will definitely be back for the fish tacos. Can I add garlic aioli on the side?"
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"I headed here for the much anticipated Hainnan chicken rice. The place is in a random location and quaint. The set-up is a bit unique, as you order food first at the cash register, then grab a seat, if available. 

A friend and I ordered the Hainnan chicken rice with a side of egg and Chinese sausage, the sambal chicken wings, and the bao, in addition to the salad. 

Somehow, the two gentlemen who ordered their food after us were getting the exact same order of Hainnan chicken, wings, as well as the salad dish prior to us, which lead to much confusion. 

We got an apology by the waitress, and then received our orders, but couldn't help but notice that the size of our chicken was 3/4 the size of the table next to us, and the wings were smaller as well. The salad portion was also significantly smaller. Side by side, it was a bit obvious. 

The Hainnan chicken itself seemed like high quality chicken. The portion however is small as a trade-off. The side sauces that came with it were okay.  

The sambal wings were an epic fail in flavor, and neither of us enjoyed it, even leaving a wing behind. 

The salad dressing and flavor was really good and refreshing. The bao was nothing to rave about as the fried chicken inside had a mediocre crunch, texture, and flavor was unimpressive. 

All in all, the price was a bit high for everything we got. The service is questionable, as there is one person running around trying to take orders and serve customers. Not only did it seem hectic, but, the waitress seemed a bit overwhelmed and anxious in general. 

Just a note, there is no restroom available, so wash your handsies prior, and your bowels emptied prior to your arrival. 

The question is would I return? I'm not sure as nothing was notable to me, and I have had better Hainnan chicken elsewhere."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"This is the Mecca for those who love food, enjoy cooking, and are experimental in trying different things. I found about this place from several regulars who swore by the quality. I just so happened to be in the neighborhood, so stepped foot in here. 

The girl was super informative, helpful, and gave several recommendations based on what I was trying to achieve. The prices are steep, and while in here, you just might lose sense of the fact that paying $18 for a bottle of high quality olive oils or balsamic vinegar is quite extravagant. After all, when you're mesmerized, it's hard to think straight. 

I wanted a versatile bottle to test out their stuff at home, so got the Tuscan herb infused olive oil and the pomegranate balsamic vinegar based on the recommendation that this is a great combo for marinade as well as for dipping bread. SOLD! 

Anyways, I think it's been 6 days since I bought it, and I already used a quarter of the bottles each. I made a strawberry goat cheese spring mix salad and topped it off with this combo as a dressing. I marinated the chicken for three days, and it was quite delicious. I also toasted some garlic artisan breads and dipped into this stuff and couldn't stop. Oh man...this stuff is good. The balsamic vinegar is nothing like the stuff you buy at TJ or the grocery stores. I woke up from my trance when I was at Smiths later, and the most expensive olive oil was $9. I guess i got some high quality stuff, right? 

They'll let you sample, but be wary. I don't know if it's just me, but as I was stepping out of the store, I wanted to make a beeline for the toilet. It's a great laxative alternative. The only explanation is that my body can't consume too many shots of straight olive oils and balsamic vinegar within 20 minutes. 

Good luck!!!! There's no toilet nearby!! You've been warned."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"I luckily found this place when I googled, ""Things to do in vegas."" Afterall, I'm really sick of doing generic activities in las vegas. Boozing and clubbing gets really old, and definitely not as interesting to do on a bday (at least for me). 
  Since i wanted to do something fun, cool, that I had never done before on my birthday, I opted for playing in a so-called huge sandbox. Originally, I thought I was going to break, demolish and feel like Godzilla by being the mastermind behind the massive machinery. I was soon disappointed for a slight second when I found out I wasn't going to pick things up (was hoping a car...just kidding) and throwing it somewhere a couple feet away and smashing it.  Oh wait, I'm not kidding about the car. 
   Instead, I got to re-arrange tires, pick up a basketball and put it in a tire hole, and get to dig some deep holes. It was challenging and fun at the same time. If the DIG IT people are reading this, maybe the car idea isn't so bad after all. 

  The owner was personable and friendly. The instructors were funny, patient, and an absolute delight to work with. Not only were they informative, but they were real pros that helped me get through the entire activity. I had an AWESOME time. 
  I think the only disadvantage is the price. Luckily, I found a groupon to cut down costs, and it allowed both of us to share the experience together.  I believe it usually costs about $220/pp for 1.5 hours. Not cheap, my friends. 

  Given the choice between the EXCAVATOR and BULLDOZER, STICK WITH THE EXCAVATOR. Cuz you get to play with BALLS. HAHHAHAHAHHA...okay, okay, that too, and it's also much bigger than the bulldozer. Sometimes, size matters, and bigger is better. Even my bf (who did the bulldozer) said he wants to go back and try the excavator. As for me, once you go big, you can't go back..."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"I'm a super fan of authentic Mexican tacos, and some people might consider this place ""Americanized."" I really enjoyed my meal here, and was pleasantly surprised by the presentation, the quality of food, and everything that came along with it including the service and decor. Thank you Groupon for bringing me to this place, because I seriously gave up on finding decent Mexican food in vegas. 

The guacamole was probably one of top 2 best guacs of my life. It was fresh and flavorful. 

I love their chips. It has a great texture, and it's my favorite kind of chip. I don't know if it makes sense, but I hate it when I can smell old oil or taste it in my chips when they haven't changed it in a while. Not here. 

Baja fish (beer battered Mahi Mahi) tacos- 3 star. 
Shrimp tacos - 4 star. 
Carne Asada tacos- 4 star. 
Beef barbacoa- 2 star. 
Guacamole - 5 star.
Corn salad- 4 star.
Refried Beans with Chorizo - 1 star.  BEANS and CHORIZO! Doesn't that sound amazing?  I was sold by the description but it had a lot of chili powder or some spice in it that was overpowering. I couldn't really appreciate the flavor at all. 
Service- 5 star. They were on point most of the time. I did have to ask for some refills on my soda, but, it's all good. 
Ambiance- 5 star. 

I'm a bit confused as to how I'm giving this 5 star after seeing my average up above of each item. I think I was thoroughly impressed with the guac, chips, ambiance, and service. I also loved their flour tortilla (made to order) that they use for the tacos. Presentation of the tacos reminded me of China Poblano (at the Cosmopolitan) so it has this ""fancy"" feel to it without having to pay $4.50 for a taco. 

I think the Groupon deal made this place worthwhile too, considering that we paid almost half of what the dinner was worth. I will definitely be back to try other tacos on the menu next time!"
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"WOW. THAT. WAS. EPIC. 
I'm still in shock from the meal, because 888 has taken AYCE to a whole new level. The whole thing is absolute genius, because it has set the bar really high, rivaling the other non-AYCE restaurants like 8 oz and GOONG. 

Our table got the combo C, which has a variety of premium meats. The highlights of my meal include the Kobe beef, Kobe fatty rib, and Prime Korean kalbi (which are all limited to 1 order per person). Kalbi garlic and kalbi miso were also delicious because the meat quality was amazing. The LA kalbi was fatty and marinated perfectly. 

The owner recommended the kurobuta pork toro, so I had to try that alongside the kurobuta pork belly. Both were excellent when topped with some grilled kimchi and bean sprouts. 

I thought the soon tofu was a bit on the salty side, but the seafood miso soup had a good balance that caters to non-Koreans, meaning that it's not pungent like the way it is traditionally served. We found a crab in there, which is super gourmet cuz that's a first for me.

I was eyeing the dragon roll, but because of the sheer disappointed look and comments from my hubby, I stuck with the simple UNI SSAM, which is uni on top of beef, perilla leaf, and seaweed. I was expecting the AYCE uni quality but was pleasantly surprised that it tasted of a higher quality. 

This is basically a fine dining experience turned into an AYCE style. I committed the AYCE sin by stuffing my face with 3 cream cheese wontons within the first 10 minutes of sitting down (and 3 more later). But I was the last one standing, so, who's got the last laugh now. 

THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS, and as another reviewer said, it is probably the best AYCE in Las Vegas right now, but that's if you get the Combo C that includes the premium meats.
Next time, I will return and try out their combo A for a base comparison. 

Service was excellent."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"The owner, Sue, is super kind, professional, and very good at explaining everything. 
I have been frequenting massage places all over the United States, and shockingly, there are not that many in Vegas that isn't a foot massage place or in a casino/hotel. 

The price...it's on the steeper end in my opinion. $89 for 50 minutes at the end of the day comes down to about a 41 minute massage. You ask why? Well, the masseuse came to retrieve me about 3-4 minutes after my appointment time. Then, you get into the room, and take off your clothes, and wait for your masseuse to come. That just added an extra 5 minutes on average. The massage itself comes down to about 41 minutes at best. Most places I have been to offer 60 minute massages. 

The other thing that lingers and bothers me is that, my masseuse was walking out a customer 3 minutes after my appointment time, and got me to go into his room immediately after. I don't know when he would have had the time to change the sheets on the bed if we were back to back? I just hope that this is just my assumption. 

The quality of the masseuses- I've only had 2, but really enjoyed Antonio. He was very good at deep tissue, highly informative about the body, and really got into my knots. He'll be my go-to guy at this place. Joey was the other, who was sweet, but I personally prefer my massages to be a bit on the deeper side. 

The place is clean, and I really like the level of professionalism that they offer here. There is a membership you can join where you would pay $79/month for your first 50 min. massage (and must visit every month) and any subsequent massages are $39 for 50 minutes. You can share this with a family member of friend. 

If you've got a family of people that all need massages, the idea is the more you go, the better deal you're getting within the month. i will have to give this place a couple more go's before I commit."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"Your experience here apparently is dependent upon your bartender. We had a good one who kept checking in on more drinks and was on top of his game. Then comes the bartender on the graveyard shift from midnight. 

I asked for nachos. No meat, just plain nachos, which on the menu said they were $8.99. Later on, he brings the check, charging me $11.99 for ""beef nachos."" I told this guy, ""I didn't order beef nachos I got nachos."" He then proceeded to tell me that this price was the regular nachos. As I was about to explain to him, he walks away, crumpling the check in his hands, so I thought he was going to the cash register to get us a new check with the accurate price. 

No...this guy was by far the most passive aggressive person I have ever dealt with. He kept walking around serving other people, doing other things, while I continued to stare at him, waiting for our corrected check. 15 minutes goes by. I'm thinking what the heck...does this guy just want us to leave over his own mistake? I wanted to ask him for the menu to prove to him that he had overcharged us, but he was avoiding us completely. I wasn't trying to get free nachos. I was perfectly fine paying for what I had ordered but merely wanted him to correct his mistake of charging me for beef nachos (which is an extra $3 charge) instead of regular nachos.  It ain't about the $3 folks, it's a matter of principle. Finally my friend flags him down and asks him to get the check. He comes back with a check for nachos charging the same $11.99. This guy just didn't get it!!!!!! 

Since he was clearly adamant about avoiding any conversation with me, we just gave up and paid for the extra charges he billed us. 

Never going back here again. Geez, I don't know what was with his attitude when he was in the wrong. Some people told me I should have just left after he crumpled my check and threw it away. I don't know who does that? 

Totally ruined my night."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"I'll just keep it simple and start with the top foods:

Baby octopus in garlic butter sauce- 5 star. This is a memorable dish hands down. 

Grilled mackerel - 5 star. Cooked perfectly, tasted sooooo delightful, and hey, this is by far one of the healthiest protein dishes you could eat. 

Tsukune (Ground chicken yakitori) - 5 star. One of the best I've ever had. It rivals some top yakitori places in Sawtelle/Los Angeles area. Oh, and Tokyo. 

Ume ochazuke (Japanese traditional rice tea with sour plum) - 5 star. This was legit, and seriously, the BEST I have EVER had in my lifetime. I'd come back just to get this. It's a simple dish, but so authentic to Japanese culture. Broth was amazing. 

Pork yakitori (yakitori)- 4 star. It doesn't beat kurobuta pork cheek from Raku, but it's not too far behind. 

The other dishes were an okay for me: 
Spicy tuna dip with rice crackers- was rather sweet than spicy. I'll skip this next time. 
Chicken and green onion skewer- 2 star. 
Chicken gizzard - 1 star. This is my fave item to order for skewers and it fell short in it's flavor as well as the texture. 
Mentaiko (have no clue what that is in English) potato salad- 1 star. It wasn't to my liking. I'd perhaps stick with the blue cheese potato salad just to try it out. 
Nabeyaki udon noodles - 2 star. Broth was delicious, but the noodles were overcooked when the dish arrived. As time passes, it becomes extremely overcooked, due to the high temperature of the soup. 

Service- 5 star. The place has great ambiance, nice happy hour deal starting 
10-2 p.m., where you will get a deal on a pitcher of bear, and some other alcoholic beverages. They have a Saturday happy hour deal for shoyu ramen for $5 currently.  

Wait staff was incredible. It's nice to see so many Japanese workers in one restaurant, since it's quite rare in vegas.

This place is one of a kind, and definitely worth visiting. I'll be coming back for the notable items."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"This is probably one of the best Schezuan restaurants in Las Vegas or America??  I'm unfortunately not able to share what it's like in the motherland. One can only wish...

Wonton in chili oil- 4.5 stars. I love spicy food and usually order this because of the combination of wontons with a tad of spice. This is the least spiciest version I've had; however, dare I say that this was one of the best wontons I have ever had. The meat filling is legit-- it's packed  and has amazing flavors. I was able to taste the marinade inside the filling and it was juicy, too! The wonton skin was also perfectly cooked--not too soggy. 

Boiled fish with green pepper sauce- 4 stars. 
I guess it's Jonathan Gold approved. But Mr. Gold and I don't always agree (ahem, Lotus of Siam) so I was just chillin' wondering if we'd be on the same page this time. I have grown to love the spicy dishes with peppercorn, but usually have ordered it in the reddish sauce at other restaurants. This broth is so clear and delicious looking, but it turns out I saw the article in time, and the broth is not meant to be eaten. The fish was cooked perfectly, but I personally prefer this dish with other types of meats and also in the red sauce/stew. It also isn't too spicy IMHO until you eat a peppercorn. Then good luck. You better make sure that water is on its way. 

Chicken in garlic sauce- 4.5 stars. My first, best and most fave version was in Paris. Yeah, so strange, but this dish is the closest to the one I had. The chicken is cooked perfectly and the flavor was ON POINT. The best in Vegas so far. FYI it's a cold dish. 

Toothpick Cumin lamb- 5 stars.
My favorite dish of the night. The lamb chunks are nice sized meats, it was cooked to perfection and the flavor is amazing. I highly recommend it!!!!! 

Price is competitive with other Schezuan restaurants. Service was on point, and I will definitely be back to try more. I saw an earlier review on cash only...they take CC FYI."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"So the chef/owner opened this establishment after his successes in Los Angeels with Hondaya Izakaya, and a bunch of other Hondaya restaurants. I've had the Izakaya in L.A., and several people I know are fans as well. 

What I ate: 

Steamed clams in garlic soup/sauce- 5 star. SOOOOOOO GOOD. I don't even like clams very much and LOVED this dish. The clams were cooked to perfection, and the garlic soupy broth just makes this dish stellar. I think I could eat 5 bowls of this. 

Yakisoba - 5 star.  I've had so many different Yakisoba's in Japan. This one was very good. Unlike most places, it had a ton of veggies, and a couple pieces of really yummy pork. MAKE SURE YOU GET IT WITH PORK, not chicken or beef. 

Fried octopus- 5 star. Everyone at the table loved this dish. It's crispy and delicious. 

Chicken porridge (chicken zosui)- 3  star. This was good, but I have had better before. The broth could have been a bit more flavorful. 

Spicy miso ramen- 3 star.  It was good, not extraordinary. The spice level if average, and the miso flavor is a bit weak. But hey, this ain't no ramen place. 

Halibut carpaccio with uni on top- 3 star. I thought this was an OK. Some other people liked it so, it could be a personal preference. 

Salted chicken wings- 3 star.  The chicken was a bit hard on the inside, slightly over cooked. I loved the outside flavoring. Make sure to sprinkle some SICHIMI (Japanese red pepper) on it, and it will be a game changer. 

Miso salmon sashimi- 2 star.  I wasn't particularly fond of the flavor of the miso. 
Spicy tuna on crispy rice- 1 star. I personally did not like the flavor of the spicy tuna at all. 

Service- 5 stars.  I'd come back here to try more items, as the menu is extensive. The service was on point, and it's a nice place to come with a small group of people (up to 4).  There's only one table that I saw that can seat a larger group.  Portions are small for the appetizers/tapas, so if sharing, maybe 4 people can get a bite at most."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"I swear I thought this place was a Korean restaurant, where some immigrants couldn't spell ""Galbi"" correctly in English. Heh, jokes on me now. I def didn't take French class back in school. Anyways, went here for a birthday celebration. 

Fresh baked free bread- 3 star. It was good, but I've had better. Why couldn't they make this better considering that it's a French resto?

Bone-in rib-eye- 5 star. It was a tad tad tad bit overly seasoned (with salt) but it was cooked to perfection, with charring on the outside. I had mine medium rare, and it was delicious. The fries (think french fry chips) were okay. I wish they'd stick with regular pomme frites. The burnaise sauce was SOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOD. Dip that meat in the sauce and it's a game changer! 

Caramelized scallops with pumpkin puree and brussel sprouts- 4 star. The scallops were OK. It was delicious, but scallops are scallops no matter where you go I guess, as long as it's cooked correctly. The standout is the BRUSSEL SPROUTS that were included. This is what brought the dish up from a 2 to a 4 star. 
They were the BEST Brussel Sprouts I have EVER had in my life. It was charred on the edges, and just enough crunch to make this pungent veggie go from nasty to 
fantabulous. You can order these as a side. 

Mussels Mariniere (white wine and herbs) - 3 stars. I wish there was a bit more lemon or garlic flavor in the sauce. It was OK for me. I couldn't even taste the saffron (or maybe it wasn't even in it?) 

Macaroni Gratin- 3 star. This was good, but a very tiny portion as a side for $7.95. It wasn't spectacular or memorable, and I'd skip this next time. Plus, it's carby...I just did you a huge favor. 

Free dessert for my bday- some Eclair with ice cream. Meh, but it was free. 

As strange as this may sound, I'd go back here JUST to eat the brussels sprouts. I'm drooling thinking of this veggie that normally smells like someone let out a huge fart and left it lingering for a hot minute. I have been ""de-traumatized"" via the Mon Ami Gabi experience."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"Eating here was such a unique experience. Since I'm a huge fan of Raku, the dessert next door was a place I had to check out. I went here not expecting anything much, except to be at a typical dessert cafe. Boy, was I wrong. 

The decor is modern and hip, with a glass wall of bottles along the entry way. Everything's in white and the open kitchen that's set up with the best tools from All-Clad and the cutest utensils resembles my dream kitchen. 

I got the pre fixe menu ($19). If you share this pre-fixe menu, they bump up the price. So for whatever, reason the calculations added up so that it was best for my bf and I to get one pre fixe menu plus 1 a la carte item. 

First, the menu was edible. Without having read the reviews, my instincts kicked in, and I asked the waitress if the menu was edible to which she responded, ""try it."" I smelled it and licked it and then thought they were playing some practical joke on me so I stopped, feeling really embarrassed. I'm glad I was wrong. 

I ordered the Red Rock. I for some reason expected a chocolate flavor but it was something else. The cream puff was just an OK for me. 

The other additional a la carte was the Mt. Fuji (chestnut cream cake) which is one of the most popular cakes in Japan. Since I've grown up all my life eating this cake, I was a bit disappointed in the flavor. Normally the chestnut cream is yellowish as it's more condensed. Here, I think they use less and I couldn't taste the chestnut as much.  

i think the best part of my dessert dish was the yuzu marshmallows. I was so amazed by the taste as well as texture. 

The tea was awesome. Can't remember which one I had, but I don't think you can go wrong. I'm still curious about going back to try the other chocolate tower cake as well as the water that's imported from Japan. 

In terms of creativity this place is a solid 5 star. I knocked one star off just because the taste wasn't up to par as the appearance/presentation of the desserts. (I hear the booing. Forgive me, but I'm keeping it real)"
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"I was seriously craving some good miso ramen after recently having had a great one in Cali. I figured why not go to a miso ramen specialty place. 

The kome miso, which is the more typical broth found in Tokyo was my preference over the mame miso, which is made from red miso paste. 

I personally love thicker noodles so both ramens were ordered in the kinky noodle woooooo. 

The side of spicy miso is not like ramen Sora where there's ground meat and extra stuff incorporated. To the least, I was expecting some mixture of miso with spice, but it was korean chilli pepper paste, which is a huge shocker. Since Korean chilli paste has such a distinct flavor, and I didn't want to taint the miso flavor, I tried adding only a little bit halfway through. 

I thought the broth is good. Unfortunately, it's not the best ever. The chashu is mehhhhh. It's a bit tough and dry. I personally like mine to be so tender that it almost falls apart when you're picking it up with the chopstick. Usually I would be so happy getting three pieces, but I only touched one. 

The only thing I would be concerned is that the floors next to our table were dirty and gross. I couldn't help but to be disturbed about my food cleanliness before it even arrived. I also found something in my ramen broth that was tough, and I took it out of my mouth, and first thought it was plastic. It turns out it was some tough onion skin that literally would not even tear apart, even if you tried rippling it. I told the waitress to ask what it was. She picked it up, touched it and said, ""It's onion skin."" She then had an awkward silence, and walked away. I find that strange. It seriously looked like plastic paper or something. Oh and I remember when my water cup first arrived, the cup was dirty and had green onion bits on it so we had to ask for a new cup. This was all before I even ordered my food. 

Due to sanitary concerns, starting from dirty cup, to dirty floor, to onion skin in my soup, I'm continuing on my search for the best miso ramen. Unfortunately, I can do without this place."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"I was super excited to try this place due to all the rave reviews. I went here within 9 days of opening, and there were already over 155 reviews due to the soft opening. It speaks for their reputation carrying over from California. 

I like their text messaging system during the wait, so you can walk around the mall. We were told that the wait would be 30 at most so stayed put at the bar area, but it was rather 45 minutes, and that's a lot when you're starving. I WAS HAAAAAAANGRY. 

A great idea and concept that they have a variety of tapas available besides korean BBQ--there is no place like this in Vegas. 

One major critique about this place is their grill pan. It's stainless, and without any oil to properly coat it, your meat will stick and get stuck, unless you constantly move it around. This was most challenging for thin cuts like brisket or bulgogi. And evidently, it would burn so quickly so the grill change had to be conducted frequently. On a side note, we had to ask them for something to put on the grill pan, and it wasn't incorporated into the server's routine. Not sure why we had to ask, since it would save them extra work (changing pans) if they came up with a way to prolong the grill pan cook cycle. 

We tried a variety of meats, and I wasn't too impressed with the quality, but what can you do for $19.99/person. It's a sweet deal. Service was highly disorganized, where you'd ask for your bill to the server, but some lady would come with an iPad to do this transaction separately. I get that each person has a role, but, it took about 15 minutes for us to get the bill, and as they charged for 4 people instead of our head count of 3, we waited for another 10 minutes for them to correct their mistake. 

Since they have barely opened, and are still short-staffed in comparison to the demand, there was a lot of chaos, disorganization, and some confusion, which I assume will be figured in time. I think most important is that even if the organization were resolved, I wouldn't go back due to the quality of the meats and food being average."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"I went here for poke, and walked out without trying any. Instead, I ordered the combo chicken katsu, BBQ chicken, and spicy pork plate. The price is a bit steep for what they give you. One piece of spicy pork. What?

Katsu was good, but I did not like their katsu sauce very much, but that's because I'm very used to the typical standard. Theirs is a bit different. The breading was good, and I enjoyed it. The BBQ chicken is a definite must. I liked it the most out of the three. 

Spicy pork was really off on flavor. I was expecting a korean standard spicy pork marinade but it was 1) not spicy at all 2) a different cut of meat than I expected 3) flavor had some sour vinegary taste that I was put off by, it just was not good. Definitely nothing like the spicy pork you'd expect at a korean restaurant. 

I let the cashier know, and thankfully she went out of her way to do a taste test. Too bad that they stopped making it spicy to cater to the ""American"" taste buds due to some complaints. ""American"" people complaining about something being spicy when it's called ""spicy pork."" Tickles my fancy. Either way, they seem to respond very well to their customer's comments, almost to a fault. There will always be someone that isn't going to be happy with the food. But I say bring back that spice level for the spicy pork. It's like Mc Donald's has warned you the coffee is HOT coffee. Well, I'd say people have been warned plenty if it says, ""spicy pork."" 

Now your combo plate will not come with kimchi because of some complaint that they were served kimchi that went ""bad."" And apparently a lot of people waste it and throw it out. What a bummer. It's super rare to eat ""spoiled"" kimchi because it's fermented. That's like saying I had ""spoiled"" pickles. Now how often does that happen?

The service was great, and the cashier was super nice. So yeah, didn't get that poke because the price was crazy for the small size. The marinade for their BBQ chicken is one of the best I've ever had. It was perfect and had a great char. Not too salty, not too sweet, it was super balanced."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"So, looking to eat Dim Sum on Chinese New Year in Chinatown is probably going to cost you at least a 45 minute wait. Let's not forget the Saturday/Sunday morning/brunch rush. 

I found this place as a desperate attempt to skip lines, get good service, and most importantly, stuff my face with the glories of dim sum awesomeness. 

This isn't your typical ""authentic"" dim sum where you'll see carts coming around. Yeah, I like that part of dim sum, too, but, having had eaten here, I've come to appreciate the beauty of a sit-down made-to-order dim sum. 

For the first time in my life, I was able to be present during my meal, focusing on what was on my plate and appreciating every bite of what was happening to me  rather than having my eyes darting all over the place, looking at what the next cart has to offer, frantically attempting to grab every goodie from each cart.

Pros: 
No wait here. No lines. 
Fresh items that are cooked just for your order. 
Lower possibility of over-ordering, because my eyes are always bigger than my belly. 
Good pricing. 
Delicious
Quick/good service


Cons: No cart people walking around? 

Items ordered: 

Pork Porridge- 5 star. Who knew porridge could be so good without adding soy sauce. The broth was so delicious, I was amazed at how they had made this. 

Stuffed eggplant - 5 star. OMG. Do it like Nike, because this stuff is sooooo good.

Steamed pork Dumpling - 5 star. It ain't Din Tai Fung, but, you can't compare anything to that standard. This is as good as it gets for a dim sum spot. 

Pan fried chive dumpling - 4 star.
Pork Shumai- 3 star.  
Chicken Shumai- 3 star. 
Egg roll- 2 star. Good, nothing extraordinary
Combination chow fun- 3 star.  
Red bean sesame ball- 5 star. Crisp, light, fresh, not too oily. 
Steamed bok choy- 3 star. It's veggie. What can I say. 
Radish cakes - 4 star (special menu). My fave, but not on regular menu :(. 

I can't believe in my dim sum history, I'd pick a sit-down place to be one of my fave and best moments, but, yes, I think I have found my spot. I shall report back after I have tried the other famous spot at the Rio casino...but, till then, I give this place my solid 5 star.

Oh, and I hope they carry white vinegar in the future. I can't enjoy dumplings to the fullest with red vinegar, which is apparently all they have for customers to use for the dumplings.

Don't forget to pick up an almond cookie for 50cents on your way out. This isn't that cheap, nasty, hard almond cookie you can get at CVS or in a box. It tastes homemade, and crumbles in your mouth."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"i was a bit confused as to why this place is called ""Skinny Fats"" thinking everything will be healthy much like ""LYFE Kitchen."" I learned from the cashier  that for every food item, they provide the ""skinny"" (healthy) versus ""fat"" (happy) version of the same dish. At least, that's what I think the girl was saying...

Great thing is you can get breakfast all day here and i was craving for some waffles and fried chicken at 10p.m. 

CHICK-A-WAFF-A-DOPOLIS -- 1 star.  Mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. I don't know if they bake it or how they seasoned the breading for the chicken tenders, but I didn't enjoy the flavor one bit. I ate 1 out of 5 chicken strips. The waffle was also an OK. I asked them  if it was some type of ""skinny"" recipe because it lacked in flavor and texture was a bit odd. Apparently, I was eating regular buttermilk waffles. Looking back, it may have been that I didn't get to slab on a ton of butter like the true fattie way of life, and dunk it in some full fat maple syrup. Hey, if I'm going to order off the ""FAT"" side of the menu, I'm gong to go big or go home. 

THE ORIGINAL burger - 4.5 star. 
I don't know if it's cuz I was eating some mediocre chicken strips and waffles immediately prior, this burger made my night. I was confused once again, what was ""healthy"" 'till my brain kicked in and I realized this item was listed under the ""FATS"" (or ""happy?"") section. Hence, it's a NORMAL burger, with bacon, sauce, cheese, and avocado on a brioche bun. 

Truffle fries- 1 star. Is this supposed to be the ""fat"" version, because it sure tasted like a ""skinny,"" i.e. not as good as what fries or better yet, truffle fries normally taste. 

Service- Great cashiers that are super enthusiastic to be working there. 

So...I'm still a bit confused about the SkinnyFATS concept. There's a lot of semantics going on with them interchangeably replacing the words ""skinny"" with ""healthy"" and ""fat"" with ""happy."" So wait, the ""skinny"" stuff makes one healthy, but not happy?  I went through a whirlwind of confused states trying to make sense of what was going on when I was ordering, and it continued to persist as I ate parts of my meal.  

On a brighter note, I guess I can share a meal at the same restaurant with my vegan, vegetarian, ""skinny,"" and ""healthy"" friends while I shamefully order from the ""fat"" menu and stay ""happy."" 

Speaking for myself, I'd go somewhere else to eat a healthy meal, because it's just too dang tempting to see the non-healthy options alongside. And as for eating some fatty, happy, meals, I'd go somewhere else to ""get my fattie on."""
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"So, in any kind of beauty industry, we all know that a good job is key, but customer service is the other things that makes it or breaks it. 

I luckily found Alex through another Yelper review who was Asian and had a great experience getting her hair died. Having Asian hair, I've had nightmare experiences getting it colored by salons that are run by non-Asian people. I've long stuck to Korean salons for a while, but because of my need to redo my roots, I chose Alex. 

Her studio is small, but cute in the back corner of other beauty businesses. She was super friendly, easygoing, explained everything to me, including the information on extensions that I was interested in getting. I had a consult prior with another hairdresser who was 1) 10 minutes late to the appointment saying that she was just coming back from a gym 2) Had another client barge into the room and insisted she sat inside when there was a seating area outside of this literally 5x5 foot small ""salon"" and 3) the consult was supposed to be 30 minutes, but got cut short to 15 minutes. 

So after that, and seeing how Alex had been patient and thorough in answering all questions during the consult, I entrusted her with my roots as well as extensions. She suggested I get partial highlights for the look I wanted, and wow, I can't believe how amazing it turned out for me. I was scared of getting a ""stripe-y"" effect, but no, she nailed it big time. She de-traumatized my horrific experiences in the past decade. She's going to be hands down my go-to girl for future coloring and root retouching. 

As for the extensions, I had been dead set on getting tape-in's for a special occasion, and paid my deposit, but due to some reasons I had to back out last minute. She was super understanding, and graciously offered to return my deposit without a gripe. 

There's those moments when you meet people, and you just feel at ease and comfortable. I believe what makes her amazing besides her skills is probably that she has an awesome personality. It's like sitting with a  friend you've known for years. 

I'm giving 4.5 stars, as I don't want people to expect to walk in and think it'll be some 5-star salon. Also, it's not the most immaculate in terms of the floors and areas around, but I believe this has a lot to do with it being a one-woman shop, unlike other salons that have assistants sweeping the floor all day.   

However, this place is a definite 5 star in terms of quality, price, as well as the personality she brings. Oh, and I have a pet peeve about people who are late and she was on point with that too. 

LOVE. MY. HAIR. COLOR."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"Hmph. So I had quite a disappointing experience here, so I'm giving a lower star. 

Here's what I had:
  
Out law burger- 5 star.  Meat is juicy and flavor is so rich and yummy. Share one with someone. 
 
The pit Special (4 meats and 3 sides for $20) - brisket, pulled pork, 2 spare ribs, and since the hot links were out i subbed it with baby back ribs for extra cost. 
  Brisket was SOOOOOOOOO good. It was shredded up and looks just like the pulled pork to the point that my bf and I were trying to figure out which was which from our photo.  I didn't like the pulled pork (lacked flavor and was dry) and the spare ribs were okay. 
  
 Sides:  Hush puppies (meh), Corn nuggests (THE DEALIO IS HERE), and kickin beans (yes!) 

 My bf thought this place was so legit, we went back 2 days later. I asked at the front where you order SHOWING the photo of my original Pit Special plate and asked him which meat was brisket and which one was pulled pork. We wanted to get it right, because one was substantially better tasting than the other. And, it was confusing, since they looked exactly the same shredded up together. He told me that the one that I had liked was brisket. 

 SO, I order the brisket.  What do I get?  Sliced meat. It didn't look like anything from the photo i had shown or what I had eaten 2 days prior.  Not only did it look different, but It wasn't as juicy and didn't have the same texture. 
  I found out from the server that the brisket comes in two styles (shredded or sliced). It would have been nice for the guy that took the order to specify it for me if that's the case.  AND, I don't know how he can get it wrong after seeing a photo. 

  Not to mention, I ordered corn nuggets (cuz that's why i came back 2 days later) and when the server arrived at our table with our food, that was when I found out that they were out of corn nuggets. I had paid additional money for this side. So, I ask this guy how long it'll take to make them (because I was willing to wait for it) and the waiter told me ""several days.""   
  My friend went there 2 hours later, and told me there were plenty corn nuggets. WTH dude. I woulda seriously waited 2 hours for my corn nuggets. Or come back in 2 hours for it. But I was told several days, and I was leaving the next day. 

  When you're a vegas native and can access a restaurant any day, probably these things don't matter. But, when you're a visitor, a foodie, and you pick a restaurant out of all the choices available, it's disappointing when you don't get what you ordered. 

  Next time I go, I shall ask for SHREDDED BRISKET. It's SHREDDED BRISKET versus a BRISKET, y'all!"
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"I had a very contrasting experience to the reviews on here. First of all, I called and spoke to Artur and let him know that the air coming from the vent feels cold when set to heat. I was told a time that someone would be stopping by. 

1. I received a message 2 hours earlier than estimated that he (the worker) was on his way. Now, this could be good news for some, but if I had been out running errands it would have been very inconvenient. 

2. The guy went to the attic and did his thing, of course with my help while he called me on my cell phone to turn on and off and adjust temperature etc. So, I was his assistant. Cool, I'm okay with that. 

3.  He was up there about 15 minutes.. The guy comes down from the attic and tells me nothing is wrong, just some dust on the censors. So, he dusted it off. 

After this is when things start getting shady. 
He asks if someone has been up there because one of the panels is inside out. He tells me it's not an issue and a quick fix. 
Then, he tells me that the total is $95. 

My response was, ""What? Why is it so expensive?! You just told me nothing was wrong just some dust on the censors?"" 

His immediate response was, ""Is that too much for you? We normally charge more than $100. How much is reasonable for you?""

WOW. What a pro. I'm female, dumb, and alone basically getting played like I'm at some car dealership. 
Either way, I discover upon my million questions that a basic visit with what he did would cost $65. Uh...buddy, okay. So you normally charge $65 for what you JUST did and you're sitting here telling me it's over a $100 and that you're giving me a discount for $95. I ain't no HVAC pro but I wasn't born yesterday. 

I proceeded to ask if I could speak to the owner (who has RAVE reviews by the way) who basically tried to sell me a membership that made NO SENSE. And he gave me a ""discount"" and charged me $85. I seriously was over it. And at the end, the worker had the nerves to tell me while handing my receipt, ""I didn't just dust off I also cleaned the coils."" 

This was my first HVAC experience, and it is a bit scary when they're up in the attic as you have no idea what the heck is going on. They can say anything cuz you can't see. 
Some questions are why he didn't just flip the panel that was inside out if it's not a big deal. I mean, you're charging me for dusting off some censors, you may as well have flipped that stuff or at least taken a picture for customer service. After all, I was your HVAC assistant doing half the job with you holding my cell phone and adjusting the thermostat to your cue for a good 15 minutes. What if I had children running around and didn't have time for that? 

Anyway, I called several other companies after to find out more and was told a coil cleaning would take about 2 hours. So, are they honest? I can identify one good thing about this experience, but you be the judge."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"I believe this might have been the first or second time I've ever been to claim jumper, and I left with a bad impression. This place was conveniently located after shopping in town square, and a friend was craving for some chicken pot pie. 

Since she had heard that their establishment serves pretty good ones. I was down to get some as well. Long story short, I didn't, and I'm so glad the disaster was with one, not two chicken pot pies. 

My BBQ chicken salad was good- 3 stars.
The appetizer platter- 3 stars. Artichoke dip was okay, mozzarella sticks were gooey and yummy inside, and fried zuchinni's were okay. 
BBQ baby back ribs- 3 stars average. Fried mac and cheese were terrible, and the bread was unappetizing. We didn't even touch it or pack it to go. 

Chicken pot pie- 1 star horrendous. It was extra thick than usual, more so than any chicken pot pie I've seen or tasted in my lifetime. I wasn't born yesterday. And the flavor was even worse. It tasted like they put too much corn starch or flour to thicken the sauce. It was also just warm, not piping hot like you would expect right out of an oven. The puff pastry taste and quality was meh. And that's usually the best part of the pot pie.

We talked to our waiter who initially gave us attitude so I told him we weren't crazy, and that our chef friend had tried it as well. He responded, ""I'm a chef, too."" Okay, nice one buddy. Cuz that's really obvious from where we're sitting. I didn't see the relevance--not like he got to taste our pot pie. 

We got the manager or whomever the boss was to stop by, and he wasn't very helpful either, with a lot of pride about a product that was mediocre at best. He insisted the texture was correct, and that it stiffened from cooling, which wasn't the case for us. 

He then offered to remake a batch, but my friend was so disappointed, and ordering another pot pie was not an option, especially since they had said the inside would be the exact same batch. 

He then stood there for a while asking if she wanted to order another item instead. And when she said ""no,"" he stood there asking her what she wanted to do. Birds were chirping. Awkward silence. And then he said something along the lines of, ""well, why don't you think about it while I take this back."" 

It almost seemed like they thought we were unnecessarily complaining, when my conversation started with, ""everything is great, except for the chicken pot pie.""  

I've been to so many restaurants, and If a customer doesn't want an alternative dish, and the food was clearly not even eaten except three bites, I would think the immediate response is to remove it from the bill. It was obvious that he was waiting for her to bring it up. They ended up charging her for the mini salad that came with the pot pie. I thought that was just to spite her. 

There's plenty of other places in this town that have great food and service, I think the fact that our chef friend could confirm that the inside didn't taste or look right was enough for me to know that we weren't crazy.  Oh, I forgot to add, she actually got sick immediately after we walked out. Don't know if that's a coincidence. 

Sure won't be back here!!"
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"I was initially interested in going to this place since I had oyster cravings, and saw the price deal for $1-$2/oyster from the other reviewers. I just got back from not having enough amazing oysters on the beaches of Nice, and wanted to fulfill my craving. The short version is: I think I came here possibly on a bad day? Sorta the tail end of their stocked items, hence not as fresh perhaps.  

With some stellar, yet mixed reviews on other items, my original goal was to stuff my face with oysters only, but, you know, with all those options in your face, it's hard to walk away with JUST oysters. 

Semi-Spoil Alert!  Oyster prices have gone up by 50 cents! Yeah, yeah, i know some of you don't give a crap about 50cents, but, for one that is super stoked with the solid number of $1 and $2, it is a change. Of course, this was bound to happen with increasing popularity and time. 

Duck Island- $2  
Fanny Bay - $2
Beau Soleil - $2.5
Kumamoto- $2.5

No $1 oysters were available on the day we went and my dream was shattered. We got 2 of each to try them all out. 

My favorite was the Fanny Bay out of all of them, so I ordered two more. It wasn't as fresh as I had hoped. Granted, this is Las Vegas, and with transporting that stuff across the land of no seas, it was to be expected, but unfortunately neither mentally expected, nor noted by me. 

Amberjack Crudo- 4 stars. This was delicious, and probably the highlight of our meal. 

Caviar with French Toast-  1 star. 
I read some review after having had it that the french toast was warm? Ours seemed like it had been refrigerated and taken out. It was on the special menu. And the fact that they erased it off the special menu after our order at 5:30 p.m. (30 minutes after opening) might have been a sign that we were having the ""last bit"" that they had left from earlier in the week. Our waiter told as that they ""ran out"" as he was erasing it off the board. I thought it was okay. Definitely not good enough for $19 for 6 pieces. I somehow just found a photo where this dish had 8 pieces, which makes me wonder...did our serving fall short due to them ""running out?"" Or did they actually reduce the pieces they give out. No es bueno, mi amigos. NO ES BUENO.

So, all this stuff and our bill came out to about $70 after tax and tip. And, we were half full. 
My husband was in a haze of such disappointment with the meal, that he did the unbelievable. We hit up a another restaurant immediately after in attempts to ameliorate our disappointment, and when the bill came, he realized that he had left his credit card at ""Other Mother."" 

With our heads low, we had to make the drive back to go pick it up. 

Perhaps the rave reviews of other yelpers definitely set me up for high expectations for this place. Service was great, with our waiter being super approachable, cool, and waters being full. I even had a nice chat with the chef/owner.  Great interior, open feel, and a nice cool spot that gives a twist with the restaurant name and staff from what one would expect in an Asian fusion restaurant. 

Would I go back? Hmmmmm, I think I'm giving up on fresh oysters in Las Vegas for one, and, MAYBE I would go back for the Amberjack, but that's about it. IMHO, the prices are high for what I think it's worth. Oh, the sweet potato chips are definitely worth trying. $3 for a plate and it's a nice snack."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"I'm far from a sushi expert or sushi snob, but this was one of the best sushi places I've visited in a very long time, or at least as far as I can remember. I've had my fair share of decent to expensive sushi in Tokyo, and this place blew me away with their creativity as well as the quality of their fish. In fact, I loved it so much, I returned the next day for round two. I must add, that it is VERY rare for me to go to a restaurant two days in a row. 

It's nice to take advantage of the happy hour deals and also order the regular menu items to truly embrace the Yonaka experience. 

Bluepoint oysters ceviche- 5 stars. The oysters themselves are not the ultimate best, but the fixings inside as a ceviche really complemented he oysters well. 

Negitoro (HH)- 7/5 stars. This is what got me to return. The tuna belly melts in your mouth. It is amaaaaaaaazing. 

Yellowtail nigiri- 5 stars. Awesome fish to rice ratio. You might be thinking it's pricey, but it's so worth it in my opinion. The quality of hamachi was perfection to me. 

Saba nigiri- 5 stars. I ordered it after watching the sushi chef immersing the Saba in a vinegar liquid. 

Salmon belly nigiri- 5 stars. Maaaaaaaan get in mah bellyyyyyyy! Melts in your mouth. Definite score over their regular salmon. 

Uni nigiri- 5 stars. If you want to get a good overload of awesome quality uni in your mouth, this is the way to go. It has a crispy quinoa on top which was really odd to me since I thought I was eating shell bits for a second. I'd pick this over the other uni dishes. It is a bit pricey at $5/piece but so worth it! 

Lipa roll (HH) - 3 stars. When you go to a sushi place with high quality ingredients, ordering a roll is probably a crime. I committed one with this dish, as the spicy tuna totally drained out the fish flavor, and tempura was okay.

Spicy tuna crunchy hand roll (HH) - 2 stars. I love spicy tuna, but again, at a place like this, it is such a waste to drown the flavor of high quality ingredients with a ton of spicy stuff. Save it for the AYCE sushi joints. 

Saba shioyaki (HH) - 3 stars. Nice, great, and cooked well. 

Sake orange (or shall I say SHAKE orange)- 3.5 stars. I thought this was okay, even though it is one of their most popular items. 

Uni to ikura and scallops- 4 stars. This was very good but due to personal preference of not liking raw scallops and grapes in the dish, I have one star down. The uni and ikura combo was amazing. 

Crispy Brussel sprouts (HH)- 5 stars. This is a must-try item. They were crispy and had a balsamic glaze that added a nice hint of sweetness to the dish. 

Karaage (HH)- 2 stars. The least favorite of the group. The chicken is soggy from the sauce, and I also didn't like the breading at all. It reminded me of a pre-fried chicken that was reheated in a microwave (soggy).

Tea-braised pork ribs (HH)- 2 stars. I wasn't liking the flavor or the texture of this dish. The flavor was a bit strange for my palate, and the meat almost tasted overcooked and a couple days old. It wasn't falling off the bone as some other reviewers have described and had a rather tough, chewy texture. 

Yellowtail midori- 3.5 stars. This is a great dish with fusion flavors. I personally love the taste of yellowtail on its own, and the citrus sauce was overpowering, taking away from the essence of yellowtail flavor. 

Service was impeccable, ambiance is nice, but not too formal. 
The next time I return, I will be sticking to the nigiri's in addition to the brussels sprouts. 

Thanks Yonaka, you've turned my sushi brain on big time. I'll be on my quest for the best high grade sushi in town. And I sure can't go back to an AYCE sushi place anymore because I'd rather spend my money on higher quality than quantity."
B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,"It seems the management or people working have either changed or it's that the usual staff that is helpful wasn't around on a Saturday when I went in for my 30k mile maintenance package.

I've had stellar service for my oil changes in the past but my experience was atrocious and absolutely unprofessional at best.

First of all, they've changed the interior service area with these high counters which is a change from their desks they used to have. The usual crew that I normally see on weekdays were not there. 

I had to ask whom I can speak with when I got in. And there was one person behind this high desk on a busy Saturday. He was unapproachable and just rude.

The worst part is when I went to pick up my car. I went in confused as to whom I need to speak with for the payment. I found some girl behind a little desk with her half eaten sandwich in full view in front of her and myself and asked if that's where I pay. 

She casually said yes and rang me up to pay. No explanation of what they had done, no going through the multiple things they did to my car, and no updates on my car's condition. 

I had to ask the girl, ""Do you know when I need to change my battery or how my car is doing?"" Apparently the 30k mike service includes a check on my battery condition. The girl just shrugged her shoulders and said she wouldn't know. I asked that I speak to someone about my car that can answer my question. If I'm spending 8 times the amount of money than I normally do, I'd like someone to give me an update, not be rushed to make a payment and leave. 

The girl paged the supervisor who came around and told me, ""Some cars need a new battery within a few months and some don't it all depends.""

WOW. I'd imagine they could tell me if it was at 50% capacity or 70% if they're checking my battery levels as part of the service check. 

The supervisor walked away. After I paid she asked, ""Did you see your car out front?"" I said, ""No."" Then she told me, ""You can walk around to the side and keep walking to look for your car. If you don't see it, then let us know."" And handed me my keys. 

MY CAR WAS IN THE WAY BACK BEHIND THE BUILDING where there are NO customers at the back of the shop. And it was parallel parked in with 6 other cars in a line. I was struggling to get my car out of this tight area all the while thinking, ""Am I an employee or a customer?"" 

A guy in uniform saw me and helped me get my car out from this tight space. Imagine the liability if I had scratched up other customer's cars on my way out? What if that was YOUR car that I bumped into? Is there any quality assurance that we are leaving our cars in good hands? How many other customers have had to pull their own car out and perhaps left a mysterious dent or a scratch on my car that I would have NEVER thought came from the dealership?l

I couldn't believe I'd have to walk to the back and get my own car from a tight space when they have brought it out front after a simple oil change in the past. Just imagine me clicking my keys incessantly waiting to hear my car beep back as I walked the long stretch to the side and down to the VERY END and back like an imbecile in 110F Vegas heat. 

It's unfortunate that this is the only Subaru dealership in Vegas. I no longer want to get an oil change or any service, let alone a Subaru in the future. I felt demeaned and quite frankly writing this review brings back horrible feelings and gets me very upset. I'm going to have to find an external source for my future services. 

Oh yes, I forgot to add, there's a coffee cart with no one servicing the area on a BUSY Saturday, while I saw couple of employees standing BEHIND the cart, enjoying their coffee chatting away. I wasn't sure if they were the ones who were supposed to help or not. But they sure didn't even ask or take a second look."

The supervisor walks away. After I pay she asked, ""Did you see your car it front?"" I said, ""No."" Then she tells me, ""You can walk around to the side and keep walking to look for your car. If you don't see it, then let us know."" And hands me my keys. 

MY CAR WAS IN THE WAY BACK BEHIND THE BUILDING where there are NO customers at the back of the shop. And it was parallel parked in with 6 other cars in a line. I was struggling to get my car out of this tight area all the while thinking, ""Am I an employee or a customer?"" 

A guy in uniform saw me and helped me get my car out from this tight space. Imagine the liability if I had scratched up other customer's cars on my way out? What if that was YOUR car that I bumped into? Is there any quality assurance that we are leaving our cars in good hands? How many other customers have had to pull their own car out and perhaps left a mysterious dent or a scratch on my car that I would have NEVER thought came from the dealership?l

I couldn't believe that after spending 8 times the amount of an oil change, I'd have to walk to the back and get my own car from a tight space when they have brought it out front after a simple oil change. Just imagine me clicking my keys incessantly waiting to hear my car beep back as I walked the long stretch to the side and down to the VERY END and back like an imbecile in 110F Vegas heat. 

It's unfortunate that this is the only Subaru dealership in Vegas. I no longer want to get an oil change or any service, let alone a Subaru in the future. I felt demeaned and quite frankly writing this review brings back horrible feelings and gets me very upset. I'm going to have to find an external source for my future services. 

Oh yes, I forgot to add, there's a coffee cart with no one servicing the area on a BUSY Saturday, while I saw couple employees standing BEHIND the cart, enjoying their coffee chatting away. I wasn't sure if they were the ones who were supposed to help or not. But they sure didn't even ask or take a second look."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"New spot that opened up right next to home and being a fanatic of thrift shops but hating the dirtiness of some of them.. this is a great spot for me. They do a great job hyping the new gear they get on their instagram; they definitely spend a bit of time on it and it gets people going. They advertise their popular stuff - blue jays jerseys, MK bags, kate spade clutches etc.

Going in, I was surprised at how organized it was. Literally colour by colour, style by style. Not a hair was out of place. The clothes were so clean and had absolutely nothing wrong with them too, other than a few weird rangled ones here and there. The staff are VERY friendly and care a lot about the store and it's business. I overheard the shift supervisor training her staff and she was very thorough and passionate about the way the store operated, giving instructions on what clothes to buy and reject. Yes, you can sell your old clothes here! Now, you're not going to be given a whole lot of $ - they will buy your clothes at a very low price because they are still selling it at a relatively low price - business gotta make profit, right? But if you're looking for a quick way of getting rid of clothes that you'd donate anyway, this is your spot. They are very selective on what they buy, as they gotta make sure it sells. You get $ on the spot anyway, regardless of it selling or not. But because they are so selective, it gives a pro and con - pro being, if you're a buyer, you will always see new-ish, fashionable, NOT ratchet clothes. If you're the seller, you might not be able to sell your entire bag that you hauled over.

The store has a lot of variety - I saw lululemons, calvin klein sweats (HAD TO COP THESE), blue jays gear (even NEW socks, shirts etc) and TONS of stuff.. seriously I think I saw half my closet here. For half the price. That's rough, man. If you dig, you will indeed find yourself a great deal. Some items are not worth it (kate spade here is very overpriced - they sell purses for the same price you can get a new one on sale at the outlet mall) but some pieces are GOLD, aka I bought a nike blue jays shirt for $8 ayyyy. Oh and you can return your stuff up to 7 days after you bought it, with tags on and receipt - that's something you don't come across in thrift stores.

Tons of good stuff here that won't get your hands all gnarly and gross. Dig, dig dig!"
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"LA fitness is a huge space right in the middle of markham, so obviously half the population goes here. There are things that can be changed for the better and things that are great about the gym. 

PROS
1. Huge facility with lots of cardio machines ..which you're limited to 20min on when busy hour comes.. rough times if you're a cardio bunny, eh?
2. Salt water pool - great for healing purposes and pretty rare to find around here
3. Smoothie bar is LIT. Great prices for whatever supps you need - must be easy since bulldog nutrition is right there.. they literally have a bunch of bcaa, protein, etc to choose from. & it's not all severely overpriced
4. Many of the trainers here are very nice and always smiling/welcoming
5. Unlike ratchet goodlife, they let you use chalk and bring your bag with you. You are also allowed to deadlift heavy even though the sounds are loud.
6. Large basketball court, two studios -one for biking and one for whatever glute activation or weird exercises girls do... I don't know, I call it like I see it. 
7. Changerooms are relatively clean considering the amount of traffic.

CONS
1. Some receptionists are not nice. Like, the only reason they'd ACT nice is probably when the boss is around. There's a fake, rude blonde girl that gives me a stroke every time I hear her voice.
2. They need more than 1 powercage! One does not cut it. There are so many people waiting for one rack.. and two squat racks.. that's rough, man. There was a time where I was literally waiting for 30minutes while foam rolling and some mans comes up to the girl using it and asks her for it, AND DIS GIRL. CLEARLY SEES ME THERE WAITING. and gives it to him. NO GYM ETIQUETTE, MAN. 
3. The plates are weird... it doesn't slide on the bar easily so when I load the bar for deadlifts, I always cut my hand.
4. People that come here are pretty clueless and unnecessary. Not a fan of the crowd at all... some mans hogged the SQUAT RACK FOR DEADLIFTS. are you okay??? Are you mentally unwell??? He refused to step away from the rack even though he had no interaction with it. Also, my boyfriend set up a barbell, turned away to grab a plate and had it stolen under his nose. Whose mans are these???

I also heard cancelling is a hell of a procedure... either during work hours (which conflicts MANY people 9-5) or write to HQ in the USA? Ummm it's gonna be a no from me, dawg."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"I'm so annoyed, I can't ever find a perfect nail spot downtown that's not ridiculous.
I came here before once and didn't like my experience (you'll hear more later) but thought I'd try again because their customer service is really excellent and they are the sweetest.
I usually go to my spot in markham but they close before 8pm and I work downtown so there's no way during the weekday that I can make it.

First experience - amazing nail technician, fast and gorgeous nude and sparkly nails.
However, asked for gel, paid for gel & they used acrylic.. I didn't know until after when I talked to my friend and my other nail lady and she's like ""gel has no smell. gel doesn't use powder at all and no chemicals"" - however, the smell was SO strong during that first time that they had to open the door. They also used powder and claimed it's gel powder. He even confirmed with me ""you want gel right?"" So pretty much what they do is prey on newbies (I was one at that time) and use acrylic with a gel top coat & charge you for UV gel. I thought my experience was great until this happened. Please don't lie to me and say it's gel or anything related; that was in Jan when I got it done and every since then I've been doing my nails actual gel @ different spots every time and it's always gel, never a powder. There's no such thing as gel powder. 
- anyone who has experienced something similar and want to confirm you've been scammed as well, google ""gel nail scam""

Second experience- very recent.
Had my nails done last monday (july 31) for VELD. Just got a simple acrylic+shellac red and Tweetie did it herself. It was pretty, done nicely and FAST. I loved it. But tell me. Why did it start chipping before the week was even done??? I didn't do anything irregular... then when I woke up on Sunday (august 6), the middle one fell off completely. Sigh. Such a waste of $55. They also told me to do chrome nails (the chrome powder/holographic powder), it's an extra $40 on top of acrylic ($35) .... my place in markham literally charges me $45 TOTAL for the same powder. :/ Rough. Anyway, on Monday (Aug 7), 3 of my nails were completely chipped and the middle one was gone. I had no choice but to take the rest off because nothing annoys me more than fugly ass nails. 

I'm so sad. I love the customer service, the efficiency and I REALLY wanted to have a good experience here but I just didn't.. again."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"I'd say this is one of the better malls in the GTA. It's a great big outlet mall with different sections reflecting different items and stores. I like the fact that this is a one level mall, and walking in one direction will lead me back to where I came from, without passing the same stores. I also enjoy how the food court (which recently had a facelift) is smack dab in the middle, making it easy to cross the middle of the mall.

This mall is really pretty, after the major renovations. The new section is bright, and overly excessive with the circle of flat screen tvs on the ceiling. A lot of the other parts are dark and drabby, but not ugly. NOW- my favourite part.. let me tell you the reasons why I come to vaughan mills:

- CHIPOTLE! Yes, it opened here. Yummy guacamole baeritto bowls in my tummy. YASSSSSSS.
- Nike factory outlet! YES YES YES!!! If you ain't looking good at the gym, how can you feel good and do good on your workout? Sales are amazing and I've definitely spent too many paycheques here.
- HR2 Holt Renfrew! It's like holts, but a warehouse section. Yes, true, there aren't always nice products here but when there are, you can definitely catch a great steal.
- H&M. One of my favourite H&M's. The items are different for some reason, and cuter. Checking out is hella slow though.
- Legoland, DUH! Yes I am a kid at heart, and I bet y'all are too.. I love lego keychains and lego sets, although I'd never have the patience to build one and probably die from stepping on them first.. Still looking for a kid to take so I can get into the actual lego land! I mean.. for your child's enjoyment of course, not mine.. achem
- LaSenza! Not getting enough support from your loved ones? Get huge, squishy, comfortable, extra support with these amazing bras. It's under construction right now because it moved, but gaaaah. Amazing and cheap deals here, always
- Urban Planet! It's not as ratchet with horrific quality anymore. It's huge and often you can find cheap trendy clothes here that won't fall apart after a wash.

So, yes. Vaughan is a great mall and I'm pretty much always down to come here and waste time and money. It's also YRT accessible, since there's a terminal RIGHT there, so it makes it more convenient. 
Ps. anybody remember back in the old days, after wonderland where you'd make the trek to vaughan mills for food & then bus home? Good times. #throwbackthursday"
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"Another girl + a few others had the same experience as me so clearly this place is SHIT. PLEASE DON'T GO HERE. No matter how much instagram foodies hype it (remember, all their posts are positive because they get their food FOR FREE). 
I came here because I fell into that trap. 
We were originally going to get dinner at one of our favourite spots and try out a new dessert spot that we've had on our list for awhile. Because of flaming kitchen, we didn't get ANY food AND missed our opportunity to go to the other dessert because they took so long. 

We waited awhile to sit down which is fine. Then we ordered, used our Yelp check in deal for a free pop, which the server was condescending about and was like ""it's only one check in deal for one pop"" to which I responded ""only he is getting it..."". We ordered the food and decided to order dessert too instead of hitting up the other spot because they had a lot of good looking parfaits. We waited 40 FUCKING MINUTES to get nothing. They didn't even check on us. After 35 min, we asked for a status check on our APPETIZER- a mere small tofu dish. She came back and said 2 minutes. 
The table beside us ordered 10 minutes later & got their full order way before us. I guess the kitchen staff saw me looking annoyed because he came out & asked if we are missing something. Well, CLEARLY if our table is empty. Then he came back and tried to play it off and ask what parts we were missing - and then we got him to admit that our whole order went missing?!!???? Then what the flying fuck was the other girl checking and telling us that it'd be ready in 2 minutes?????? 

When we were leaving, one of the servers stopped my bf not to say sorry but to say ""didn't you have a pop?"" and tried to charge him for the yelp check in deal.

I AM SO DONE. 
Do not, I repeat, DO NOT support a place that is like this. If you're a long term follower of my reviews, you know I keep it 100% real all the time. So who will you believe? Your favourite foodies that sell themselves out for a free teppan dish? (again, I'm not personally hating on anyone specifically but IF THE SHOE FITS.) Or moi, who works @ yelp and still has no filter on delivering the truth.

Ps. if you are the owner and you see this, do not ask me to email you or offer to make it better for next time, I am not wasting my time and not interested in coming to flaming kitchen again, so don't waste yours."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"I'm reading all these one star reviews (even the not recommended ones!) and honestly, I'm like.. boooo, suck it up! OF COURSE there's surge pricing in times of need! It's a basic business concept of when demand is high, prices get higher. OF COURSE some drivers are unsafe- I'm sure we all have been at one point. But to give it a 1 star for this amazing service? You've got to be kidding me.

I really enjoy uber, definitely over taxis anyday. The start rate is cheap and they always give you a fare estimate before you go- if it's not in your budget, then don't get in! Simple. I cannot even begin to stress how many times a taxi driver has left me feeling uncomfortable, has left me stranded OR has the nerve to overcharge me 3x of what they promised before I got in. I cannot stand taxis and I will never take one as long as uber is around. Have you never driven downtown on a narrow street just to have a taxi cut you off last minute, creating an abundance of swear words bursting from your mouth? Because same. 90% of the ubers I've been in have been safe, or relatively safe, considering where we are driving. Never have I felt like my life was in danger.. the worst I've ever felt was ""oh shit, he's gonna scratch his mirror if he inches any closer to that other car""- which is not my problem, because it's his insurance. For the person who said the uber driver was lying to him about using his personal insurance, he's NOT. Uber contracts drivers, with a clean driving record & insurance and all they do is pay them- everything else is up to the driver. Learn your facts before giving a service/company a low rating. 

Ubers are cheap, especially if you need to get places downtown (hell nah, I am NOT sticking myself in those sardines-in-a-can ttc busses) If you have a bunch of people, a ride is literally $2-4 each from one side of downtown to the other. They're reliable and it's great how they show you on the GPS where the driver is coming from + the license plate/model of the car so you can easily locate your driver. They also have different options like uber black, uber XL, uber eats, uber carpool and now uber WAV (which is wheelchair accessible vehicles!) 

Ps, if you've never taken uber before- I highly recommend it over another form of transportation. (Pssst, use my code and get yourself a free ride while helping a poor student aka me, get a free ride as well- amyz472ue)

If you're that against uber, then walk."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"This is the first downtown toronto club I've ever been to, so I guess there's a special place in my heart for it.. 

Let's start.
+ PARKING: there's two parking lots very close by - one right beside it (pretty sketchy) and one across the street and a bit down (medium sketchy). The prices are $15-20, make sure you tell the guy you're not staying all night. Always say you're leaving at around 1AM even if you're not. (No penalty, you get a cheaper price sometimes) 
+AREA: entertainment district core, but a bit sketchy. It's right beside tryst, which is a trashier club, but if you ever get kicked out from aria, hey, cross the street and go to tryst. 
+BOUNCERS/COVER: if you guestlist, it's only $10 a person. I've never had free cover here before (maybe I'm not cute enough) but the bouncers are super nice to some (creepy nice) and rude af to others. I guess this is considered a sketchier club (if you're used to higher class places like fith), so the bouncers do a total body check on you. They're scary-mean as well. I hate clubs that resort to intimidation to EVERYONE, even without provocation.
+CLUB: music is AMAZING, off the walls amazing. DJ's are ALWAYS on point. Honestly, probably the best music if you're into top 40's/EDM/popular hip-hop. I love when heather van viper is there. The club is not the largest but it gets pretty filled most of the time. There's a platform in the middle where you can go up and dance, and honestly it's pretty fun. Also, the platform is a good place to escape onto when creepers are pulling on you.
+BAR: drinks are NOT cheap, but girls, that shouldn't be a problem for you... :) The bartenders are always swift and can make drinks properly. 
+CROWD: ew ew ew, sometimes you get lucky and get the people that just want to have a good time. Most of the time, they're trashy girls and scrubs that need niagara falls to quench their thirst. I don't like to generalize, but they never know how to take no for an answer and they'll corner you and pull on you hard. Gross.
+WASHROOMS: Co-ed... that's a problem in itself. It's narrow and hard to get past the constant wave of girls taking duckface selfies in the mirror. 

Overall... not a bad club entirely! You should try it out for yourself at least once to get your own experience because it's always different. The prime time is at 12:30am-2am.
I always come on friday nights so the other floors aren't open yet, so I can't speak from experience on how the 4 floors are."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"I had no idea that this event had a listing or else I would've reviewed it last year when I went for the first time in the summer. We couldn't buy tickets online since they were sold out and had to settle waiting in the line outside the ROM. (The second time I went, I bought tix online and omg this made life 100x easier) The line was way too long but since it was summer, it was tolerable. I'd hate to imagine how the line would survive in colder weather though. 

I don't like the idea of ROM bucks, although I kind of understand how it's easier for the different vendors to operate without handling cash. They are kind of expensive, especially when you're using them to buy a small mixed drink. Some of the vendors are worth going to and a lot of them are not. I like how some are very unique while others are meh- I can get cupcakes and ice cream anywhere, why would I overpay for it here? I remember one vendor had interesting filipino food + other unique items such as ear cartilage (it tasted good regardless of knowing what it was). If you're not really hungry/thirsty, try not to waste your money on ROM $. But of course, that's coming from somebody who is expert on wasting money on stuff I don't need. I like the ROM a lot and I find it to be one of those creepy places that can be very lively. (Yes, the ROM IS one of the most haunted places in Toronto!) The exhibits are all very interesting to me and it seems like a viewing party during FNL- is that what adults do? I wouldn't know. Who let me adult again?? My favourite exhibit are obviously the dinosaurs. The first time I came to FNL, it was the night where china's forbidden city was opened, so it was extremely cool going into it and seeing all the new things. 

FNL is definitely not a place I'd want to spend a friday night if I wanted to have the 'party' or 'club' kind of vibe. The music is terrible and sounds like mainstream radio mixed with terrible beats and drops. Dancing in the crowd is definitely awkward because it feels like I'm dancing in a failed club with awkward people that probably feel the same as I do. Personally, I am not comfortable 'clubbing' with middle-aged or older adults watching, so I definitely avoided the dance floor as much as I could. This party and crowd is definitely not for me.

Overall? I recommend going to this at least once because partying in the ROM after hours is quite the experience. Would I waste $ and time to go over and over again? Probably not."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"Distillery district is one of my favourite parts of downtown toronto, especially at night! Naturally, we came here for our date night. From the love wall, to the strings of twinkly lights.. it's the perfect place.
We came to Mill St. because last time we tried to (during christmas market), it was booked full for like 2hrs straight... this time, although it was packed, they had a table for 2 right away. 

Walking in, it's SO much larger than it appears from the outside. I like how they have their little beer store/tasting at the front and in the inside, there is a beer hall, where you can see the beer brewery! Our table was quite small and it was beside a coat hanger thing on the wall, which was pretty disturbing since the jackets kept poking into the table and my face. Mill St. is super packed and loud, with about a thousand couples having dates and another thousand groups catching up. They've also got a bar area too. (obviously) 
Our server seemed super tired but he was still friendly and did his job well, although he was a bit quiet and it was hard to hear him with the loud chatter around us. 

ANYWAYS! THE FOOD. 
We had a baked pretzel appie, which was SO good. Think warm NY pretzels with a creamy dipping sauce that I'd sacrifice a child for, and a marinara sauce that my boyfriend fell in love with. 
For our entrees, he had this DIY platter thing (forgot what it's called) but it was so cool! You get a few slices of thick cut bread, bowls of different spreads (fig jam, feta cheese, and a few other yummy ones that I'm not sure what they were), thick cut gouda slices, mini sweet pickles and some different types of sausage slices that you can mix and match to make different combos. I've never seen something like this but he was completely satisfied after making his little bread creations. For $23, pretty cool!
For myself, I had the cubano, which is a pulled pork panini with dill pickle and other stuff. It was SO good but I couldn't finish it all after having the appetizer. The dill was pretty strong and the pork was great. It comes with fries, which I didn't really care for. $16.
We both had beers and I think I really liked the one he picked out (Portage?). They recommend beers with certain dishes and that one worked well with the sausage platter because it had minimal taste while the platter had an explosion of flavours. I had the tankhouse ale, which was good but not my favourite. 

I definitely would come back to try the different beers!!"
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"I swear this is every mainlander's first stop right after getting off the plane at pearson. THERE ARE SO MANY CRAZY ASIANS HERE. I can't deal. 

This mall is always packed and finding parking above ground is ridiculous and makes me want to shoot myself in the foot. I always ALWAYS park underground. Loop around the mall, near the valet and you'll see the area to go underground. This is one of the advanced lots, where you can see green lights on empty spots and it definitely saves time that can be used for shopping because you don't need to keep wandering around the lot angrily. I ALWAYS find a spot in this lot and never had trouble parking after doing so- I feel like I'm jinxing myself by revealing it to people who didn't previously know about it..

The mall itself is okay.. it's the place you need to go that's more uptown if you want to shop for fancy schmancy things and brands. Most of the stores are high end or mid-end. The only low-end/ratchet store is sirens, and it definitely looks lost in this mall. The mall is really pretty, bright and PACKED with people. It's pretty good how almost every brand can be found in one mall though- holts (which carries all luxury brands - LV, gucci, prada, fendi, MCM, givenchy, YSL.. list goes on), cartier, tiffany & co, versace, mulberry, moncler.. there are SO many stores that I didn't even know had their own corporate store in toronto. Most of the individual stores are empty because they NEVER have deals (why would they need to?) and it just looks like bored sales associates waiting for the next customer inside so they can pounce. There are also the high/mid end clothing brands, like lululemon, aritzia, zara ..all clothing stores here are pretty professional and you definitely cannot find anything like clubwear here (except maybe ratchet sirens, again) I also find a lot of sales associates that work at stores in yorkdale extremely pretentious and will turn their nose unless you actually express genuine interest on purchasing the luxurious item that day because you're not worth their time but your purchase commission is! ..girl, you work at yorkdale, not own it. Don't get it twisted.

Protip: never buy from a store here that has a location @ toronto premium outlets, especially kate spade. Their sales on special days are usually 20% off meanwhile TPO's kate spade usually offers 50-70% off for no reason. 

I definitely avoid this mall regularly.. who'd want to deal with that swarm all the time?! You guys are crazy."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"Wow! ..First off, I didn't even know there was a main street newmarket.. I am impressed! A group of us stopped by after being in the area for a axe throwing event, and we were famished. A few of us had been here before and it was definitely a recommendation, so why the hell not? 

The place itself is very nice and classy, with a rustic feel to it. We got a table at the back, which had great space and it made us feel as if we were in a more private area. Right off the bat, we were informed that we had to pay a 18% gratuity because we were a group of 8. Meh, I'm not a fan of restaurants that do that so one star knocked off. The service was ok, she came back several times to check on us and she was patient was us even though it was that time of the night and we were being a slightly rowdy bunch, asking many questions and blah blah blah. I am a huge fan of their decor (they have this water jug that reminds me of trafficking moonshine) and wall murals (tobermory painting on the wall). I'm also a fan of places where you can see the open kitchen from where you're sitting. Don't know why, but that's just the way it is. 

Once I saw bone marrow on the menu, I HAD to get it- I've always wanted to try, but it's hard to find. It was $9 and it was delicious!! Salted/spiced just right and the bone fat just melted onto the toast, and then in my mouth shortly after. HUGE FAN. The bbq pork nachos were also on point. Usually when I spend $15 on nachos at caucasian restaurants, I end up getting loads of cheese/tomatoes/bullshit on top of soggy tostito chips. This dish was baked to perfection, with juicy/tender pulled pork piled on top of crispy nachos. That's right- crispy. As in, every single piece that touched my mouth was crispy and crunchy. Perfection. On top of that, it was a serving big enough for a giant. (or my boyfriend, in that case) The other dishes that our group ordered were also good, but their fries were a bit plain and left my tongue bored. I heard their curry ketchup was interesting though? Their drink menu is also extensive and they have beers and cocktails that I've never even heard of. I had this grapefruit/citrus beer (can't remember the name) and it was the perfect cider to go with a meal.

I'll definitely come back to newmarket to try more dishes.. or maybe just get the bone marrow.. but I'll definitely come with less than 7 people to escape the forced gratuity. (seriously, even high end places only charge 15-20% for super large groups, and certainly not to a group our size)"
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"When I first came to this dessert place, I was in HEAVEN. So many durian desserts all made with fresh durian! That is literally the only reason why this place is not a 1 star. Durians definitely get it's own star. 

Anyways... can you say bad service much?
When we came in, the guy rushed us to our table saying 'hurry please, we are quite busy as you can see' ....Ok? So we sat and ordered a mango pancake and durian pancake.. but wait! They were out. So... we ordered something different. 
Let me tell you how our ordering process went- I raised my hand, the guy ran by, we barely even said what we wanted (Eg. we'd say 'Hi can i have the durian-') and he'd be like 'ok got it thanks'. Then 2 minutes later he came back and said 'Sorry, let me double check what you wanted? I'm not sure I got it.' Well no shit sherlock, you barely let us finish our sentence..

My boyfriend ordered a drink (which on the picture was very large, it was ~$5?) and I ordered my durian with black grass jelly. My food came and after 20 minutes, the drink still did not come- in the meantime they made several other drinks and desserts for people that came in after us for takeout and people that had sat down after us. We rang the bell and the guy looked over from the counter all the way across the room and yelled 'hi'... we aren't savages, we aren't going to yell out what we need across a busy room.. so we thought the guy would've walked over to help us but nope... instead he took a personal phone call and went out on the street to talk. Then I call the girl over (after several attempts) and tell her to please check up on the drink. She leaves no response and goes. AND she doesn't return to tell us what's happened to it. Thanks? Finally the drink arrives and let me tell you.. it's no bigger than a typical mason jar, less than half the size of the picture it was shown on. Wtf? Also the straw was thrown in very carelessly, it was the wrong way and also barely in the cup... Dude.. I know you're busy but that's not an excuse for lowering the standard. 
When asked about the size difference for the drink, the guy was like 'oh... well we changed it'. Um then don't deceive your customers by using that in the menu picture!?

At the end, we asked for our bill maybe 2-3 times before we got it. They would say okay and then not go and get it. Okay.. if you don't want payment, that's fine as well...

The only good thing is MOST desserts are pretty fresh and well made, and MOST prices are decent. But seriously, sugar marmalade... get your shit together."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"Please refer to my previous review, because that information still remains true. I have not been having good experiences at dakgogi every time I've been back, and that's a lot. My heart always wants to give it a second try since it used to be so good. Even the owner or one of the workers had sent me a yelp compliment telling me to come back and try again because the experience I had last was 'when they first opened' so the service was bad.. that's not a excuse, but sure..?

We came back for a UYE the other day and that was the last straw. Service was minimal, if not none. The girl barely attended to our table and somehow half our table had already put in their order and received their food when the other half had not even put in drink orders. Ridiculous. The servers looked flustered with every interaction they made with our table and even when they brought the wings over, they looked very annoyed as we had trouble figuring out who ordered what flavour. It also took over 10 minutes to refill our bottles of water. Excuse me, do you want dehydration at this table? Or people dying from spiciness? Please. The menu has also gone downhill.. it used to be so extensive with pages after pages and offered combos. I guess their main focus now is the chicken. Their chicken is amazing and is one of my favourite korean fried chickens in Toronto. However, it's not good enough to keep me coming back. ALSO: BIG TIP- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE DO NOT GET THE CALAMARI. It used to be SO good but I don't know what made them change the menu because it's now dry, hard and tasteless. The squid part comes straight out of the fried part and that's disgusting. Last time I ordered this, we could barely finish it. Waste of money. Their large yogurt soju is now $20.. dude, do you know how absolutely dirt cheap it is to make yogurt soju? Yes, it's my favourite korean alcoholic drink but it's definitely NOT worth that much. 

Also.. no splitting bills. The waitress said the best she can do for us is split it by table. Kind of weird, but ok? Honestly, any restaurant can split bills for you if you ask beforehand ..(all they have to do is put in a new order # for each person) it's just a matter of whether they want to or not. In the end, it was very confusing because they messed up our bill 3 times and we repeatedly had to keep telling them that something was wrong. I'm pretty sure it would've been easier if they had just split the bill for us.

Overall.. don't think I'd be coming back here soon.. dakgogi, you know I always have a small love for you.. but this is not the place to go for cheap wings and alcohol like it used to be."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"MAMA, I'M IN LOVE. I'M IN LOVE AND I WILL SHOUT IT TO THE WORLD! 

Bae look me here for Valentine's Day because I requested AYCE sushi. (I only have it once or twice a year on account of preventing deathly food comas) I walked in and was surprised at how huge the venue was! It looks so dingy from the outside. What also pleasantly surprised me was the fact that all the tables and booths were so spaced out and the tables were HUGE, even for a table of two. (I don't need nobody witnessing me pigging out like its the last day I'll ever eat, ok) 

There were so many people but their organization was spectacular. They had 2-3 hostesses set up for the holiday dinner, which made retrieving people so much easier. One thing I like a lot is the fact that they don't overbook or serve tables with wishful thinking that they're going to leave before the actual people that reserved it arrive. (So common in many AYCE places). In fact, I spotted many empty tables that waited for their rightful diners as I sat down. 

iPad ordering is my favourite and it was flawless other than the fact that 1 or 2 dishes were missed. My favourite things of the night:
- snow crab legs at the buffet table (wtf?! So awesome) 
- black snow roll (it's a Vietnamese style roll with fresh fatty salmon sashimi and avocado in rice paper omg); so good that it's not all carbs
- fruit roll (Vietnamese style roll with banana, mango and peach in rice paper drenched in a mango sauce), it was the perfect dessert 
- kalbi (WHAT? It was Korean style, the same kind you get at Korean places for $19-$23 for 2 big pieces). Unlimited fatty kalbi brought out the carnivore in me. 
- beef tataki (although very small, the taste was distinct and delicious) 
- salmon sashimi (v. Fresh and soft. Pls fatten all the salmon up so I can eat them all) 

I don't think anything I tried was 'bad'

Service was also amazing and everything came out at the speed of the flash. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the fact that it seemed like every asian in the restaurant was extremely impolite to others in the restaurant or even to the servers. There were so many of them and they were loud and inconsiderate. They weren't all related but they sure all acted the same. I was even budded by a 300lb Filipino man that was definitely older than me for ice cream on the grounds that his dad was in the line ahead of me. (That shitty excuse only works when you're under 10....) Not sure if this is the crowd every night but it sure turned me off from going to the buffet table. 

100% would come back again when I feel like overachieving the deadly sin I am overly guilty of - gluttony."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"I think my experience going here as a non-vegan and a vegan is very different. As a non-vegan, it's a 'healthy' meal that I am splurging on and to take cute little pics of and then brag to all my friends that it is sooo cool and cute and that I might think of becoming vegan because of rawlicious. As a vegan, I shake my head at the high prices and the small portions. I still think this place is so cute! Main street is my favourite and rawlicious is like a tiny home. 

Now before you come here, you must remember- this is not just vegan food. These are meals for raw vegans - as definition claims: ""Raw veganism is a diet that combines the concepts of veganism and raw foodism. It excludes all food and products of animal origin, as well as food cooked at a temperature above 48 °C (118 °F)"". Even some vegans cannot commit to the raw life because of the lack of food you can eat. I go here now as a committed vegan and I'm not as about it as I was. 

1. The portions are tiny, and you know if you are vegan, you need to eat more to be full, stay full and not end up binging on something after. (Which is exactly what the carnivorous bf did as he practically sprinted down the rd to pizza pizza shortly after). Eating a vegan meal does not mean I eat like a bunny. I carb the f up, which is hard to do when the portions are tiny and real pasta is replaced with spiralized cucumber, which can only pass as an app. (carbs are your friends, no matter what your magazines tell you!) 
2. No matter what the claim is about how expensive the ingredients are, and how organic and local they are- it is so not worth the price! I make food like this every. single. day., probably double- sometimes triple, the portions with organic ingredients and I stay full for probably 4-6hrs after? After finishing their wraps and other shenanigans, I became hungry an hour later.. 

I'm not saying raw veganism is bad, it's not for me. Not being able to cook real pasta instead of replacing it with a veggie? Not for me. CARBS ARE LIFE. Go on youtube and search up 'what I eat in a day: raw vegan' and you will literally see a girl that ate 10lbs of romaine lettuce wrapped with some dates. Even raw vegans know carbs are life.

I left here feeling undercarbed and unsatisfied. (with the food, not the service - the servers here are amazing) The problem is, rawlicious is a chain made to commercialize vegan food to non-vegans, and that's how they get away with charging them oh so much. If you charge people that much, please consider giving them more for their money.

Will I come back here? Maybe if a friend drags me for a 'detox'. But I'll definitely eat beforehand."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"I think this place is the cause of me never wanting to eat western food anymore because I feel like I'm going to pop anytime I stuff myself with carbs like this.

When I was young, I came here every few months.. THAT'S A LOT. Damn, my family spent a lot of money on this place. Every birthday, every time we'd have a tourist friend over.. we seem to always be coming back! As a kid, I thought the theatrics of this place was really cool and I remember taking numerous embarrassing tourist photos in front of the fake tower of pisa and the beautiful lights after it lit up at night. I loved the interior and I think they did go all out to make Frankie's the way it is. You can even learn Italian in the bathrooms, which was cool when I was young but quite unnerving now as I am trying to do my business. The buffet is set up nicely and it used to be even more grand than it is now. The food now is mediocre at best and I find myself enjoying the Caesar salad and the fruits the most out of everything- which is quite problematic if I'm paying over $15-$25. The pasta is okay but not amazing. There's a lot of variety but nothing really keeps my taste buds going in that area. I do enjoy the variety of meatballs they offer. Another star of the show is the calamari and the ribs, which hungry hands are waiting to grab. The food generally is not bad, but not great. For me, way too much carb overload and I am stuffed after 2 plates of salad, calamari and meatballs. I also like to enjoy some soup wherever I go and the minestrone here is pretty satisfying. The desserts are mediocre- nothing that leaves me speechless or tempted. In fact, I usually choose to go for the fresh watermelon and cantaloupe as a meal closer instead of the stale brownies or weird cakes. Their ice cream bar used to be HUGE, with all different flavours of ice cream and sprinkles/cones offered on the side. I am disappointed now as I see that the 'ice cream bar' only consists of 4 sorbet pumps: vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cappuccino... I think the kid in me just cried. 

I come here now maybe once a year if not less, unless somebody else suggests it. The childhood memories have already been lived and relived numerous times and it is definitely time to take a step into adulthood. Ps. I used to get the Frankie birthday package every year and it used to be exciting. Now seeing the same thing, I cringe and face palm to the fact that I used to enjoy disturbing the entire section of the buffet while sticking my finger into a tomato balloon and taking a polaroid with a scary Frankie cut out. Oh god. (PPS. I'm pretty sure it's not free anymore, so I wouldn't bother)"
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"What happens when you accidentally order takeout from the wrong location? You end up in a busy area with minimal parking, crazy drivers and become 100% done with everything and everyone.

I've been sick this whole week. Sick, to the point where my nostrils are congested, my lungs hurt from breathing, my vision is blurry, my capillary refills.. let's just say they aren't refilling like they are supposed to be. Let's just say, a bartender at a cheap and dingy club refills my drink faster than my capillary refills do their job in my fingertips. You get how sick I am, right? Of course I'm not going to be good. Of course, of COUUUURSE I do not eat plain congee, overdose on nyquil and curl up in a burrito blanket. Of course I don't.

I want sushi. & I want good sushi. 
I call up my favourite sushi place for alacarte, place an order for spicy salmon rolls (yes, I'm horrible), california rolls and some other massive roll they had on their menu. Halfway through driving there, I curse loudly, causing us to swerve on steeles. ""DID I ORDER FROM THE RIGHT PLACE?"" I cry out as the realization begins to sink in. Oh hell na, this sick mess ain't about to dive anywhere near yonge and finch during the busy rush hour. HELL NAH. F***. 

As we pass the cars near the area, I am praying.. just praying that I don't see reckless drivers. I ain't about to kill somebody while I'm on death row here. Yonge and steeles to yonge and sheppard SERIOUSLY gives me anxiety. Thank goodness we make it there and OH MY GOODNESS.. there's a free parking spot in that tiny roundabout for ONCE IN MY LIFE. YASSSSSS!! We're in and out of sushi bong in less than 1 minute, which seriously gives me joy. The store is small, workers are just as nice as the other one, and I am pleased to have my box of sushi resting on my dying body's lap. 

Later when I go home to eat it, or more so, devour it.. I start to realize the quality is definitely not the same as the other sushi bong @ shops on yonge. While the rolls are just as big, the quality cannot compare. I even saw some browning on top of the salmon sashimi on the moon river roll.. and the pieces certainly were not as thick or fatty as the other one. I LIKE FAT FISH AND I CANNOT LIE. To be honest though, the sushi was still better than 90% of other places so it deserves a 3 star.

My stomach was unsettling afterwards but I think it was mostly me being my sick self. With a hint of ""you're not supposed to eat sushi when you're sick, dumbo"" 

Anyways, I definitely will be sticking to the other sushi bong from now on (unless my idiot self decides to call the wrong one again, which I can assure you, will happen)

Sorry for the long and over-detailed review. Someone please tell my 2am sick self to go to sleep."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"PLUR PLUR PLUR!!!! 
EDC, you are AMAZING! Never have I ever been to a place where I felt like EVERYONE was my friend. No seriously, everybody is so damn friendly here and I LOVE THE CROWD! It's definitely a place to let go of your insecurities, inhibitions and go wild with the crowd. Nobody gives a rat's ass how you look or what you're doing, and this is the place to truly express yourself.

EDC is definitely one of the best raves in the world and for $500CAD/$400US (wow the CAD dollar is weaker than the drinks at a cheap bar..), I'd say it's 100% worth it. Large field with literally every big headlining DJ I've ever wanted to see, all in one place in 3 days. This fest knows how to keep a girl happy! Considering seeing an individual DJ at a rave is like $50-150, this is DEFINITELY worth your money. Keep in mind, it's extremely hot (during EDC 2015, there was a heatwave that weekend & it went up to 54*C/129*F...) so prepare your body. Also may be a bit tough for claustrophobic people; the crowd can get super squishy during popular shows (shoutout to me for being a sardine in a can during the dada life set) 

TIPS TO KNOW
1. No bringing in water bottles (except camelbaks and insomniac bottles - empty). No liquids of any type - they'll take away your eyedrops!
2. If you feel anxious/nauseous/woozy/tired, go to 'cosmic fields' (the field RIGHT as you walk in through the back entrance) - there's grass and you can lay down there and feel better
3. FANNY PACK. Always.
4. Zero cellphone reception (uh hello, 150000-300000 people in one place..) FIND A MEETING PLACE, or bring a totem (not only for raving purposes, but for your friends to find you)
5. Comfy shoes - if you usually rave in docs (especially if you're from a place not as boiling hot as vegas), wear something cheap and bendy (vans, converse work too) 
6. NOBODY JUDGES YOU. Don't worry about looking 'slutty' if you're wearing too little clothes or if your buttcheeks are completely out. It's so hot that you'll actually pass away if you have clothes on so LET IT LOOSE, GURLFRAND. (or boyfranddd)
7. STAY THE F HYDRATED!!!!!!!! PLEASE keep water/gatorade (electrolytes) on you at all times. Too many times have I seen people being rolled out on stretchers from dehydration.

This is one of those places where I was 100% sober and had an amazing time. Everything ran through so smoothly - different stages for different types of edm, lineups are on time, firework show on point AND carnival rides forever! There are so so so many things to do here, I go to a stage to rage, then I go play bumper cars, then I'd go trade kandi and then I'd shuffle the night away.


If you're on the fence,  SAVE YOUR $ AND GO!! 
^ Take my advice, and see you all under the electric sky again!!"
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"Y'all basics hype everything.
Sure, it's great that such a fancy schmancy macaron spot from France is now in Toronto but seriously?? Not worth the wait OR the money.
+1 star because it's super fancy looking, with the cute interior and exterior and even the cute little cafe where people can pretend to be bougie. Let's get one thing straight, it's luxurious, sure. 

-ALL the other stars because:
1. Line is NOT controlled. There's been a line daily since opening day and on boxing day of all days, there were no staff controlling a line. Seriously. My friends wanted to line up, telling me the wait was under 15min on the first few days. The line was not moving, there was not a staff at the door letting people in or not so passerbys slipped in and out, not even noticing the line in the middle, or just ignoring it completely. This made the wait so much longer than it had to be, and it didn't even make sense to wait in a line when ratchets hopped right in without being stopped. We were probably 15th in line, and it took 45 minutes to go in.
2. Staff work very, very slow here. The checkout takes the longest because of an obvious language barrier - words spoken are unclear, and she seems confused for her life. Listen, it's great ya got a real french girl here but does she understand english too? Had to repeat questions/answers several times during checkout time, though she was very sweet about it.
3. Macarons are definitely far from the best I've had. My friends told me they were incomparable to other spots like NaDege, but I beg to differ. The macarons, though fragrant, were ..meh. Mediocre at best and lacked the chewy yet crunchy texture good macarons always have. Flavour reviews (obviously personal taste but here ya go)
* orange blossom: 5/10
* lemon 9/10 - by far the best one
* passionfruit 8/10
* salted caramel 6/10 - no salted, just caramel 
* lime vanilla 6/10
* raspberry 3/10 - WAY too sweet
* rose petal 7/10
* pistachio 5/10 - expected way more pistachio flavour to this
* coffee 3/10 - wayyyy too sweet
4. Price... $$$. They offer desserts over $220 while the spots next door offer luxury wallets/bags for the same. A macaron at $3.30 each is steep but not ridiculous, IF it was worth the taste/flavour ..which imo is not. Or you can essentially buy a fancy and overpriced box that holds 6 macarons for $27-28.. essentially making them $4.50 each. But I'd guess you're paying for a box, which you're probably going to toss after. Or keep as a keepsake, but I've always found that so tacky.

I'm not a desserts girl but I know a good macaron when I taste one - I used to be suuuper #basic and have tried many. IMO this was not great and I've had better ones from spots like butter avenue, nadege.. and dare I say it.. even Loblaws."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"Big bite is right. Let me start by telling you my unconditional love for burritos. I LOVE THEM. Especially burrito bowls.. it's like happiness in each bite. Whenever I'm a food court with chipotle, I will get chipotle. It's not even a question. When yelp searching 'burrito' at 12am one night (I know you feel me on this), I came across this 4 star venue not that far away - I knew the next day I had to holla @ it.

The parking lot is soooo small .. most people in the area walk, but if you are parking .. good luck. Spaces are tighter than your old gym teacher's pants too.. be extremely careful when backing in, which is what you'll want to do because I cannot even fathom leaving this lot (which opens directly into the road) with head in parking. It's super easy to find though, right at kennedy and sheppard. 

The burrito place is bigger than I expected. It was also not dingy, like I had expected. With cute retro and sarcastic signs all over the wall, I knew this was the type of place I can f with. Ordering is super quick and even though there were only 2 workers, they were efficient. Pretty much the same speed as the command chain @ chipotle. I was also surprised to see how many options of burrito, the sizes and sides you can get. They even had more than one vegan/vegetarian option!! Woop woop! I opted for the sweet potato burrito bowl, which was under $10 and had guac included. Chipotle can seriously eat it's dust because big bite provided such a packed bowl that I felt sickening-full before with a large portion left to spare inside the box. They also had a lot of options to choose from to put in your burrito/burrito bowl. Corn, jalapeno, tomato, salsa, FREE guac, green pepper, olive, onions and they add in chips on the side for how much extra? FREE! & might I add that the sweet potato medallions in my bowl were larger than life.

The bf also ordered a pulled pork burrito. They called it out within minutes and he started to devour it, the hungry bear he is. As he was halfway done, the man shouted to him and asked him if it was pulled pork that he had. Turns out it wasn't and he had eaten someone else's burrito. Completely not his fault though because the guy making it did call out pulled pork instead of what it actually was - chicken. So in the end, my boyfriend got a free burrito.. LOL. & He claims the mistaken chicken one he had was actually better than the pulled pork one.

I really like this place and I'm glad it's open kind of late-ish because I will definitely be searching for 'burrito' in the late hours of the night again. I'm also a fan of not going broke every time I get a burrito bowl and have to consider if I should get guac or have enough $ to live semi-comfortably for the rest of the week. Achem, chipotle."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"I am so disgusted and appalled by the experience I've received here that I keep reminding myself to write a review about this horrific place every time I pass it on Queen St W. If I can give anyone a piece of advice- DO NOT take the free diamond skin care samples that they pass out to you and insist you take, ESPECIALLY if you are alone. (Shame on me, Costco has taught me to take any free sample given to me) 

As soon as I made eye contact and intercepted the free sample, the guy hurried and rushed me into the store without giving me much time to react. He then sat me down and showered me with sugary sweet compliments that were sickening sweet to the point where it was just.. overkill. He then tried to sell me every single product in the store, but not without testing it on my hand first... my hand was sick and tired of all the product and scrubs that were tested on it within 10 minutes. But this guy... HE WOULD NOT QUIT. I told him I was in a hurry to an appointment (I'm not great with confrontation and can't just straight up tell him to f off) but he kept holding me down and pulling on me saying it would only take a minute. He asked SO many questions and bashed every brand I told him I use. EXCUSEEEEE ME. Why do you think I don't get acne? BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO TAKE CARE OF MY SKIN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I hate salespeople who use the tactic to shame the customer's previous products and it certainly does NOT work on a gal like me. At this point, I am beyond annoyed and I start to get up. That's when, all of a sudden, all the prices he was offering to me before goes half price.... SO.. if I DID accept his previous advances, I would've ended up paying more?! What is this, a real live infomercial? I'm not about it. The prices half price were not a good deal either- I believe it was still around $40. For me, that was a bit too much at the moment, especially when I still had FULL jars and bottles of my own skincare brands at home. Honestly.. I don't even remember what brand they were trying to promote so badly and I remember never hearing of it before either- which is weird, because I am usually caught up on the top skincare and beauty brands. I thought about purchasing the product just to get the guy off my back, but the fire within me told me to fight. Anyway, as I get up to reject the guy for the millionth time, he crosses his arms and his personality takes a 180 by glaring at me and saying ""Fine. Whatever."" WOW. 

I'm not all too sure what kind of business this is or what kind of sugar daddy provides the pushiest sales people in the world but it all seems very fishy. They are all foreign, have a heavy accent and they're EVERYWHERE- not just downtown, but spotted in the kiosks of random malls around GTA as well. Oh well... to hell with your oh so special diamond encrusted skincare system. I shudder just walking by this place."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"If you're smart or actually from Canada, I highly recommend to NOT bank with HSBC. I would rather take a fork through the eye, no lie. 

There are probably 10 people working at one time and not one is competent. The thing is, they are all nice and can speak both Chinese and English pretty well BUT they have to follow their insane policies, which is completely not their fault. The bank policies they have are insane and they run on some other kind of policy - nothing similar to actual Canadian banks. 

Long story short - my mom had written me a cheque and my bank sent me a form to bring to HSBC to just verify that the money had indeed came from my mom's account. It was a formality really and seemed simple enough. I drove here on my lunch to try to get this done. First of all. The premier AND the regular line had the same amount of people and moved at the absolute same speed.... so why are they trying so hard to push their premier accounts saying that they'll prioritize you and you get special treatment? I call BS. 
Anyway I went up to the lady and explained the situation ^ she pulled up my mom's account and saw that it did come out her account, just a few days ago. I say ""great, can you sign this form from CIBC that just proves a HSBC rep has verified it?"" She immediately denies my request and says she cannot sign any paper that did not originate or been produced by HSBC themself..... apparently it's a policy. So I ask her if she can write down one sentence with her own paper then on a HSBC letterhead and then sign that. She also denies that. My mother is angry at this point and says you can do this at any other bank and all we needed was a signature to prove that the money did come from her account. We weren't trying to take anything in or out. My mom even wanted to cancel the cheque, transfer the money to another bank like BMO and then transfer it to me from there and have them sign instead. The teller then told me if I wanted to get anything done, I'd have to have a meeting with my mom's bank relationship manager???? To get a damn signature that doesn't require any work on their end?? And the manager was in another meeting....


????? At this point I don't know what to do so I call CIBC saying that HSBC is bullshit and their policy is as well. They are hearing my call and call the manager over. I guess my call combined with my mom's frustration got an exception because the manager rushed over to do it, but not without complaining and saying that it was a special exception. 
On the drive home, my mom got a call and it was the manager asking why we needed it and she wasn't reading the docs when she signed it. 

What kind of people do you hire here?? And what kind of policies do you have in place? This is the most mess of a bank I've ever witnessed and I am so thankful we have other banks here to use rather than this scheming, for sure money laundering hell hole."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"My first time going to ilesoniq in MTL and I was generally happy with it! For a 2 day rave, it costed $185 for the ticket alone, which is standard. Let's go through everything step by step.

1. Getting there - there is minimal parking, if there is even any. Even the instructions on the website recommend you to take the STM/metro there instead of driving. It would've been absolutely insane to even try to drive near the park. Getting off at the Parc Jean Drapeau station leads directly into the festival, which is super convenient.
2. Getting in - OMG it was SO disorganized. There were no singular lines, like usual raves. Ratchet people kept pushing by and often I'd find a rando in the middle of my friends and I, only to glare him down until he returned to where he was before. It took an HOUR to get in, whereas EDC las vegas with 150-300k people took less than half an hour. So annoying. 
3. Stages - 3 of them: OASIS FIDO, Bud Light, and the Neon stage. Oasis is the main, where all the bigger artists are at. With that said, it's super crowded there. The hill of parc jean drapeau also faces this stage so you can chill there and still listen to the music. Bud light is the house stage and they laid down proper tiling for people to shuffle on, which is good. Neon is one of my favourite stages because of how shady it is due to the trees. It was super sandy and dusty though and after dancing, I had a thousand pounds of wood chips and dust stuck on my body. It's definitely a cool stage, with hammocks and all (let's be honest, it's definitely the stage where people are tripping hard) 
4. Food & drink - beer wasn't too bad in comparison to Ontario raves, they only had shitty beers like bud because they're the sponsor. They were handing out a lot of samples though, of cocacola and even beer, so people stayed hydrated. They also had people running through the actual festival with beer, fruit and lemonade so you didn't need to leave your spot to go get food/drinks. Finding a water refill station was ridic and they took down one of the only ones on the second day??? We had to resort to filling our bottles in the park's water fountain. Food was plentiful & there were many food trucks as well as actual booths. My happiness blew to a new level as I saw that there was a booth named 'Vegetarian' !!!!!! I ran over and to my surprise, it was run by the people of aux vivres, the amazing vegan restaurant on Saint Laurent. 
5. Rest areas - they have a 'havres', which they set up for people that have anxiety, are having a bad trip or just need a rest in general .. very very smart idea and I'm surprised not more festivals adopt this idea. It was so cool in there, with pretty lights and hammocks to lay on. 

Ilesoniq actually took time and effort into making their festival LOOK like a real music festival and I'm sure we all appreciated that. 

100% would go back, but oh god, it is SO dirty because EVERYTHING is muddy and sandy."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"DO NOT STUDY AT THIS UNIVERSITY. DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS STUDY AT THIS UNIVERSITY. I'm serious. As I'm doing my final semester of undergrad, I am SOO glad to be done with this hellhole. I came here because of the prestige of the crim program, but am I ever glad to leave!

1. They don't care about you, but if you have money- you're in! No care on student individuality. They want your $ and that's it.
2. School looks like a prison in all places other than vari hall. I'm at school and should not be terrified turning into each corner/hallway, scared of catching an STD just standing there. Places are drab, and although janitors try their best to clean up the mess, it just doesn't work. There's nothing attractive about this school. Maybe the fountain they turn on for the first 2 weeks to show the new meat that they've made the right choice.
3. Security bulletins every 2 days are not okay. I can't say there's been a single year where we've gone over 2 weeks without some sort of armed robbery or indecent act. IS THIS A SCHOOL OR A JAIL?
4. Textbook robbery.. I'm sure with every school, we're bound to get scammed with textbooks. Personally, I have not bought a textbook since my second year because we barely end up using it and then the bookstore wants to buy it back for 90% off? Bye. 
5. Commuter school in toronto = lots of traffic and people. Too much commotion through buses and random students from other schools getting off at the YU stop. (I guess a pro is that we have a lot of commuting options) 
6. TAs are ridiculous.. really, York, you don't think we notice that you underpay first year master's students to teach us stuff that they barely know about???? 
7. If you want a strike at least once in your educational career, come here!! Ps. did you hear one professor got ran over by a student trying to enter the school during the strike?? #ratchet 
8. Parking authorities are STUPID! I got a ticket even though I had the appropriate ticket on my dashboard. Funny thing is, I bought the ticket 3 minutes before the parking authority decided to ticket my car and claim that ""my ticket wasn't visible"" ...suck an egg. Also, I sent the pic to York and they said go to the online court and fight it (because I'm clearly in the right) and they still dismissed me. Now every few weeks, I get another mail from the university threatening to withhold my graduation. HA, I'd like to see you try!
9. Tenured professors think they can treat you like crap. But they forget the anonymous evaluation we all get to write on them- ha, congratulations, you played yourself. 
10. ""If you can hold a fork, you can go to york"" OK, BUT WHERE'S MY FORK? Such a bad status to everyone else, and they think york is the easy way out. Hell, I wish it was! 

There isn't a single day I'm at this university and don't think 'I hate it here.'

One pro: very multicultural and A LOT OF SPIRIT. But then of course, the schools that do bad academically usually do."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"I absolutely love this mall, even though the parking makes me want to shoot myself in the throat. People don't know how to read stop signs, they shoot out of their parking spaces without a second look, and they will run over pedestrians. 

Let's start with the good stuff!
However, I love coming here for cheap electronics or other stuff that will be way overpriced anywhere else. The one thing I don't like is how the stores are so repetitive- if you're not familiar with this place, you can easily get lost because it all looks the same. Here's a tip though, if you're planning to meet someone here, at all the 'intersections', up on the wall, there's a 'street name/#' so it can make it easier. 
Here's some of the notable stores in pmall:
G nail - relatively cheap (compared to other places) and pretty nice nail designs! The workers/managers are all very nice and helpful.
Phoenix - if you're looking for nyx cosmetics or cheap nail design supplies, this is your place, girl! They have OPI, NYX, China glaze polishes for cheaper than other places.
Phat buddha - I have a review on this so if you want more info on it, go look at that. But great artists/designed tattoos for a decent price!
Lucky Jewelry - if you're looking for AAA quality replica bags, this is your place. I took my real LV neverfull into here and the one Cici sells was almost exact. And I'm expert at telling LV replicas apart. All the other ones from the random stores are just dingy and bad quality or ok quality but jacked up prices. The prices match the quality pretty well even though I'm not a fan of the replica industry.
Real fruit - best bubble tea in the mall (thats right, including chatime), they usually have fresh mango deals (buy 2 get them for $2.49 each/buy 1 get 1 free). Don't pass it up!! The fresh mango is amazeballs. 
Solestop - this place sells your typical 'swag' clothes, obey/diamond/hundreds/vans etc. It's slightly discounted (due to sales), but they're legit.
The candy stores - they sell japanese/korean/chinese candy/snacks and they're soooo good! Hard to find it anywhere else.

The bad stuff..
You can't walk into a store without being bombarded by sales people thirsting for your attention. Even if you don't walk in, they'll still call out to you from inside the store. 
90% of these stores charge a 15% tax rate if you pay with your debit/credit card- if you shop here, be ready with cash.
Also, the security guards that work here.... not sure if they've never had female interaction in their life, but they definitely do not hide the fact they check out every female walking past. Ugh.
PLUS! AVOID AT ALL COSTS ON WEEKENDS/HOLIDAYS!!!! Unless you want to be bombarded by herd off the motherland, oh gosh. 
Another thing, if you're not obviously from an asian descent, many workers will not be helpful to you here and may talk shit about you while you're in the store. I've witnessed many of these interactions before. They may also try to scam you for a higher price than what others pay."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"Busy af. Like, almost all the time.
The gym is nice and has a lot of new equipment but it's not big enough for all the equipment & people it holds... it gives me angina thinking about doing a full leg day here without interruption.

Parking is rough too, like all the time.

Staff here are rude as can be - a lot of university kids working the front desks that don't even glance at you when you walk in. Goodlife wasting funds on hiring braindead people all the time; 3 staff at the front at all times talking amongst themselves and not a simple ""hello"" to be heard. Ever. (only nice person working here is Andre)
Staff yell at you for deadlifting and ""dropping weights"" when you're clearly putting it down all the way down- anything over 2 plates is ""too loud and you're disturbing everyone"" - exact words, yo. They immediately look at you when you're setting up for deadlifts. This ain't goodlife anymore, man. It's planet fitness.

There are only 3 squat racks and usually there's like 4 people rotating each one and another 4 people sitting on the sides waiting their turn.. da fuq????? Half the people don't even use them to squat, but instead deadlift inside of them- get outta here. I've only successfully squatted ONCE here and even then, someone asked me how many sets I have left.... my RBF must've failed me. It pisses me off when people lurk around you after they ask you how many sets you have left. Can't you go do something else??
The weights area is packed full of people and equipment that it's hard to find a spot to do something. The floor also sucks. Who pads the WHOLE floor? Is it because people here only deadlift one plate so it doesn't matter to them? If you're hitting above 250lbs for a deadlift, the floor feels unstable and mushy. Sucks so much. Seriously invest in some platforms or have an area without the padding.
The crowd here is crazy ratchet; half the guys don't workout and instead stand around laughing with their fucboi buddies and taking up room. Most girls prance around in CK bras on their phone, following their boyfriends and doing 1 rep every half hour? I hate when gyms are unnecessarily crowded- I don't mind waiting through someone's set if they're actually working out but if they're just sitting on the bench, doing 1 dip and then taking snapchats the rest of the time, I am DONE. Who invented the thots that walk around like they own the place and doesn't even squat parallel. Bye. 

Good things:
- lots of cardio machines, ranging from stairmasters, treadmills, ellipticals, mimic ladder climber etc. Never too many people on it 
- huge room for stretching/cycling
- cool area with sleds (something you don't see a lot in commercial gyms) & battle ropes.
- 20 minute quick fix area always has room to do something if everything else is booked.
- 24/hrs - the best thing about this place.

TL;DR
Shit people, shit floors, lots of equipment/people with no room to hold it all. Staff are rude as balls.
but 24/7 so you can definitely find time to come."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"I thought I was going to rate this place 5/5. I really did. 
Until the last moments of me being here. 

We came on a Wednesday at 4pm and it was packed af. We chilled at the bar, drank the daily special - it was a longboard lager that was crisp and delicious. And we waited for a table - a table that was already open since we got there and we were told we'd be kicked out at 6:15 because that's when the reservation was. We were 2, waiting for 5-6 others to join us so we chilled, ate calamari, truffle fries etc. It was happy hour and we split! Truffle fries were the BEST EVER. They are legit one of my favourite foods. It was only $3 during happy hour (2-5pm?) SO BOMB. 

When the rest of the girls came, we ordered one of those large sangria 'kegs' for $65 - a pretty sweet deal! We shared the keg, ordered more food amongst us and few more drinks. We were spending dolla dollar tonight! Everything was great, service was great - very smiley and helpful, especially when our sangria keg kept getting jammed with strawberries. 

The bad stuff starts happening..
My friend asked for a beer 3 times and it didn't come for at least 40 minutes. 
The first girl I was here with had to leave early so she paid half of what her and I shared (we actually had the exact same thing - two beers, a split percentage of the sangria, half calamari and half fries) Her bill came up to $37 when she left. 
When we all asked for the bill, it took about forever and a day to arrive. It was messed up the first time. Then I went to the back of the bill and wrote it out for her so she can split it easily - I've done this for many restaurants and I make it very simple. Write out numbers (numbers of bills that need separation) and what each person had under each number. She messed it up again and gave this one girl who barely ate anything a $70 bill and this other girl who had one truffle fries order a bill that said 'half a truffle fries' ... then my bill was messed. Remember when I said I had the same order as my friend? How did my total come to $50+??? So I saw that she charged me the full thing for what my friend paid half for already AND an extra truffle fries on my bill. When I told her, her attitude went 100 to 0. She was so annoyed, rolled her eyes, clicked her teeth and said ""well you guys had a lot of stuff"" ..soo???? Isn't that what your restaurant wants?? Business??? And isn't that your job???
I was so annoyed.
I had to go catch the train and realized we asked for the bill at 7:10 and we were still settling it at 7:37...I paid the extra $ just because I had to leave. I even still tipped the 15% but she was so peeved at us that she didn't say a word when all of us were paying; we all tipped and not one 'thank you'. At the end when we left, all she said was ""sorry for the confusion"" ...bye.

I loved the atmosphere (seriously feels like miami on the rooftop), the food but that service and the scamminess was unacceptable. My boss hates this place too because apparently they just charge whatever they want on the bill because usually everything gets expensed so people don't even look at the bill before paying."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"This costco is horrible!!
It is one of the most-packed costcos of l i f e. That's why I avoid at all costs, except when I'm dragged there for shenanigans.
The 2 good parts: the food and the photo development area.
The photo department is always efficient and quick, and I don't age in the line like I do in the line to pay.
The food is cheap as hell, $1.50 for a hotdog AND refillable drink?! Come here to eat if you're looking for a cheap tummy filler.

I've got to say.. the deals at costco are not even that great. Once in a blue moon, you'll come across something semi-good. Other than that.. meh? The abundance of straight-off-the-boat pushy mainlanders grabbing freebies from the sample tables make me reevaluate my entire visit.
The workers are ruder than anything you can ever encounter.
My friend was asked for her ID when she wanted to try a sample because 'you can't have one without parental consent'. Wow.. my friend was 19 at the time. ID for a sample?! You've got to be kidding me.
Also, once I went there with gift cards from my mother and attempted to buy groceries. I was asked for a membership, which I did not have- however, you are still allowed to purchase, you just need a manager to override the transaction if you plan on buying things without the scan of a membership ID. The worker rudely told me she can't do it, and then when she found out I wasn't completely ignorant like most of the people they boss around, she got all pissy and said ""now I have to get a manager..."" She made it seem like I had ruined her whole day... Another time I've tried to go in to get a hot dog for lunch while my mom walked in the other side with her membership and the blonde lady 'Tammy' that checks receipts quickly rushed to me as if she were defending the doors to the world's secrets. She gave me a dirty look when I told her my mom went through the other side and said I had to go with her or I can't go in. (Which I confirmed later, that you can indeed go into a costco just to get food without a membership.. so, what are you even talking about?) Tammy then made comments and said ""Call your mom."" ...Excuse me? I'm 22 and my mother does not even have a cell phone- she certainly made me feel like a child. Also, even if I called my mom, what would that prove? Couldn't she just lie and say she was inside already? What the hell. I was pissed at this point and gave tammy the 'talk to the hand' and said ""Whatever. I'll go through the other way."" and as I walked to the other side and followed my mom, who was still visible from the entrance, Tammy had the audacity to follow me while saying ""Get her to come here"", which I completely ignored. She followed me until I weaved my way back to the food booth and then she finally returned to her original position. On the way out, I made sure to obnoxiously take a bite of my hot dog in front of her while walking out. Hah. She was making faces, pointed at me and whispered something to the other 'defender of the costco doors'. Real professional and mature, ladies. 

Worst customer service of life- they are unprofessional and will talk smack about you in front of you. Eg. ""Why is this dumb customer's items in her cart still? Does she not know anything?"" - these were true words I've heard while I was in line behind some lady the cashiers were talking about.

AVOID."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"If every ratchet white girl high on a drop of m was a music festival, it's name would be veld.

I'm not a fan of veld. I went once when I was young and never again.. until this year. Somehow my posessed mind told me it'd be different. It was like that ex that lies to your face that he'll change but ends up fucking you over again.

1. First, venue SUCKS. Who the HELL hosts a rave in the middle of a field that becomes muddy, ridden with gross dirt, germs and herpes with no place sanitary to sit down? What is this, boots and hearts? Move your damn venue. It's in the middle of nowhere. Uh, actually I'm pretty sure this is the area where mans gets shot and robbed. I ain't about it. To get in, the only way is to drive or take the shuttle, which looks like it's shipping children to china. IT'S SO PACKED. We parked nearby and had to walk 20min to get near it. WTF? I wanted to go home already.
2. The GA line is messed up to another level. When I looked at it, I felt a thousand crying angels inside. I feel for ya. I'm so glad I got VIP and even then, the entrance took quite a bit because ratchet 16 year old GA-holders snuck in and didn't get kicked out. 
3. Security is another level - YOU'RE SO MESSED UP. Literally think the first girl that checked me on day 1 was probably 16 years old and was like ""oh I'm not sure about this"" when I tried to bring my UNOPEN WITH A PRESCRIPTION birth control in, when it clearly says you can bring medication, especially with a prescription. She literally didn't know what it was. BRO, the dude beside me literally has a bong up his ass, why don't you check him more clearly?? Some security guards didn't even check anything. Annoying girl.
4. Why is a beer $11-$13? -this is the case with all festivals but still gotta bring it up because that's just rough. 4 beers, spent around $50.
5. Uh, the crowd here is like if you plucked every ratchet rebellious child or every ""my father will hear about this"" white boy from all middle to upper class homes from outside the GTA and put them all in a field with drugs. FIRST- CAN YOU NOT DIE OR OVERDOSE AT FESTIVALS PLEASE????? Why are you doing drugs that are not tested???? Why are you doing drugs when literally yesterday you came out of the womb?? I'm so SICK of seeing teenagers being wheeled out in stretchers or having seizures on the grass with paramedics around them. Also, RIP to all the fathers that saw their daughters walk out in their veld outfits. I should NOT be seeing underage in just pasties and a tutu. That's just wrong. That + some messed up perverts = statutory rape. I feel as though the actual ADULTS here (rave veterans like myself and people over 22, 23) dress actually normally and for survival purposes. Also, I don't know how these kids don't get their butts whooped for leaving their houses like that - I'd get mine sent in a one way box to china. Also, these white boys always start a mosh pit no matter what the music is .... all for hype. Though they certainly stopped when I spartan kicked one in the tailbone.

GOOD THINGS/
1. Amazing artists guaranteed every year. TIESTO. YESSSS. Always gold. But stop supporting DVBBS. Just stop. 
2. VIP area was great. Away from the ratchets previously spoken about and kind of bougie. By the way, who tf gets bottle service at a rave? Get a life.

Overall, festival is meh.
I'd only go if I was VIP, and to be VIP and pay $300 for this? It's a hard no from me.
Ps. my sisters friends are all down to go next year and apparently so is their whole grade. They're 15. Have fun."
JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw,"If you are a follower of my reviews, you'd understand that I am always keeping it 100. No lies and brutal honesty are my values. Please keep that in mind as you read this review. This rating is completely towards the business and their practices. 

The servers and owner was lovely to us that night, but clearly they're on some other level of their high horse- keep reading.. There was a thing where we HAD to either get a drink with our meal or be forced a 20% gratuity.. meh? Not feeling that but I understand that it's a common business practice so.. I didn't want to drink so I chose a water only to find out water is served in a bottle for $1.55? Why is this a business practice again? A really bad thing about this is that they don't inform you of the small charges they impose on you after you order something... Not cool! If I knew I would be paying for a drink anyway, I would've chosen something that I didn't assume was free. PS. We don't complain about water because we're asian, we complain because it's simply not a good business practice.

I got the wings in hail caesar (just because I don't really enjoy burgers) and they were alright- super big wings however taste was nothing special. Many members of our group didn't particularly enjoy their meal- the potato wedges were too bland but too salty at the same time, the yelp burger promised two cheeses but it only had one sad measly suspicious looking kraft singles slice on it.. good thing it was only $5! I recall only ONE single person that had enjoyed all their food. The only thing I did really like are the sweet potato fries, very crispy and soft on the inside. They were delicious.

Prices are a bit high, but it's normal for main street markham so no complaints there. The restaurant is also SUPER small inside.. with our group of 12-13 there, there were only 2-3 other tables open that could only hold 2-4 people. **The owner claims in his response to Teresa C that he ""lost business"" because we were there and only made $60 in total. First, there wouldn't have been that much business lost anyway because the place is rarely packed anytime I pass it, AND 100% of the tables on the patio were vacant.. so? Second, making only $60 on a large group is either a complete lie or he counted costs that should not be relevant to the consumer. Let's face it 12 people x $5 burgers each would equal $60. That alone is not counting tax/tip. PLUS, more than half the group did not even get the burger and instead opted for combos, other burgers and even got a number of sides such as potato wedges, sweet potato fries etc. AND most members of our group also had pitchers of beer or pints. My bill alone with tip and everything was $16.19 (yes, I went back to check after the outrageous statement. Picture attached) Simon C. and Rana L. beside me spent about $40 together on their bill. How this restaurant only made $60 on our large group just appalls me and the fact that they are blaming us for losing business.. what were we to you?

BONUS RANT**:
Iwas reading through reviews for here, and the owner responded to somebody's honest review with this nasty response.
""10/29/2014 Sorry we where unable to satisfy you,first off our burgers start from $10.
2nd our fries and burgers are fresh and cut daily, so maybe you should keep sticking with your frozen food because you don't know what real quality tastes like.
3rd we have not once heard a bad feed back about our sweet potato yet but thanks for that feed back because we only strive to always do better and improve.
4th, again... You need to eat quality food before comparing us to franchise, because we have a small menu we specialize in what we got only.
5th you get what you pay for, I'm sure mc Donald is more in your budget and quality level""

Excuse me!?!?! ^ This is completely unprofessional and uncalled for. I have never seen a business owner with the audacity to come at his customers in such a way. ""Keep sticking with your frozen food"" or ""I'm sure mcdonald is more in your budget and quality level"" just reminds me of poor jabs from bullies in elementary school. Just by seeing the way the owner responds to comments, it's easy to see how this place has so many low reviews. Maybe instead of coming at people directly, they should start listening to some of the reviews to change business practices- 10 people wouldn't complain about the same thing at different times for no reason.. hint hint. I understand large groups can ruin a business but so can bad attitude from the staff.

Because of these consequences and the poor mannerisms displayed online, I will not revisit this burger joint and will also advise all of my friends and followers on all social media to do the same."
